sales channel 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50 countries we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we believe distributors provide a costeffective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services from time to time we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition 

these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our revenue and customer concentration is set forth in note 2l concentrations of risk  note 2n revenue recognition  and note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and 

have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial

see note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by end market 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries 

we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to a varying degree of seasonality historically sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

we believe that a number of factors should be used to assess future customer demand including backlog macroeconomic trends customer insights and current customer bookings as compared to billings booktobill ratio we define backlog to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks however backlog may be impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders we have experienced increased demand over the past two years leading to a constrained supply environment in response we have added manufacturing capacity to address some of the increased demand as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled within a reasonable notification period or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty while also allowing certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 

production resources 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler® isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts camas washington beaverton oregon and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source more than half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others and the remainder is sourced internally in addition we operate an assembly wafer sort and testing facility in penang malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and thailand we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products if any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing 

product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time we are working to balance these constraints as we shift our global resources and change capacity where appropriate 

patents and intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 29 2022 we held approximately 4800 us patents and approximately 440 published pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

environment health and safety compliance 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environment health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption manage waste streams to divert from landfills and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems in all of our manufacturing facilities are certified to iso 140012015 for environmental management in addition our legacy analog devices facilities are certified to iso 45001 for occupational health and safety and as part of our integration efforts we are developing a path to certification for our legacy maxim sites as well our industrial hygiene surveillance program minimizes and prevents exposures in the workplace we use two industry standard metrics to assess injury performance and trends worldwide in fiscal 2021 and the fiscal year ended october 29 2022 fiscal 2022 our global injury rates were lower than the us semiconductor industry benchmark 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding substance content in jurisdictions where we sell products contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards substance content of our products includes materials that are subject to conflict mineral reporting requirements compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

we are a member of the responsible business alliance which was formerly known as the electronic industry citizenship coalition as well as a signatory to the united nations global compact and the business ambition for 15°c campaign our 2021 environment social and governance esg report states our goals to be carbon neutral by calendar year 2030 to achieve net zero emissions by calendar year 2050 or sooner to achieve a water recycling rate of at least 50 in manufacturing facilities by 2025 to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics and to apply fair labor standards the esg report is available on our website at wwwanalogcomsustainability the contents of our website and the information contained in our esg report are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

to support our commitment to esg we have implemented an oversight structure which includes a quarterly reporting cadence both to senior management and the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors these quarterly reports include updates on progress against goals assessment of regulatory preparedness stakeholder engagement feedback and programmatic progress and challenges 

cybersecurity and information security risk oversight 

we regularly perform risk assessments relating to cybersecurity and technology risks our enterprise security program has been developed based on industry standards including those published by the international organization for standardization iso and the national institute of standards and technology highlights of the program include 

• a comprehensive set of enterprise security policies and procedures that guide our protection strategy 

• protecting against threats through use of the following measures identifying critical assets and highrisk threats implementing cybersecurity detection controls and remediation practices implementing a thirdparty risk management program to evaluate our critical partners’ cyber posture and evaluating our program effectiveness by performing internal and external audits 

risks identified by our cybersecurity program are analyzed to determine the potential impact on us and the likelihood of occurrence such risks are continuously monitored to ensure that the circumstances and severity of such risks have not changed senior leadership and our internal audit team regularly provide the audit committee of the board of directors with updates on the performance of our program at least annually the chief information officer updates the full board of directors on information security matters and risk including cybersecurity 

we conduct regular workforce training to instruct employees to identify cybersecurity concerns and take the appropriate action we install and regularly update antivirus software on all company managed systems and workstations to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems in addition we have a product security team focused on integrating risk and security best practices into our product development life cycle periodically we are audited by an independent information systems expert to determine both the adequacy of and compliance with controls and standards 

we have determined that an information security risk insurance policy would not be effective and that we should continue to selfinsure for cybersecurity risks we have not experienced a material security breach in the last three years and as a result we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach furthermore we have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years 

human capital and empowerment 

our company was founded on the principle that people are our greatest asset our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes in order for us to attract the best talent we aim to offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to learn grow and reach their full potential 

core to our empowerment strategy is embracing diversity and building a culture of inclusion across the organization we are working to achieve this by expanding the diversity of our workforce creating growth and development opportunities for our employees embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment for all in addition we encourage employees to organize and develop different employment networks which contribute to our broader diversity and inclusion initiatives our current employee networks include the analog veterans network neurodiversity network people of color and allies network pride network women’s leadership network young professionals network the green team and the communities activities board as noted in environment health and safety compliance above we published our 2021 esg report which details our sustainability efforts operations efficiency employee engagement and governance and also provides a look at the state of our organization and an overview of some of the initiatives we have launched to drive continuous improvements across diversity and inclusion 

as of october 29 2022 we had approximately 24450 employees of whom approximately 11400 are in engineering roles approximately 59 of our workforce is male and 41 female our senior leadership team is 73 male and 27 female while manager roles are approximately 75 male and 25 female 30 of the members of our board of directors are female for fiscal 2022 our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 112 

our human capital resource objectives include identifying recruiting retaining incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees we strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry and across the globe by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health financial and emotional wellbeing our compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions and striving to achieve equal pay for equal work regardless of gender race or ethnicity we use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary bonuses performance awards and equity compensation the principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stockbased compensation awards we offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace examples of benefits offered in the us include a 401k plan with employer contributions health benefits life business travel and disability insurance additional voluntary insurance paid time off and parental leave education assistance paid counseling

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business operations industry and partners 

global political and economic uncertainty and adverse conditions related to our international operations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines thailand and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future as a result of our international operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the following 

• political legal and economic changes crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business such as potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the united states and china changes in chinataiwan relations that may adversely affect our operations in taiwan our customers and the technology industry supply chain the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union the implementation of the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine 

• compliance requirements of us customs and export regulations including the export administration regulations and the international traffic and arms regulations 

• currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations including the potential impact of the transition from libor and the current increasing interest rate environment 

• instability of global credit and financial markets due to adverse macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation increasing interest rates and slower economic growth or recession that could among other impacts affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms or lead to financial difficulties or uncertainty of our customers suppliers and distributors exposing us to late payments cancelled orders and inventory challenges among others 

• trade policy commercial travel export or taxation disputes or restrictions import or export tariffs changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the us government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business particularly in china 

• sanctions imposed by governments in countries in which we do business including those imposed on russia by among others the european union the us and the united kingdom in response to the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine which sanctions restrict a wide range of trade and financial dealings with russian and russian persons as well as certain regions in ukraine 

• complex varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements particularly with respect to tax regulations price protection competition practices export control regulations and restrictions customs and tax requirements immigration antiboycott regulations data privacy cyber security sustainability and climaterelated regulations intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance including the foreign corrupt practices act 

• economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the us and its allies 

• increased managerial complexities including different employment practices and labor issues 

• changes in immigration laws regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• natural disasters or public health emergencies such as the current covid19 pandemic 

• transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs 

• changes to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rates 

• fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs due to general market factors and conditions such as inflation and supply chain constraints 

• greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and 

• increased costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans 

many of these factors and risks are present within our business operations in china for example changes in uschina relations the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results in addition expanded export restrictions limit our ability to sell to certain chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies these restrictions have created and may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on us suppliers furthermore if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view us companies as unreliable we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions and our business could be materially harmed we are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in china and elsewhere in addition our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust cybersecurity data protection and data privacy the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights 

we rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts semiconductor wafer foundry services assembly and test services and transportation among other things and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers and service providers including raw material and components suppliers semiconductor wafer foundries assembly and test contractors and freight carriers collectively vendors in manufacturing our products this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields costs and supply chain allocations we currently source more than half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others these foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints with respect to tsmc in particular geopolitical changes in chinataiwan relations could disrupt tsmc’s operations which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and as a result could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations in certain instances one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials if such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement vendors are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers and as a result could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial automotive communications and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that could adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines thailand and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to the covid19 pandemic natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the endproducts in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

• the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products including inflationary pressures which has resulted and may continue to result in increased interest rates fuel prices wages and other costs 

• changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products andor for end products that incorporate our products 

• the timing delay reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory 

• our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products 

• future distributor pricing credits andor stock rotation rights 

• our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration 

• changes in geographic product or customer mix 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states ireland or worldwide 

• the effects of issued threatened or retaliatory government sanctions trade barriers or economic restrictions changes in law regulations or other restrictions including executive orders and changes in import and export regulations including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies export classifications or duties and tariffs particularly with respect to china 

• the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products 

• pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures 

• fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity 

• the ability of our thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials products andor components 

• a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments including china 

• a decline in the us government defense budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities a prolonged us government shutdown or delays in contract awards 

• a decline in our backlog 

• our ability to recruit hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers 

• our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes 

• the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide including health insurance retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits 

• our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• potential litigationrelated costs or product liability warranty andor indemnity claims including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers 

• the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels including with respect to costs associated with labor utilities transportation and raw materials 

• the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government environmental and social responsibility standards 

• new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices and 

• the effects of public health emergencies civil unrest natural disasters widespread travel disruptions security risks terrorist activities international conflicts and other events beyond our control 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand 

as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the 

past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our key personnel including our leadership team management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense and the labor market is tight further we have recently experienced an increase in undesired attrition the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract timely hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could cause business disruptions increased expenses to address any disruptions and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture which we have built to foster innovation teamwork and employee satisfaction as we grow including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success 

we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees the loss of one or more of our key employees and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives could seriously harm our business 

our customers typically do not make longterm product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include longterm product purchase commitments in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on nonbinding forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and hindering our ability to recover our costs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors including our largest distributor and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period 

our industry faces challenges associated with products diverted from authorized distribution channels which could result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect our business and results of operations 

we market and sell our products directly and through thirdparty distributors there is a risk that our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market” in ways that are not in accordance with our established agreements policies and procedures or at our established prices customers purchasing our products on the gray market or through other unauthorized channels may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or that may be contrary to our ethical legal and regulatory obligations customers may also purchase counterfeit or substandard products including products that have been altered mishandled or damaged or purchase used products presented as new each of which 

could result in damage to property or persons further sales through unauthorized channels could result in our products being sold at prices that are not our established prices and could result in lost revenue these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

the extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic will adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty volatility and economic disruption and has impacted our workforce and operations the operations of our customers those of our respective vendors and suppliers and the global capital markets during the course of the pandemic many of the countries in which we operate took and continue to take measures to address the pandemic which at times has resulted in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities including restrictions on our access to facilities we may also continue to take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers which may cause disruption to our business the continued covid19 pandemic could also cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform including in making timely payments to us which could further impact our business financial condition and results of operations the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows continues to be largely dependent on future developments including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic any additional resurgences variants and severity of variants and the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines which are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain these events could adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty indemnity andor product liability claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects including recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive including autonomous vehicles aerospace defense and healthcare where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures any product liability claim whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

risk related to acquisitions and strategic transactions 

our acquisition of maxim involves a number of risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate 

in august 2021 we completed our acquisition of maxim which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger the ultimate success of the merger will depend on among other things the ability to continue to combine the two businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities further there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must continue to be integrated in connection with the ongoing integration of maxim’s business the combined company has and may continue to incur ongoing restructuring integration and other costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies in connection with the merger it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated and actual growth if achieved may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated there can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully in a way that maximizes the combined business to the fullest extent if we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives the benefits of the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to achieve than expected 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons including difficulties in identifying potential targets the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

• diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses 

• difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations systems and infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses 

• strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations 

• the future funding requirements for acquired companies including research and development costs employee compensation and benefits and operating expenses which may be significant 

• servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions 

• potential loss of key employees 

• exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies 

• higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and related integration of assets and businesses 

• difficulty realizing expected cost savings operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and 

• increased risk of costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings 

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

risks related to cyber ip legal and regulatory 

our computer systems and networks may be subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents and a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees have been working remotely which may pose additional data security risks we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage other cyber attacks or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors further geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine may create a heightened risk of cyber attacks which could result in significant losses and damage and could damage our reputation with customers and suppliers if the confidential information of our customers suppliers employees or contractors is compromised our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches cyber attacks defects bugs or errors 

in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees contractors partners customers suppliers or other third parties system disruptions or denial of service which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

in the event of such breaches we could be exposed to potential liability litigation and regulatory action as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to our reputation and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements information security practices and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information reverse engineer or copy our technologies products or processes make unlicensed copies or engage in unapproved distributions of our technology for unauthorized uses or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and may improperly use our proprietary information at their employer 

if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws related to privacy data security and data protection it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation the “gdpr” china’s personal information protection law the “pipl” or california’s consumer privacy act the “ccpa” regarding privacy data protection and data security these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws 

in particular there are numerous us federal state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal data such laws and regulations often vary in scope may be subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions for example the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are broader and more stringent than those in many other jurisdictions around the world the gdpr includes significant penalties for noncompliance and china’s pipl imposes additional operational requirements relating to processing personal information and provides compressive penalty and enforcement mechanisms most notably in the united states california enacted the ccpa that requires covered companies to provide additional disclosures and data rights to data subjects the ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 the california privacy rights act “cpra” passed by voters in november 2020 will expand the ccpa when the regulations become fully operative on january 1 2023 the cpra establishes the california privacy protection agency to enforce californians’ privacy rights under the ccpa since the ccpa was enacted other states including virginia and colorado have enacted comprehensive privacy schemes 

the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by the gdpr ccpa and similar laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services andor require us to incur substantial compliance costs which could have an adverse impact on our business further our product offerings in the digital healthcare solutions space which include the collection and processing of sensitive personal information subject us to heightened requirements under data privacy laws 

given that the scope interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be in conflict across jurisdictions it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure by us or third party service providers to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacyrelated legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or negative publicity and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we are occasionally involved in litigation administrative proceedings and regulatory proceedings which could be costly to resolve and could require us to redesign products pay significant royalties or fines or refrain from engaging in specific conduct 

from time to time we are involved in various legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands and investigations relating to our business including inquiries from and discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations which may result in claims with respect to commercial product liability intellectual property cybersecurity privacy data protection antitrust breach of contract employment class action whistleblower mergers and acquisitions and other matters we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims or other matters that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards for example in march 2022 a putative class action was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware against us and the former directors of maxim as described in part i item 3 “ legal proceedings ” 

further the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement 

these matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation regardless of whether there is merit to such claims because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable our business financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of 

one or more of these proceedings claims demands or investigations there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

environmental social and governance esg matters may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our brand and reputation 

there is an increasing focus from investors customers employees and potential talent as well as other stakeholders concerning esg matters including climate change and sustainability human rights support for local communities board of directors and employee diversity human capital management employee health and safety practices product quality supply chain management and corporate governance and transparency current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing esg data to inform their decisions including investment and voting using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks further customers are also utilizing esg data to inform their purchasing decisions additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ esg practices continue to grow if our esg practices fail to meet the expectations of investors customers employees or other stakeholders’ evolving standards our reputation brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us additionally there is increasing legislation globally which will require us to align programs to their expectations and disclose an increasing amount of information and data to illustrate our position and progress if we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet the evolving expectations of our investors customers and regulators or if our esg data input processing and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate our business financial condition results of operations brand and reputation could be adversely affected 

we are subject to environment health and safety ehs standards and hazards which have the potential to adversely affect our business increase our expenses and adversely affect our reputation 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements and laws particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process and which help ensure the health and safety of our employees we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in particular climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new or more stringent ehs laws and regulations that may affect us our suppliers and our customers such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance or costs to control or reduce our environmental impact through for example carbon offsets as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

• liability for damages and remediation 

• the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines 

• the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products 

• changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available 

• damage to our reputation andor 

• increased expenses associated with compliance 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines 

that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are subject to evolving procurement rules and regulations as well as government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

damage to our reputation can damage our business 

our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers employees governments suppliers and other stakeholders our failure to address or the appearance of our failure to address issues that give rise to reputational risk including those described in this risk factors section could significantly harm our reputation and our brands we may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and services it may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees and repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult timeconsuming and expensive to the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate and brand crises the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands which could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions if we fail to police maintain enhance and protect our brands if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused by others’ trademarks our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

increases in our effective tax rate exposure to additional tax liabilities or substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies regulations or guidance may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october 29 2022 was below the us federal statutory rate of 21 this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation and as more information is gathered and analyzed our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act ira which imposes a 15 book minimum tax on corporations with threeyear average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion we are in the process of assessing whether the book minimum tax would impact our effective tax rate corporate tax reform antibaseerosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions changes in these laws and regulations including those that align to or are associated with the organization for economic 

cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting actions plans could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations 

risks related to financial markets indebtedness and capital return 

we have substantial existing indebtedness and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness which could limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings 

as of october 29 2022 we had approximately 65 billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition we had 25 billion of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility our leverage could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions further on october 5 2021 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes the “floating rate notes” our floating rate notes and our net interest expense is exposed to changes in market interest rates and will increase as market interest rates rise we may also incur additional debt including debt with variable interest rates in the future which would increase these risks 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future operating performance which may be impacted by general economic conditions industry cycles and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to service or refinance our debt we may be required to divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations or returned to shareholders repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential negative tax consequences or sell selected assets such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on conditions in the debt capital markets in addition if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade the applicable interest rate on borrowings under our current revolving credit facility may rise and our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt may be negatively affected 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in our markets in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable andor we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

we may not meet expectations or targets in connection with our “green” financing arrangements which could harm our reputation and business 

from time to time we may enter into “green” financing arrangements that require us to use proceeds for environmental sustainability purposes or have targets related to environmental sustainability for example we entered into a revolving credit agreement on june 23 2021 the “revolving credit agreement” that contains a sustainabilitylinked pricing component which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability specifically greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage for calendar year 2021 we did not achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reduction threshold goal related to this sustainabilitylinked pricing component due in part to increased demand for product which did not have a material impact on our business net income or financing costs on october 5 2021 we issued 750 million sustainabilitylinked senior notes the “sustainabilitylinked senior notes” our sustainabilitylinked senior notes initially bear interest at a rate of 17 per annum and are subject to an increase of an additional 30 basis points per annum from april 1 2026 to the maturity date unless the sustainability performance target as defined in the sustainabilitylinked senior notes has been satisfied failing to use the net proceeds under green financing arrangements that satisfies investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact or achieve targets related to environmental sustainability under such financing arrangements could result in reputational harm and our business and operating results could be negatively impacted 

if we are not able to meet our us cash requirements it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested we intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our us cash requirements we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are not able to meet our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

general risk factors 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters in the locations in which we operate 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions earthquakes fires tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semiarid regions the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

• global economic conditions generally 

• crises in global credit debt and financial markets 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 

• changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance 

• financial results and prospects of our customers 

• us and foreign government actions including with respect to trade travel export and taxation 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies 

• rumors and speculation in the press investment community or on social media about us our customers or other companies in our industry 

• announcements by us our customers or our competitors of significant new products technical innovations material transactions acquisitions or dispositions litigation capital commitments including share repurchases and dividend policies or revised earnings estimates 

• departures of key personnel 

• alleged noncompliance with laws regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees officers or directors and 

• negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers customers or competitors 

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies such as the response to rising inflation and increasing interest rates these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such purchases or sales securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

impact of covid19 on our business 

the pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant operations worldwide including in the united states the philippines ireland malaysia thailand and india each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities including restrictions on our access to facilities 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and shareholders 

while we are confident that our strategy and longterm contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of covid19 on our business the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows continues to largely depend on future developments including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic any additional resurgences variants and severity of variants and the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines which are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain

results of operations 

overview 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 



 

1 the su m of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

revenue increased across all end markets in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of the acquisition which contributed approximately 65 of the increase in total revenue year over year a broadbased increase in demand for our products across all end markets as well as inflationary price increases 

revenue by sales channel 

the following table summarizes revenue by sales channel we sell our products globally through a direct sales force third party distributors independent sales representatives and via our website distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them direct customers are nondistributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers oems other customers include the us government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time 



 

1 the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

as indicated in the table above the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel has remained relatively consistent in the periods presented but can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the geographic location of the distributors or oems who purchased the companys products for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was as follows 

 

1 the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

in all periods presented the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden and the netherlands and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan malaysia south korea and singapore 

total revenue increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to the incremental impact of revenue from the acquisition broadbased global demand in the semiconductor industry as well as inflationary price increases 

gross margin 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 increased by 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of favorable product mix synergies related to the acquisition and higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand partially offset by additional cost of goods sold related to the acquisition this additional cost of goods sold related to the acquisition consisted of amortization expense of intangible assets of 8571 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 1554 million in fiscal 2021 and nonrecurring fair value adjustments recorded to inventory of 2714 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 3311 million in fiscal 2021 in addition gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 included price increases in revenue to offset inflationary cost increases 

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of the acquisition 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of the acquisition as well as higher salary and benefit expenses and higher variable compensation expenses partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated transaction costs 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of amortization expense of intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition 

special charges net 

special charges net increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of charges recorded as part of the integration of maxim and continued organizational initiatives to better align our global workforce with our longterm strategic plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we transitioned our engineering sales marketing and administrative activities from a leased property in santa clara california to an owned property in san jose california as a result we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of the leased property and recorded an impairment charge of 919 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 related to the associated asset group the remaining charges were for severance and benefit costs as well as charges recorded from the acceleration of equity awards in connection with the termination of certain employees in manufacturing engineering and smga roles at sites assumed in connection with the acquisition and various other locations throughout the world 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of a 30075 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 4758 million increase in amortization expenses a 4044 million increase in rd expenses a 3508 million increase in smga expenses and a 1901 million increase in special charges net as more fully described above under the headings gross margin amortization of intangibles research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga and special charges net  

nonoperating income expense 

the yearoveryear decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 2152 million related to debt transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal 2022 related to our debt obligations and fewer gains on investments in fiscal 2022 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were below the us statutory rate of 21 due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income in fiscal 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of 1888 million from deferred tax assets related to an intraentity transfer of intangible assets also our provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2022 as a result of higher income before taxes primarily related to the acquisition for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland at a tax rate of 125 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

net income 

the increase in net income in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was a result of a 15865 million increase in operating income and a 1835 million decrease in nonoperating expense partially offset by a 4119 million increase in provision for income taxes as more fully described above under the headings operating income nonoperating income expense and provision for benefit from income taxes  

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 29 2022 our principal source of liquidity was 14706 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 3074 million was held in the united states and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by among other things reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the united states we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available short and longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 

the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by changes in working capital 

investing activities 

investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from or purchases of investments the change in cash used for provided by investing activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of cash received from the acquisition during fiscal 2021 partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans the change in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of a net decrease in debt in fiscal 2022 as compared to a net increase in debt in fiscal 2021 as well as higher dividend payments partially offset by lower common stock repurchases 

working capital 

 

1 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory include acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the writeup of fixed assets to fair value the calculations above include the financial results of maxim prospectively from the acquisition date 

the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings and increased revenue levels 

inventory increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand as of october 30 2021 our inventory balance also included additional costs related to the acquisition as a result of accounting for acquired inventory at fairvalue 

current liabilities decreased to 24427 million at october 29 2022 from 27703 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2021 primarily due to early termination of debt partially offset by higher accounts payable and accruals 

revolving credit facility 

our third amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated as of june 23 2021 with bank of america na as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders revolving credit agreement amended and restated our second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of june 28 2019 and provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 25 billion subject to certain terms and conditions 

we may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the revolving credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 35 to 10 as of october 29 2022 we were in compliance with these covenants see note 13 revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revolving credit facility 

debt 

as of october 29 2022 we had approximately 65 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments the indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of october 29 2022 we were compliant with these covenants see note 14 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 since inception our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 167 billion of our common stock under the program which includes the 85 billion authorization approved by the board of directors on august 25 2021 under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 

as of october 29 2022 49 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock unitsawards or the exercise of stock options future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position results of operations outlook liquidity and other factors we deem relevant 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 6993 million in fiscal 2022 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to be between 6 and 8 of revenue which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to continue to expand internal manufacturing capacity these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available short and longterm financing 

dividends 

on november 21 2022 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 076 per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 15 2022 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 5 2022 and is expected to total approximately 3871 million we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our material contractual obligations in specified periods as of october 29 2022 

 

1 debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity 

2 tax obligation relates to the onetime tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018 

3 certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 

4 we have supplier commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities 

as of october 29 2022 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 1944 million which are 

included in noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2s new accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have entered into a binding agreement 2 the performance obligations have been identified 3 the transaction price to the customer has been determined 4 the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 the performance obligations have been satisfied the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes in those instances we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed shipping costs are charged to selling marketing general and administrative expense as incurred sales taxes are excluded from revenue 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

performance obligations  substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation the sale of mixedsignal integrated circuit ic products such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer which occurs upon shipment or delivery unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues 

transaction price  the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as 

of the end of a reporting period the vast majority of such consideration are credits issued to the distributor due to price protection but also include sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return referred to as stock rotation price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on managements estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 

contract balances  accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or net realizable value because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment are reflected in our financial statements for the periods presented any deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 

evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about july 31 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value when using the qualitative method we consider several factors including the following 

– the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment 

– the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors businesses 

– changes in the value of major us stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units 

– changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased and 

– whether there had been any significant increases to the weightedaverage cost of capital rates for each reporting unit which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach 

if we elect not to use this option or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to our total company market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

in fiscal 2022 we used a combination of the qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing goodwill for our reporting units in fiscal 2021 we used the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all reporting units in all periods presented we concluded the reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes we assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods 

we account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for benefit from income taxes line of the consolidated statements of income we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new guidance on legislative interpretations a change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options restricted stock units and marketbased andor performancebased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the grantdate fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions is calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting for restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions this grantdate fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stockbased compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition if we determine that an award is unlikely to vest any previously recorded stockbased compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination the grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performancebased stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the monte carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 

the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected volatility expected term riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield forfeiture rate and others the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straightline basis over the vesting period see note 2r stockbased compensation and note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stockbased compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to among other things contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage employment or employment benefits we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on the 5000 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of october 29 2022 our annual interest expense would change by approximately 50 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

based on our cash and marketable securities outstanding as of october 29 2022 and october 30 2021 our annual interest income would change by approximately 147 million and 197 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 29 2022 and october 30 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period if significant such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 29 2022 we had 66 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 55 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of october 29 2022 and october 30 2021 assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to the net unhedged foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 2022 and october 30 2021 an immediate 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in approximately 695 million of losses and 395 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows over the course of the year 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 2022 we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that an immediate 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29 2022 and october 30 2021 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales channel 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50 countries we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we believe distributors provide a costeffective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services from time to time we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition 

these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our revenue and customer concentration is set forth in note 2l concentrations of risk  note 2n revenue recognition  and note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even 

any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

markets 

the breakdown of our annual revenue by end market is set out in the table below

see note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by end market 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors 

varying among products markets and customers we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries 

our competitors include but are not limited to 

we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to a varying degree of seasonality historically sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

we believe that a number of factors should be used to assess future customer demand including backlog macroeconomic trends customer insights and current customer bookings as compared to billings booktobill ratio we define backlog to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks however backlog may be impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders recently we have experienced increased demand within the semiconductor industry leading to a constrained supply environment which we believe will continue in the near term we have added manufacturing capacity to address some of the increased demand and we have also required customers to commit to orders for up to a twenty week period prior to shipment to give us better visibility into the backlog outside of the commitments window noted above as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty while also allowing certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 

production resources 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler® isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts camas washington beaverton oregon and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually internally and the remaining from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required in addition we operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in penang malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and thailand we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products if any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers given the current demand environment in the semiconductor industry we expect to face a constrained supply environment in the near term we are working to balance these constraints as we shift our global resources and add capacity where appropriate 

patents and intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 30 2021 we held approximately 4700 us patents and approximately 400 published pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2041 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

environmental health and safety compliance 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems in all of our facilities are certified to iso 140012015 for environmental management and all of our facilities conform to iso 45001 for occupational health and safety our industrial hygiene surveillance program minimizes and prevents exposures in the workplace and reduces the risk of specific diseases we use two industry standard metrics to assess injury performance and trends worldwide legacy analog devices sites have iso 45001 health and safety certification with the exception of one site from the acquisition of linear technology corporation which is planned for certification to the same standard by the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of our integration efforts management is assessing the path to certification for maxim sites 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding substance content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

we are a member of the responsible business alliance which was formerly known as the electronic industry citizenship coalition as well as a participant of the united nations global compact and the business ambition for 15°c campaign our corporate responsibility report crr states our commitment to be carbon neutral by calendar year 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by calendar year 2050 to conserve resources by consuming less energy and water to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics and to apply fair labor standards among other things we are neither including the 

information contained in our crr in nor incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k the crr is available on our website at wwwanalogcomsustainability 

to further strengthen these commitments to environmental social and governance esg initiatives we recently deployed three sustainable finance instruments in april 2020 we completed our inaugural green bond issuance of 400 million marking our leadership as the first semiconductor company and one of the first us technology companies to issue a green bond in the us debt capital markets in june 2021 we refinanced our revolving credit facility with a new 25 billion sustainabilitylinked revolving credit facility becoming one of the first semiconductor companies to use this instrument in october 2021 we issued our inaugural sustainabilitylinked 750 million bond offering these transactions support our commitment to environmental sustainability by linking financing to the achievement of our ambitious esg targets

• a comprehensive set of enterprise security policies and procedures that guide our protection strategy 

• protecting against threats through use of the following measures identifying critical assets and highrisk threats implementing cybersecurity detection controls and remediation practices implementing a thirdparty risk management program to evaluate our critical partners’ cyber posture and evaluating our program effectiveness by performing internal and external audits 

risks identified by our cybersecurity program are analyzed to determine the potential impact on us and the likelihood of occurrence such risks are continuously monitored to ensure that the circumstances and severity of such risks have not changed 

we conduct regular workforce training to instruct employees to identify cybersecurity concerns and take the appropriate action we install and regularly update antivirus software on all company managed systems and workstations to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems in addition we have a product security team focused on integrating risk and security best practices into our product development life cycle periodically we are audited by an independent information systems expert to determine both the adequacy of and compliance with controls and standards 

senior leadership and internal audit present to our full board of directors on information security and cybersecurity matters and risks at least annually we have conducted an analysis and determined that an information security risk insurance policy would not be effective and that we should continue to selfinsure for cybersecurity risks we have not experienced a material security breach in the last three years and as a result we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach furthermore we have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years 

human capital and empowerment 

our company was founded on the principle that people are our greatest asset our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes in order for us to attract the best talent we aim to offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to learn grow and reach their full potential 

core to our empowerment strategy is embracing diversity and building a culture of inclusion across the organization we are working to achieve this by expanding the diversity of our workforce creating growth and development opportunities for our employees embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment for all we launched the people of color and allies network pocan a new employee resource group focused on elevating and prioritizing the needs of people of color and creating opportunities to support colleagues from underrepresented groups pocan broadens our network of existing employee groups including the womens leadership network young professionals network and lgbtq network which all contribute to our broader diversity and inclusion initiatives as noted in environmental health and safety compliance above we published our annual crr which details our sustainability efforts operations efficiency employee engagement and governance and also provides a look at the state of our organization and overview of some of the initiatives we have launched to drive continuous improvements across diversity and inclusion

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report 

risks related to our acquisition of maxim integrated products inc maxim 

we will incur substantial expenses related to the integration of maxim 

we completed our acquisition of maxim which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger on august 26 2021 we have incurred and expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies these costs and expenses include fees paid to financial legal and accounting advisors facilities and systems consolidation costs severance and other potential employmentrelated costs including severance payments that may be made to certain maxim employees filing fees printing expenses and other related charges 

the combined company has and will continue to incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger the costs related to restructuring are being expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of maxim’s business although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs strategic benefits and additional income as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

combining our business with maxim’s may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and maxim’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the merger involves the combination of two companies which operated until the completion of the merger as independent public companies there can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both companies the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated management must devote attention and resources to integrating the combined companys business practices and operations potential difficulties the combined company may encounter as the integration process continues include the following 

• lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our andor maxims customers deciding not to do business with the combined company or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company 

• integrating personnel and operations from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent highquality products and services especially in the covid19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations 

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses and 

• performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating the companies’ operations 

any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues level of expenses and operating results of the combined company which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company 

in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual growth and cost savings if achieved may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we are not able to adequately address integration challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies 

risks related to our global operations 

the extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic will adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant operations worldwide including in the united states the philippines ireland thailand malaysia china and india each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities including restrictions on our access to facilities it is uncertain what the full extent of the impact and duration of such measures and potential future measures may be and how such measures will affect our vendors and suppliers increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices by among other things restricting employee travel modifying employee work locations and canceling physical participation in meetings events and conferences as a result of our changed workplace practices many of our employees are temporarily working remotely any of these changes may adversely impact our business operations or customer relationships and result in further disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing operations and facilities and workplace we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers which may cause even further disruption although these alterations to our business practices are intended to minimize the spread of covid19 we cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 and if a significant number of our employees or members of our board of directors become ill our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could result in a global recession the covid19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which may adversely affect our and our customers’ and suppliers’ liquidity cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets as a result the continued spread of covid19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform including in making timely payments to us which could further adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the continued duration and severity of the pandemic the spread of more contagious variants of the virus the adoption rate of vaccines the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty including related to the covid19 pandemic trade and political disputes between the united states and china chinataiwan relations and the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers distributors or customers could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines thailand and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

• political legal and economic changes crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business such as potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the united states and china changes in chinataiwan relations that may adversely affect our operations in taiwan our customers and the technology industry supply chain the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union and the implementation of the united statesmexicocanada agreement 

• compliance requirements of us customs and export regulations including the export administration regulations and the international traffic and arms regulations 

• currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations including the potential impact of the transition from libor 

• trade policy commercial travel export or taxation disputes or restrictions government sanctions import or export tariffs changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the us government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business particularly in china 

• complex varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements particularly with respect to tax regulations price protection competition practices export control regulations and restrictions customs and tax requirements immigration antiboycott regulations data privacy intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance including the foreign corrupt practices act 

• economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the us and its allies 

• increased managerial complexities including different employment practices and labor issues 

• changes in immigration laws regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• natural disasters or public health emergencies such as the current covid19 pandemic 

• transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs 

• changes to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rates 

• fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs 

• greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and 

• costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans 

any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present within our business operations in china for example changes in uschina relations the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results in addition expanded export restrictions may limit our ability to sell to certain chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies these restrictions have created and may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on us suppliers furthermore if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view us companies as unreliable we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions and our business could be materially harmed we are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in china and elsewhere 

in addition our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by chinas continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust cybersecurity data protection and data privacy the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights 

if we are unable to address our us cash requirements it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested we intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our us cash requirements we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

• the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products including inflationary pressures 

• changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products andor for end products that incorporate our products 

• the timing delay reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory 

• our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products 

• our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits andor stock rotation rights 

• our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration 

• changes in geographic product or customer mix 

• changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states ireland or worldwide 

• the effects of issued threatened or retaliatory government sanctions trade barriers or economic restrictions changes in law regulations or other restrictions including executive orders and changes in import and export regulations including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies export classifications or duties and tariffs particularly with respect to china 

• the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products 

• pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures 

• fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity 

• the ability of our thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials products andor components 

• a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments including china 

• a decline in the us government defense budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities a prolonged us government shutdown or delays in contract awards 

• any significant decline in our backlog 

• our ability to recruit hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers 

• our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes 

• the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide including health insurance retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits 

• our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels 

• potential significant litigationrelated costs or product liability warranty andor indemnity claims including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers 

• the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels including with respect to costs associated with labor utilities transportation and raw materials 

• the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government environmental and social responsibility standards 

• new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices and 

• the effects of public health emergencies civil unrest natural disasters widespread travel disruptions security risks terrorist activities international conflicts and other events beyond our control 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october 30 2021 was below our us federal statutory rate of 21 this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits in addition we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured in addition if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation and as more information is gathered and analyzed our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations including those that align to or are associated with the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting beps actions plans could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations 

our customers typically do not make longterm product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include longterm product purchase commitments in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on nonbinding forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further if orders or forecasts for products that 

meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and hindering our ability to recover our costs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the endproducts in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts semiconductor wafer foundry services assembly and test services and transportation among other things and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers and service providers including raw material and components suppliers semiconductor wafer foundries assembly and test contractors and freight carriers collectively vendors in manufacturing our products this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others these foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints with respect to tsmc in particular geopolitical changes in chinataiwan relations could disrupt tsmc’s operations which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products recently we have experienced increased demand leading to a constrained supply environment which we believe will continue in the near term in 

addition our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations in certain instances one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials if such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement vendors are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines thailand and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to the covid19 pandemic natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial automotive communications and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty indemnity andor product liability claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects including recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive including autonomous vehicles aerospace defense and healthcare where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures any product liability claim whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or 

compatibility problems not capable of being resolved our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results furthermore we market and sell our products through authorized thirdparty distributors and from time to time our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market” there is a risk that customers purchasing our products on the gray market may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products including products that have been altered mishandled or damaged or used products presented as new which could result in damage to property or persons and cause serious reputational harm 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our key personnel including our leadership team management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could also have a material adverse effect on our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons including difficulties in identifying potential targets the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

• diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses 

• difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations systems and infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses 

• strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations 

• the future funding requirements for acquired companies including research and development costs employee compensation and benefits and operating expenses which may be significant 

• servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions 

• potential loss of key employees 

• exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies 

• higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses 

• difficulty realizing expected cost savings operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and 

• increased risk of costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings 

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters in the locations in which we operate 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions earthquakes fires tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semiarid regions during 2021 the west coast of the us experienced historic wildfires where we have operations and manufacturing facilities the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors including our largest distributor and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

• global economic conditions generally 

• crises in global credit debt and financial markets 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 

• changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance 

• financial results and prospects of our customers 

• us and foreign government actions including with respect to trade travel export and taxation 

• changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies 

• rumors and speculation in the press investment community or on social media about us our customers or other companies in our industry 

• announcements by us our customers or our competitors of significant new products technical innovations material transactions acquisitions or dispositions litigation capital commitments including share repurchases and dividend policies or revised earnings estimates 

• departures of key personnel 

• alleged noncompliance with laws regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees officers or directors and 

• negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers customers or competitors 

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such purchases or sales securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result 

risks related to our indebtedness 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control for example the disruption to economic activity resulting from the covid19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have adverse effects on our supply chain manufacturing operations and facilities and workforce if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

• seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets 

• refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• borrow under our revolving credit facility 

• divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations 

• repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences or 

• sell selected assets 

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in our markets in addition our revolving credit facility require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable andor we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements information security practices and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information reverse engineer or copy our technologies products or processes or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property 

moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events due to the covid19 pandemic many of our employees and directors are temporarily working remotely which may pose additional data security risks we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers suppliers or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in particular climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us our suppliers and our customers such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

• liability for damages and remediation 

• the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines 

• the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products 

• changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available 

• damage to our reputation andor 

• increased expenses associated with compliance 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and shareholders 

while we are confident that our strategy and longterm contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of covid19 on our business the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain such as the continued duration and severity of the pandemic the spread of more contagious variants of the virus the adoption rate of vaccines the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume

overview 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 



 

1 the su m of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

revenue increased across all end markets in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher broadbased demand for our products sold into the automotive consumer and industrial end markets revenue in the communications end market was also slightly higher in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles in certain regions offset higher demand incremental revenue as a result of the acquisition also contributed to higher revenue in each end market in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 

revenue by sales channel 

the following table summarizes revenue by sales channel we sell our products globally through a direct sales force third party distributors independent sales representatives and via our website distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them direct customers are nondistributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers oems other customers include the us government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time 



 

1 the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand in fiscal 2021 higher demand within our automotive and industrial end markets resulted in increased revenue through our distributor channel 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the geographic location of the distributors or oems who purchased the companys products for fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was as follows 

 

1 the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

in all periods presented the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden and the netherlands and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan malaysia south korea and singapore 

total revenue increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to broadbased global demand in the semiconductor industry as well as the incremental impact of revenue from the acquisition we saw increases across all end markets in territories with the exception of sales into the communication end market in china which was impacted by infrastructure deployment cycles as noted above 

gross margin 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2021 decreased by 410 basis points compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of recording additional costs related to the acquisition including 3311 million and 1554 million of cost of goods sold related to the fair value adjustments recorded to inventory and amortization expense of intangible assets respectively these increases in cost of sales as a result of the acquisition were partially offset by the favorable impact of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand 

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher rd employeerelated variable compensation expense incremental rd expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition and higher salary and benefit expenses 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher costs due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs incremental smga expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition and higher variable compensation expense and salary and benefit expenses 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of 1058 million of amortization expense of intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition 

special charges net 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years 

closure of manufacturing facilities we recorded special charges as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of linear the special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with the companys ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations and onetime termination benefits for the impacted employees and other exit costs these onetime termination benefits are being recognized over the future service period required for employees to earn these benefits in addition as a result of managements plan to close certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of linear technology corporation linear the company sold its facility in singapore and ceased production at its hillview manufacturing facility in milpitas california during fiscal 2021 

repositioning actions in fiscal 2020 we recorded special charges of 494 million as a result of organizational initiatives to better align its global workforce with its longterm strategic plan the special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with the companys ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations and the writeoff of acquired intellectual property due to the companys decision to discontinue certain product development strategies 

other the other special charges of 834 million recognized during fiscal 2021 include severance and benefit costs as well as charges recorded from acceleration of equity awards in connection with the termination of a limited number of employees as part of the integration of the acquisition 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a 8345 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 2555 million increase in smga expenses a 2456 million increase in rd expenses a 1074 million increase in amortization expenses and a 321 million increase in special charges net as more fully described above under the headings gross margin selling marketing general and administrative smga research and development rd amortization of intangibles and special charges net  

nonoperating income expense 

the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to debt transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 partially offset by gains recorded on other investments and a decrease in interest expense related to our debt obligations in the period 

benefit from provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were below the us statutory rate of 21 due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income our provision for income taxes was 

impacted by incremental profit related to the acquisition additionally in fiscal 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of 1888 million from deferred tax assets related to an intraentity transfer of intangible assets for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland at a tax rate of 125 

our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items primarily related to 259 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the internal revenue service audit of linear’s preacquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of 162 million 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

net income 

the increase in net income in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was a result of a 1940 million increase in operating income and a 1526 million decrease in provision for income taxes resulting in a net income tax benefit partially offset by a 1769 million increase in nonoperating expense as more fully described above under the headings operating income  benefit from provision for income taxes and nonoperating income expense  

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 30 2021 our principal source of liquidity was 19780 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 8766 million was held in the united states and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by among other things reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the united states we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available short and longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 

a discussion of changes in our liquidity and capital resources from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for fiscal 2020 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 24 2020 the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of higher net income and an increase from changes in working capital net income in fiscal 2021 also included larger noncash expenses from the acquisition that were not included in fiscal 2020 

investing activities 

investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from or purchases of investments the increase in cash provided by used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of cash received from the acquisition partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in common stock repurchases in connection with our accelerated share repurchase program and higher dividend payments partially offset by a net increase in debt in fiscal 2021 as we terminated some debt and raised additional proceeds from debt compared to the net decrease in debt in 2020 

working capital 

 

1 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2021 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the writeup of fixed assets to fair value the calculations above include the financial results of maxim prospectively from the acquisition date 

the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of the acquisition as well as normal variations in the timing of collections and billings 

inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of the acquisition as well as our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the inventory values on the consolidated balance sheet were also impacted by additional costs related to the acquisition and the requirement to account for acquired inventory at fairvalue 

current liabilities increased to 27703 million at october 30 2021 from 13650 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to the acquisition including 5167 million of maxim debt obligations classified as current and 5849 million of accrued liabilities

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2s new accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have entered into a binding agreement 2 the performance obligations have been identified 3 the transaction price to the customer has been determined 4 the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the 

contract and 5 the performance obligations have been satisfied the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes in those instances we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed shipping costs are charged to selling marketing general and administrative expense as incurred sales taxes are excluded from revenue 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

performance obligations  substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation the sale of mixedsignal integrated circuit ic products such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer which occurs upon shipment or delivery unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues 

transaction price  the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return referred to as stock rotation price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on managements estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 

contract balances  accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment 

adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value when using the qualitative method we consider several factors including the following 

– the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment 

– the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors businesses 

– changes in the value of major us stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units 

– changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased and 

– whether there had been any significant increases to the weightedaverage cost of capital rates for each reporting unit which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach 

if we elect not to use this option or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to our total company market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all of our reporting units in all periods presented we concluded the reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes we assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods 

we account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the benefit from provision for income taxes line of the consolidated statements of income we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new guidance on legislative interpretations a change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the grantdate fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions are calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting for restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions this grantdate fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stockbased compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition if we determine that an award is unlikely to vest any previously recorded stockbased compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination the grant date fair value of restricted stock units or performancebased stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the monte carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 

the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straightline basis over the vesting period see note 2r stockbased compensation and note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stockbased compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to among other things contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage employment or employment benefits we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on the 5000 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of october 30 2021 our annual interest expense would change by approximately 50 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

in certain instances we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances as of october 30 2021 we had no outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as of october 31 2020 for each 100 basis point decrease in the tenyear us treasury rate the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would have changed by approximately 1020 million 

based on our marketable securities outstanding as of october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 our annual interest income would change by approximately 197 million and 106 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period if significant such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 30 2021 we had 68 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 71 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 395 million of losses and 185 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 30 2021 we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 30 2021 and october 31 2020 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales channel 

we sell our products globally to more than 125000 end customers through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50 countries outside north america we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we believe distributors provide a costeffective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services from time to time we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition 

these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order 

to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our revenue and customer concentration is set forth in note 2l concentrations of risk  note 2n revenue recognition  and note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

markets 

the breakdown of our annual revenue by end market is set out in the table below 



the sum of the individual percentages may not equal 100 due to rounding

see note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by end market 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries 

our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to a varying degree of seasonality historically sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

we believe that a number of factors should be used to assess future customer demand including backlog macroeconomic trends customer insights and current customer bookings as compared to billings booktobill ratio we define backlog to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks however backlog may be impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders in addition as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty while also allowing certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 

production resources 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler® isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts milpitas california camas washington and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually internally and the other half from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required in addition we operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in penang malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and singapore we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products if any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

patents and intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 31 2020 we held approximately 3629 us patents and approximately 693 nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2040 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

environmental health and safety compliance 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report 

risks related to the proposed acquisition of maxim integrated products inc 

our ability to complete the acquisition of maxim integrated products inc maxim is subject to various closing conditions including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition not to be completed 

on july 12 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement the merger agreement to acquire maxim an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixedsignal products and technologies the merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the merger agreement these closing conditions include among others the receipt of required approvals under certain foreign competition laws and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger no assurance can be given that the required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied and if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of such consents and approvals any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize or to be delayed in realizing some or all of the benefits that we and maxim expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame 

additionally either we or maxim may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances including among other reasons if the merger is not completed by july 12 2021 which date may be extended under certain circumstances under certain circumstances including if the proposed merger is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory clearances we may be required to pay maxim a termination fee of 8300 million 

we can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

the termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact our business 

if the merger is not completed for any reason our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger we would be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets including negative impacts on our stock price 

• we may experience negative reactions from our customers suppliers distributors and employees 

• we will be required to pay our costs relating to the merger such as financial advisory legal financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses whether or not the merger is completed 

• the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions the waiver of which is subject to maxim’s consent not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed may prevent us from taking certain actions during the pendency of the merger and 

• matters relating to the merger including integration planning require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management which could otherwise have been devoted to daytoday operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to our business 

in addition we could be subject to timeconsuming and costly litigation related to the merger for example as previously disclosed in august and september 2020 three lawsuits were filed against the company in connection with our proposed acquisition of maxim two of the lawsuits were brought by purported shareholders against the company and the members of our board of directors and the third lawsuit was brought by a purported shareholder of maxim against maxim the members of maxim’s board of directors the company and a subsidiary of the company in exchange for certain disclosures that we and maxim voluntarily made in current reports on form 8k filed on september 30 2020 plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits voluntarily dismissed their actions in their entirety with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only and without prejudice to any other members of any putative class 

from and after the date of the merger agreement and prior to completion of the merger the merger agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without maxim’s consent and requires that our business be conducted in the ordinary course in 

all material respects these restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our business or organizational structure or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 

whether or not the merger is completed the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

whether or not the merger is completed the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business specifically  

• our and maxim’s current and prospective employees will experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company which might adversely affect the two companies’ abilities to retain key managers and other employees 

• uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger may cause our and maxim’s customers suppliers distributors vendors strategic partners or others that deal with us or maxim to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or maxim make other decisions concerning us or maxim or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or maxim which could negatively affect our respective businesses 

• the merger agreement restricts us and our subsidiaries from taking specified actions during the pendency of the merger without maxim’s consent which may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may arise prior to the completion of the merger and 

• the attention of our and maxim’s management may be directed toward the completion of the merger 

we have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the merger and are subject to restrictions contained in the merger agreement on the conduct of our business if the merger is not completed we will have incurred significant costs including the diversion of management resources for which we will have received little or no benefit 

we will incur significant acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the maxim acquisition and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of maxim 

we have incurred and expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger these costs and expenses include fees paid to financial legal and accounting advisors facilities and systems consolidation costs severance and other potential employmentrelated costs including severance payments that may be made to certain maxim employees filing fees printing expenses and other related charges we will need to pay some of these costs regardless of whether the merger is completed 

the combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger the costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of maxim’s business although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs strategic benefits and additional income as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all we will bear many of these costs even if the merger is not completed while we have assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses 

combining our business with maxim’s may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and maxim’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate as independent public companies there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both 

companies the loss of customers the disruption of our maxim’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated the combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations and prior to the merger management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following 

• lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our andor maxims customers deciding not to do business with the combined company or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company 

• integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent highquality products and services especially in the covid19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations 

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger and 

• our andor maxims performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations 

any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues level of expenses and operating results of the combined company which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company 

in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized actual growth and cost savings if achieved may be lower than what we and maxim expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated if we and maxim are not able to adequately address integration challenges we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies 

the market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the maxim acquisition 

if the merger is consummated it is expected that we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock to former maxim stockholders former maxim stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they will receive in the merger and our shareholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger other maxim stockholders such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the merger such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock 

risks related to our global operations 

the extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 pandemic will adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have adversely impacted and are expected to further adversely impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant operations worldwide including in the united states the philippines ireland singapore malaysia china and india and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact and expected duration of such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel modifying employee work locations and canceling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers for example many of our employees are temporarily working remotely which may impact 

our business operations or customer relationships such actions may result in further disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing operations and facilities and workforce we cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and result in a global recession the covid19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which may adversely affect our and our customers’ and suppliers’ liquidity cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets as a result the continued spread of covid19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform including in making timely payments to us which could further adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business the degree to which the pandemic impacts our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the pandemic the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty including related to the covid19 pandemic trade and political disputes between the united states and china and the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers distributors or customers could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

• political legal and economic changes crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business including potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the united states and china the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union and the implementation of the united statesmexicocanada agreement 

• compliance requirements of us customs and export regulations including the export administration regulations and the international traffic and arms regulations 

• currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations including the potential impact of the transition from libor 

• trade policy commercial travel export or taxation disputes or restrictions government sanctions import or export tariffs changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the us government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business particularly in china 

• complex varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements particularly with respect to tax regulations price protection competition practices export control regulations and restrictions customs and tax requirements immigration antiboycott regulations data privacy intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance including the foreign corrupt practices act 

• economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the us and its allies 

• increased managerial complexities including different employment practices and labor issues 

• changes in immigration laws regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• natural disasters or public health emergencies such as the current covid19 pandemic 

• transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs 

• changes to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rates 

• fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs 

• greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and 

• costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans 

any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present within our business operations in china for example changes in uschina relations the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results for example the us government has recently expanded export restrictions that limit our ability to sell to certain chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies these restrictions may negatively impact demand for our products including by causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on us suppliers furthermore if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view us companies as unreliable we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions and our business could be materially harmed we are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in china and elsewhere 

in addition our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by chinas continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust cybersecurity and data protection the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights 

if we are unable to address our us cash requirements it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested we intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our us cash requirements we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our business industry and partners 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

• the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products 

• changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products andor for end products that incorporate our products 

• the timing delay reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory 

• our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products 

• our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits andor stock rotation rights 

• our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration 

• changes in geographic product or customer mix 

• changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states ireland or worldwide 

• the effects of issued threatened or retaliatory government sanctions trade barriers or economic restrictions changes in law regulations or other restrictions including executive orders and changes in import and export regulations including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies export classifications or duties and tariffs particularly with respect to china 

• the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products 

• pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures 

• fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity 

• the ability of our thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials products andor components 

• a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments including china 

• a decline in the us government defense budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities a prolonged us government shutdown or delays in contract awards 

• any significant decline in our backlog 

• our ability to recruit hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers 

• our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes 

• the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide including health insurance retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits 

• our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels 

• potential significant litigationrelated costs or product liability warranty andor indemnity claims including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers 

• the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels including with respect to costs associated with labor utilities transportation and raw materials 

• the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government environmental and social responsibility standards 

• new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices and 

• the effects of public health emergencies civil unrest natural disasters widespread travel disruptions security risks terrorist activities international conflicts and other events beyond our control 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october 31 2020 was below our us federal statutory rate of 21 this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide including our current transfer pricing appeal in ireland changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization 

of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits in addition we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured in addition if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation and as more information is gathered and analyzed our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations including those that align to or are associated with the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting beps actions plans could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations 

our customers typically do not make longterm product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include longterm product purchase commitments in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on nonbinding forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and hindering our ability to recover our costs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the endproducts in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states for further discussion of our competitors see part i item 1  business—competition of this annual report on form 10k competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts semiconductor wafer foundry services assembly and test services and transportation among other things and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers and service providers including raw material and components suppliers semiconductor wafer foundries assembly and test contractors and freight carriers collectively vendors in manufacturing our products this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others these foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in addition in certain instances one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials if such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement vendors are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to the covid19 pandemic natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial communications automotive and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets 

which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty indemnity andor product liability claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects including recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive including autonomous vehicles aerospace defense and healthcare where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures any product liability claim whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results furthermore we market and sell our products through authorized thirdparty distributors and from time to time our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market” there is a risk that customers purchasing our products on the gray market may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products including products that have been altered mishandled or damaged or used products presented as new which could result in damage to property or persons and cause serious reputational harm 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our key personnel including our leadership team management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could also have a material adverse effect on our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market 

coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons including difficulties in identifying potential targets the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

• diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses 

• difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations systems and infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses 

• strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations 

• the future funding requirements for acquired companies including research and development costs employee compensation and benefits and operating expenses which may be significant 

• servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions 

• potential loss of key employees 

• exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies 

• higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses 

• difficulty realizing expected cost savings operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and 

• increased risk of costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings 

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors including our largest distributor and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

• the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid19 outbreak 

• global economic conditions generally 

• crises in global credit debt and financial markets 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 

• changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance 

• financial results and prospects of our customers 

• us and foreign government actions including with respect to trade travel export and taxation 

• changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies 

• rumors and speculation in the press investment community or on social media about us our customers or other companies in our industry 

• announcements by us our customers or our competitors of significant new products technical innovations material transactions acquisitions or dispositions litigation capital commitments including share repurchases and dividend policies or revised earnings estimates 

• departures of key personnel 

• alleged noncompliance with laws regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees officers or directors and 

• negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers customers or competitors 

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such purchases or sales securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result 

risks related to our indebtedness 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control for example the disruption to economic activity resulting from the covid19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have adverse effects on our supply chain manufacturing operations and facilities and workforce if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

• seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets 

• refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• borrow under our revolving credit facility 

• divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations 

• repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences or 

• sell selected assets 

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in our markets in addition our revolving credit facility and term loan require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable andor we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements information security practices and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information reverse engineer or copy our technologies products or processes or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events due to the covid19 pandemic many of our employees and directors are temporarily working remotely which may pose additional data security risks we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers 

may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers suppliers or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

• liability for damages and remediation 

• the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines 

• the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products 

• changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available 

• damage to our reputation andor 

• increased expenses associated with compliance 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws 

such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue

impact of covid19 on our business 

the pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers we have significant operations worldwide including in the united states the philippines ireland singapore malaysia china and india each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our manufacturing operations and supply chain generally stabilized at normal levels but that could change in the future given that the covid19 situation remains dynamic 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and shareholders 

while we are confident that our strategy and longterm contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of covid19 on our business the degree to which covid19 impacts our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and we cannot provide assurance as to the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume

overview 



revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market

2 the su m of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding 

revenue decreased across all end markets in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 the revenue decreases in the automotive end market were more pronounced as this market was impacted by lower vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many of our customers were required to suspend their operations in response to shelter in place orders from governments around the world in response to the covid19 pandemic the revenue decreases in the consumer end market resulted from a broadbased decrease in demand for our products in this end market including lower demand for products used in portable consumer applications the decline in the communications end market was primarily the result of the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles and the ramp up of these cycles in certain regions during fiscal 2019 the percentage decline in our industrial end market was less than the overall percentage decline in total revenue as the broadbased weakness across many applications was offset by growth in the instrumentation test healthcare and energy sectors of this end market 

revenue by sales channel 

the following tables summarize revenue by sales channel we sell our products globally through a direct sales force third party distributors independent sales representatives and via our website distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them direct customers are nondistributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers oems other customers include the us government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time

as indicated in the above table the percentage of total revenue sold via each sales channel has remained relatively consistent in fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the geographic location of the distributors or oems who purchased the companys products for fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was as follows

in all periods presented the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden and the netherlands and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan malaysia south korea and singapore 

total revenue decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 however revenue in china increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the regions relatively quick recovery from covid19 related shutdowns as compared to other regions as well as increases in demand across our broad market customers and stable revenue in the communications end market attributable to the 5g ramp up 

the sales decrease in the united states yearoveryear in fiscal 2020 was most pronounced in the consumer end market the sales decrease in europe yearoveryear in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by products sold into the automotive and industrial end markets while demand for products sold into the communications end market was relatively flat the sales decrease in japan yearoveryear in fiscal 2020 was broadbased as all end markets decreased from fiscal 2019 the sales decrease in rest of asia yearoveryear in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in our communications revenue 

gross margin 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2020 decreased by 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of lower internal utilization of our factories due to decreased customer demand and temporary shutdowns at some of our manufacturing locations in response to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by a writedown of inventory in fiscal 2019 which did not repeat in fiscal 2020 

research and development rd 



rd expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of lower discretionary spending partially in response to uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic as well as lower rd employeerelated salary and benefit expenses and lower variable compensation expense 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 



smga expenses increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of a 400 million charitable contribution to the analog devices foundation made in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 201 million in acquisitionrelated transaction costs in connection with the proposed acquisition of maxim partially offset by lower discretionary spending in response to uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic lower smga employeerelated salary and benefit expense and lower variable compensation expense 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years 

repositioning actions as a result of organizational initiatives to better align our global workforce with our longterm strategic plan we recorded special charges of 494 million in fiscal 2020 the repositioning actions taken in fiscal 2020 are not expected to result in any future net annualized savings as the reduction in salary and benefits from workforce reductions will be redeployed to other areas of the business as part of the reorganizational initiative 

closure of manufacturing facilities as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of linear technology corporation linear we recorded special charges of 29 million in fiscal 2020 once fully implemented we expect that these actions will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 600 million 

operating income 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a 3233 million decrease in gross margin and an 118 million increase in smga expenses partially offset by a 798 million decrease in rd expenses and a 433 million decrease in special charges as more fully described above under the headings gross margin selling marketing general and administrative smga research and development rd and special charges  

nonoperating income expense 



the yearoveryear decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense related to our debt obligations 

provision for income taxes 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were below the us statutory rate of 21 due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income for fiscal 2020 our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland at a tax rate of 125 for fiscal 2019 our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland and singapore at tax rates ranging from 125 to 17 in these jurisdictions 

our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items primarily related to 259 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the internal revenue service audit of linear’s preacquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of 162 million 

the tax rate for fiscal 2019 includes a 172 million tax benefit from a voluntary accounting policy change in the statutory statements of a foreign subsidiary an 112 million tax benefit from an increase in tax credits upon filing our fiscal 2018 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of 287 million

net income 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was a result of a 2124 million decrease in operating income partially offset by a 383 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a 319 million decrease in provision for income taxes as more fully described above under the headings operating income  nonoperating income expense and provision for income taxes  

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 31 2020 our principal source of liquidity was 10559 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 2419 million was held in the united states and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by among other things reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the united states we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts transaction costs associated with our proposed acquisition of maxim and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months

the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 a discussion of changes in our liquidity and capital resources from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for fiscal 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 26 2019 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of lower net income adjusted for noncash items and a decrease from changes in working capital 

investing activities 

investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a net increase related to our debt instruments and a decrease in common stock repurchases partially offset by an increase in dividend payments and a decrease in net proceeds from employee stock plans 

working capital 



 

1 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively 

the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings 

inventory in dollars decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand 

current liabilities decreased to 13650 million at october 31 2020 from 15086 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in the current portion our debt partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities 

revolving credit facility 

on june 28 2019 we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders revolving credit agreement which further amended and restated our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated as of september 23 2016 the revolving credit agreement provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 125 billion expiring on june 28 2024 loans under the revolving credit agreement can be eurocurrency rate loans or base rate loans at our option each eurocurrency rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0690 and 1375 each base rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 000 and 0375 in december 2018 we borrowed 750 million under the previous revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements we repaid the 750 million plus interest of 02 million in january 2019 in march 2020 we borrowed 3500 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements we repaid the 3500 million plus interest of 06 million in april 2020 

as of october 31 2020 we have no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for a trailing twelvemonth period of not greater than 35 to 10 assuming we do not undertake any significant acquisitions mergers and other fundamental changes should such a change occur we may be authorized to increase the covenant to 40 to 10 as of october 31 2020 we were compliant with these covenants see note 13 revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revolving credit facility 

debt 

as of october 31 2020 we had 51 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt the indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of october 31 2020 we were compliant with these covenants see note 14 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 82 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 

as of october 31 2020 an additional 19 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock unitsawards or the exercise of stock options in march 2020 we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a result of the global macroeconomic environment that suspension continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 given the planned acquisition of maxim we reinstated the share repurchase program in november 2020 which is part of the fiscal year ending october 30 2021 future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position results of operations outlook liquidity and other factors we deem relevant 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1657 million in fiscal 2020 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 4 of fiscal 2021 revenue these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

analog devices foundation 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we contributed 335654 shares of our common stock to the analog devices foundation as of the date of the contribution the shares had a fair value of approximately 400 million this expense was recorded in smga in the consolidated statement of income 

dividends 

on november 23 2020 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 062 per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 15 2020 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 4 2020 and is expected to total approximately 2291 million we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations in specified periods as of october 31 2020 



 

1 tax obligation relates to the onetime tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018 see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

2 certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 

3 amounts primarily represent future fixed and noncancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses including the payments due within the next twelve months 

4 debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity 

5 these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highlycompensated employees and nonemployee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation the amount in the “more than 5 years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “more than 5 years” column of the table 

6 our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for the current fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels as of october 31 2020 our net liability related to our defined benefit plans was 792 million see note 11 retirement plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

as of october 31 2020 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 247 million which are included in noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 31 2020 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 31 2020 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2s new accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 asu 201602 asu 201602 requires a lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to historical practice the update states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a righttouse asset for the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating with classification affecting the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease the fasb has issued amendments and updates to the new standard including practical expedients to be used during adoption the company adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 under the modified retrospective approach as a result of the adoption of asu 201602 we changed our accounting policy for leases see note 9 leases  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details of the impact of this asu on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services as a result of the adoption of new revenue accounting rules in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we revised our revenue recognition policy we now recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services under this rule we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have entered into a binding agreement 2 the performance obligations have been identified 3 the transaction price to the customer has been determined 4 the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 the performance obligations have been satisfied the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes in those instances we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed shipping costs are charged to selling marketing general and administrative expense as incurred sales taxes are excluded from revenue 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

performance obligations  substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation the sale of mixedsignal integrated circuit ic products such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer which occurs upon shipment or delivery unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less as allowed under asu 201409 we have opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues 

transaction price  the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return referred to as stock rotation price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on managements estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 

contract balances  accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which we determined is consistent with our eight identified operating segments on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 2 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value when using the qualitative method we consider several factors including the following 

– the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment 

– the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors businesses 

– changes in the value of major us stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units 

– changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased and 

– whether there had been any significant increases to the weightedaverage cost of capital rates for each reporting unit which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach 

if we elect not to use this option or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to our total company market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

in fiscal 2019 we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for seven of our eight reporting units and the quantitative method for one reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we performed a quantitative assessment of one of our reporting units due to the macroeconomic climate at that time in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 2 2020 we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our reporting units in all periods presented we concluded the reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes we assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods 

we account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes line of the consolidated statements of income we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new guidance on legislative interpretations a change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straightline basis over the vesting period see note 2r stockbased compensation and note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stockbased compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to among other things contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage employment or employment benefits we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on the 9250 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of october 31 2020 our annual interest expense would change by approximately 93 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

in certain instances we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances as of october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 for each 100 basis point decrease in the tenyear us treasury rate the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would change by approximately 1020 million and 1000 million respectively 

based on our marketable securities outstanding as of october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 our annual interest income would change by approximately 106 million and 65 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period if significant such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 31 2020 we had 43 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 48 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 185 million of losses and 121 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 31 2020 we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 31 2020 and november 2 2019 



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50 countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 57 of our fiscal 2019 revenue from sales made to distributors we believe distributors provide a costeffective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services from time to time we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition 

these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor  additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n revenue recognition of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

our primary distributors are arrow electronics arrow and macnica inc macnica they like our other distributors are not end customers but rather serve as a channel of sale to many end users of our products revenue from products sold to arrow accounted for 30 28 and 14 of net revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively revenue from products sold to macnica accounted for 10 of net revenues in fiscal 2019 and less than 10 in other periods presented in fiscal 2017 sales to apple inc one of our end customers accounted for approximately 12 of net revenues no other single end customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 international sales accounted for approximately 66 63 and 60 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and are based on the geographic location of the distributors or oems who purchased our products see note 4 industry segment and geographic information of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our revenue by channel and end market 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler®isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts milpitas california camas washington and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required 

we operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in penang malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and singapore we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 275 million in fiscal 2019 compared with approximately 255 million in fiscal 2018 and 204 million in fiscal 2017 we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending october 31 2020 fiscal 2020 to be slightly below 4 of fiscal 2020 revenue 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products if any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was approximately 10 billion and 14 billion respectively however as explained below we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenue we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty in addition we allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

less than 5 of our fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions that may strengthen our business 

on march 10 2017 we completed the acquisition of linear the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately 158 billion consisting of 111 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 46 billion from the issuance of our common stock and 01 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees 

additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is set forth in note 6 acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems in all of our facilities are certified to iso 140012015 for environmental management and all of our facilities conform to iso 45001 for occupational health and safety we are a member of the responsible business alliance rba which was formerly known as the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding substance content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of november 2 2019 we employed approximately 16400 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report 

political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty including escalating trade disputes between the united states and china the united kingdoms pending withdrawal from the european union and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers distributors or customers could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

• political legal and economic changes crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business including potential macroeconomic weakness related to escalating trade disputes between the united states and china and the united kingdoms pending withdrawal from the european union 

• compliance requirements of us customs and export regulations including the export administration regulations ear and the international traffic and arms regulations itar 

• currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations including the potential impact of the transition from libor 

• trade policy commercial travel export or taxation disputes or restrictions government sanctions import or export tariffs changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the us government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business particularly in china 

• complex varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements particularly with respect to tax regulations price protection competition practices export control regulations and restrictions customs and tax requirements immigration antiboycott regulations data privacy intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance including the foreign corrupt practices act 

• economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the us and its allies 

• increased managerial complexities including different employment practices and labor issues 

• changes in immigration laws regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies 

• greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights 

• natural disasters or pandemics 

• transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs 

• changes to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rates 

• fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs 

• greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and 

• costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans 

any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present within our business operations in china for example changes in uschina relations the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results in addition our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by chinas continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust cybersecurity and data protection the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights 

at november 2 2019 our principal source of liquidity was 6483 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 2957 million was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

• the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products 

• changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products andor for end products that incorporate our products 

• the timing delay reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory 

• our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products 

• our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits andor stock rotation rights 

• our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration 

• changes in geographic product or customer mix 

• changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states ireland or worldwide 

• the effects of issued threatened or retaliatory government sanctions trade barriers or economic restrictions changes in law regulations or other restrictions including executive orders changes in import and export regulations export classifications or changes in duties and tariffs particularly with respect to china 

• the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products 

• pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures 

• fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity 

• the ability of our thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials products andor components 

• a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments including china 

• a decline in the us government defense budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities a prolonged us government shutdown or delays in contract awards 

• any significant decline in our backlog 

• our ability to recruit hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers 

• our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes 

• the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide including health insurance retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits 

• our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels 

• potential significant litigationrelated costs or product liability warranty andor indemnity claims including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers 

• the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels including with respect to costs associated with labor utilities transportation and raw materials 

• the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government environmental and social responsibility standards 

• new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices and 

• the effects of public health emergencies natural disasters widespread travel disruptions security risks terrorist activities international conflicts and other events beyond our control 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended november 2 2019 was below our us federal statutory rate of 21 it was also below our blended us federal statutory tax rate of 234 for the fiscal year ended november 3 2018 this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide including our current transfer pricing appeal in ireland changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits in addition we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured in addition if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

compliance with the tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax legislation and as more information is gathered and analyzed our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations including those that align to or are associated with the organization for economic cooperation and developments base erosion and profit shifting beps actions plans could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements information security practices and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information reverse engineer or copy our technologies products or processes or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information those third parties may nonetheless also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers suppliers or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

our customers typically do not make longterm product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include longterm product purchase commitments in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on nonbinding forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and hindering our ability to recover our costs as a result of lengthy manufacturing 

cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the endproducts in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on thirdparties for supply of raw materials and parts semiconductor wafer foundry services assembly and test services and transportation among other things and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers and service providers including raw material and components suppliers semiconductor wafer foundries assembly and test contractors and freight carriers collectively vendors in manufacturing our products this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and others these foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in addition in certain instances one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials if such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our 

customers if additional or replacement vendors are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

• seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets 

• refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• borrow under our revolving credit facility 

• divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations 

• repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences or 

• sell selected assets 

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial communications automotive and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty indemnity andor product liability claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer we invest significant resources in the 

testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects including recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive including autonomous vehicles aerospace defense and healthcare where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures any product liability claim whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business in addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our key personnel including our leadership team management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could also have a material adverse effect on our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons including difficulties in identifying potential targets the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

• diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses 

• difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations systems and infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses 

• strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations 

• the future funding requirements for acquired companies including research and development costs employee compensation and benefits and operating expenses which may be significant 

• servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions 

• potential loss of key employees 

• exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies 

• higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses 

• difficulty realizing expected cost savings operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and 

• increased risk of costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings 

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control arrow electronics is currently our largest distributor these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors including our largest distributor and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts 

receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources our operating results could be adversely affected 

effective november 4 2018 all distributor sales are recognized upon shipment to the distributor under accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 we are now required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contract with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

• liability for damages and remediation 

• the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines 

• the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products 

• changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available 

• damage to our reputation andor 

• increased expenses associated with compliance 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2019 decreased by 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of lower internal utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and a writedown of inventory primarily associated with a customer within our communications end market 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 increased by 790 basis points compared to fiscal 2017 primarily because fiscal 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of 3587 million related to the sale of acquired linear inventory written up to fair value additionally the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the acquisition and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to fixed assets as a result of a full year of expense for each related to the acquisition 

research and development rd 



rd expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreases in variable compensation expense and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 partially offset by increases in operational spending and rd employee and related benefit expenses 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to 

maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 



smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreases in variable compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs and one less week of operations in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 partially offset an increase in operational spending 

amortization of intangibles 



amortization expenses was relatively flat in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 as we did not have any significant acquisitions of intangible assets in fiscal 2019 intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years 

repositioning action during fiscal 2019 we recorded special charges of 881 million as a result of organizational initiatives to reposition our global workforce skill set to align with our longterm strategic plan approximately 739 million of these actions was for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with either our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements the remaining 142 million related to the writeoff of acquired intellectual property due to the company’s decision to discontinue certain product development strategies once fully implemented the repositioning actions are expected to result in net annualized cash savings of approximately 480 million 

closure of manufacturing facilities as a result of our fiscal 2018 decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition we recorded special charges of 76 million during fiscal 2019 totaling 520 million on a cumulative basis through november 2 2019 over the next one to three years we plan to close our hillview wafer fabrication facility located in milpitas california and our singapore test facility we intend to transfer hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries in addition we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our singapore facility to our facilities in penang malaysia and the philippines in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners the special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs we expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 600 million once fully implemented 

operating income

nonoperating income expenses 



the yearoveryear decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense including lower amortized finance fees which were accelerated as a result of principal repayments related to our previously outstanding 3year and 5year term loans partially offset by an increase in other net expenses resulting from the impairment of investments during fiscal 2019

provision for income taxes 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 contains significant changes to us tax law including lowering the us corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tax legislation during fiscal 2019 in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 118 

the tax rate for fiscal 2019 was below the us statutory tax rate of 21 partially due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions from which we earn income and tax incentives such as the foreign derived intangible income deduction and research and development tax credits these items are partially offset by the global intangible lowtax income gilti tax the tax rate for fiscal 2019 includes a 172 million tax benefit from a voluntary accounting policy change in the statutory statements of a foreign subsidiary an 112 million tax benefit from an increase in tax credits upon filing our fiscal 2018 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of 287 million 

similarly our tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our then blended us federal statutory tax rate of 234 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and 256 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitations in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a discrete tax benefit of 6370 million from remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 210 us federal statutory tax rate and a provisional estimate of 6910 million for the discrete tax charge from the tax legislation’s onetime transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings which is comprised of a 7550 million transitional tax less a deferred tax liability of 640 million that was recorded in prior years and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation payments of 262 million 

nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 759 of our total revenues for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 this revenue generated outside of the us results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the us in fiscal 2019 this was primarily in ireland and singapore at tax rates ranging from 125 to 17 and in fiscal 2018 this was primarily in bermuda ireland and singapore at tax rates ranging from 0 to 333 the impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 2429 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 211 for fiscal 2019 as compared to a benefit of approximately 4208 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 52 for fiscal 2018 our foreign effective tax rates for both periods are inclusive of certain nondeductible expenses which can result in tax rates higher than the applicable statutory tax rates in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events and acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments

net income 



 

1 balances have been restated to reflect the adoption of asu 201409 see note 2a principles of consolidation in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was a result of a 1890 million decrease in operating income partially offset by a 256 million decrease in provision for income taxes and a 194 million decrease in nonoperating expense 

the increase in net income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a 7368 million increase in operating income partially offset by a 190 million increase in provision for income taxes and a 163 increase in nonoperating expense 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

at november 2 2019 our principal source of liquidity was 6483 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 2957 million was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future if such funds are needed for us operations we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and us state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

on the acquisition date we entered into a 90day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 41 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2020 and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2022 during fiscal year 2019 we refinanced both term loans into one 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 125 billion due march 10 2022 as of november 2 2019 we have repaid 325 million of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan see note 13 revolving credit facility and note 14 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months

at november 2 2019 cash and cash equivalents totaled 6483 million the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended november 3 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 27 2018 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of changes in tax liabilities related to the onetime transition tax as a result of the tax legislation 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of decreased payments for acquisitions partially offset by increased capital spending 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt related to the june 2019 term loan agreement and a decrease in debt repayments partially offset by increases in stock repurchases and dividend payments

2 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively 

the decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings 

inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand 

current liabilities increased to 15 billion at november 2 2019 from 11 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily due to increases in the current portion of our debt and income taxes payable 

debt 

as of november 2 2019 we had 55 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following 

5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes 2023 notes 

on june 3 2013 we issued the 2023 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing december 1 2013

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 82 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 

in connection with the acquisition we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program on august 21 2018 we reinstated the share repurchase program and as of november 2 2019 we had repurchased a total of approximately 1544 million shares of its common stock for approximately 61 billion under this program an additional 21 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock unitsawards or the exercise of stock options 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 2754 million in fiscal 2019 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be slightly below 4 of 

fiscal 2020 revenue these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

dividends 

on november 25 2019 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 054 per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 17 2019 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 6 2019 and is expected to total approximately 1989 million we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 2 2019 



 

1 the tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 contains significant changes to us tax law including lowering the us corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we elected to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis 

2 certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 

3 debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity 

4 these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highlycompensated employees and nonemployee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation the amount in the “more than 5 years” column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the “more than 5 years” column of the table 

5 our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2019 the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 

as of november 2 2019 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 277 million which are included in noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 2 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of november 2 2019 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2s new accounting pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge 

of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services as a result of the adoption of new revenue accounting rules in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we revised our revenue recognition policy we now recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services under this rule we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 1 we have entered into a binding agreement 2 the performance obligations have been identified 3 the transaction price to the customer has been determined 4 the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 the performance obligations have been satisfied the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes in those instances we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed shipping costs are charged to selling marketing general and administrative expense as incurred sales taxes are excluded from revenue 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

performance obligations  substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation the sale of mixedsignal integrated circuit ic products such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer which occurs upon shipment or delivery unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less as allowed under asu 201409 we have opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues 

transaction price  the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return referred to as stock rotation price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on managements estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 

contract balances  accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component to date there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 4 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which we determined to be the same level as our eight identified operating segments on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 4 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value if we elect not to use this option or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

in fiscal 2017 and prior periods we did not elect to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2018 we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our reporting units 

in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 4 2019 we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for seven of our eight reporting units and the quantitative method for one reporting unit for each of the reporting units evaluated using the qualitative method we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values in making this determination we considered several factors including the following 

– the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment 

– the carrying values of these reporting units as of august 4 2019 compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis 

– public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors businesses such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired 

– changes in the value of major us stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units 

– changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased and 

– whether there had been any significant increases to the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc rates for each reporting unit which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach 

for the reporting unit we assessed goodwill using the quantitative method we calculated its fair value and compared it with its carrying value in calculating fair value we used a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we used a discounted cash flow methodology which required significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we used the guideline public company method under this method we utilized information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit to create valuation multiples that were applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit in order to obtain its fair value as a result of this analysis we concluded the reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying amount as of the assessment date and no risk of impairment existed 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

see note 12 income taxes of the of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straightline basis over the vesting period see note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stock based compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to among other things contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage employment or employment benefits we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case 

history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

during fiscal 2019 we entered into a term loan credit agreement under which we borrowed unsecured term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 125 billion maturing march 10 2022 loans under the term loan agreement may be eurodollar rate loans or base rate loans at our option each eurodollar rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted libo rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0625 and 1500 each base rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0000 and 0500 in fiscal 2019 we made principal payments on the term loans in the amount of 3250 million based on the 925 million of floating rate debt outstanding as of november 2 2019 our annual interest expense would change by approximately 93 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances as of november 2 2019 for each 100 basis point decrease in the tenyear us treasury rate the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would change by approximately 100 million 

based on our marketable securities outstanding as of november 2 2019 and november 3 2018 our annual interest income would change by approximately 65 million and 82 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of november 2 2019 and november 3 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period if significant such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of november 2 2019 we had 46 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 49 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of november 2 2019 and november 3 2018 assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 2 2019 and november 3 2018 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 121 million of losses and 141 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of november 2 2019 we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 2 2019 and november 3 2018 



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 56  of our fiscal 2018  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to us distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as 

determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n revenue recognition  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have over 125000 customers worldwide during fiscal 2018 no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of revenue apple inc represented approximately 14 and 12 of revenue in the fiscal year ended october 28 2017 fiscal 2017 and the fiscal year ended october 29 2016 fiscal 2016 respectively our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 33  of our fiscal 2018  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler®isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts milpitas california camas washington and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc global foundries vanguard and others typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required 

we operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in penang malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and singapore we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 255 million in fiscal 2018  compared with approximately 204 million in fiscal 2017  and 127 million in fiscal 2016  we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending november 2 2019  fiscal 2019  to be approximately 4 of fiscal 2019 revenue 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products if any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017 was approximately 12 billion we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is 

customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

less than 5 of our fiscal 2018  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions that may strengthen our business 

on march 10 2017 we completed the acquisition of linear the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately 158 billion consisting of 111 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 46 billion from the issuance of our common stock and 01 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees 

additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  is set forth in note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive 

towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems in all of our facilities are certified to iso 140012015 for environmental management and all of our facilities excluding certain linear facilities conform to ohsas 18001 for occupational health and safety we are a member of the responsible business alliance rba which was formerly known as the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of november 3 2018  we employed approximately 15800  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers distributors or customers could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 



 in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

our acquisition of linear technology corporation linear and the integration of its business operations and employees with our own may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized which could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

         we completed the acquisition of linear which we refer to as the acquisition on march 10 2017 the success of the acquisition including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate linears business into our business in an efficient and effective manner potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all and could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018  was below our blended us federal statutory rate of 234 calculated under the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 it was also below the us statutory tax rate of 35 for fiscal 2017 under the previous tax laws this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future 

effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide including our current transfer pricing appeal in ireland changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits in addition we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured in addition if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

           in addition any changes in tax legislation and further interpretation of certain aspects of the us tax legislation which become effective in the fiscal year ending november 2 2019 may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development an international association of thirtyfive countries including the united states ireland and uk released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties we continue to monitor these developments additionally as a result of the tax legislation described above we recorded provisional estimates of the onetime adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets liabilities and the deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits the final impact of the new tax legislation may differ from these estimates possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions made additional guidance that may be issued unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits and actions we take as a result of this new tax law 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted enforcement may not be available or achieved under the circumstances if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs 

which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes failure to obtain or maintain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining or maintaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product and could also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense some of our customers in new markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the products in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets additionally developing markets such as the industry 40 autonomous driving artificial intelligence and 5g require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may 

have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the us including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and wafer fabricators collectively suppliers to supply most of our products that can be manufactured using industrystandard processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due including the significant indebtedness that we have incurred in connection with the acquisition depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 



 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets 

our significant existing indebtedness could also have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes or creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial communications automotive and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed failures in our products and services or in the products of customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and could also adversely affect our operating results 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could 

be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results the inability to attract hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could also have a material adverse effect on our business in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract hire and retain qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect 

manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

 any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present in china while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to trade taxation import and export tariffs or restrictions currency controls antitrust cybersecurity and data protection the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies international trade policies and relations or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions by china in response to us actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

at november 3 2018  our principal source of liquidity was 8166 million  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 3835 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the tax legislation has on this indefinite 

reinvestment assertion as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected we have also recently reduced the number of distributors we use which may exacerbate the foregoing risks 

effective november 4 2018 all distributor sales will be recognized upon shipment to the distributor under accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 upon adoption of asu 201409 we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 increased expenses associated with compliance 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws in 

certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility term loans and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility term loans and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates and changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes the term loans or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 



 the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 increased by 840 basis points compared to fiscal 2017 primarily because fiscal 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of 3587 million related to the sale of acquired linear inventory written up to fair value additionally the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the acquisition and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to fixed assets as a result of a full year of expense for each related to the acquisition 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to acquisition accounting adjustments including 3587 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value 830 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and 229 million of depreciation related to fixed assets as a result of the acquisition the increases in cost of sales as a result of acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 approximately 1478 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of increases in operational spending and rd employee and related benefit expenses partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth the additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in operational spending and rd employee and related benefit expenses in fiscal 2018 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 approximately 2052 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in rd employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd 

projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a 555 million increase in smga expenses as a result of the acquisition partially offset by a decrease of 506 million in acquisitionrelated transaction costs which include legal accounting other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisition and acquisitionrelated costs approximately 1198 million of the total increase was a result of the acquisition acquisitionrelated costs which include legal accounting other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition increased 569 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the remainder of the increase in smga expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in smga employee and related benefit expenses

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded special charges of 445 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition over the next two to four years we plan to close our hillview wafer fabrication facility located in milpitas california and our singapore test facility we intend to transfer hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries in addition we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our singapore facility to our facilities in penang malaysia and the philippines in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners the special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs we expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 600 million once fully implemented 

special charges of 169 million 81 million and 137 million were recorded in fiscal 2018 fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively in an effort to reduce overall operating costs in addition in fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of 

413 million related to an early retirement offer action which we expect will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 284 million once fully implemented 

operating income

nonoperating income expense 



the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and an increase in interest expense related to financing commitments entered into in fiscal 2017 in connection with the acquisition and 750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the acquisition which terminated during fiscal 2017 

the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of 13 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 21 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition including a 90day bridge credit agreement in the principal amount of 41 billion a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

see note 14 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on debt issuances and commitments related to the acquisition 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 contains significant changes to us tax law including lowering the us corporate income tax rate to 210 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of november 3 2018 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax legislation however as described below we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax in fiscal 2018 

the tax legislation reduced the us statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 which results in a blended statutory income tax rate for us of 234 for fiscal 2018 for the fiscal year ending november 2 2019 fiscal 2019 our us federal statutory income tax rate will be 210 

the tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended us federal statutory tax rate of 234 for fiscal 2018 resulting from the passage of the tax legislation primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and 256 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitation similarly fiscal 2017 was below the then us statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of 505 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the us tax court’s favorable ruling offset by approximately 982 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the postacquisition integration 

in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a tax benefit of 6370 million from remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 210 us federal statutory tax rate fiscal 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of 6910 million for the discrete tax charge from the tax legislation’s onetime transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings which is comprised of a 7550 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of 640 million that was recorded in prior years 

additionally we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from sharebased payments of 262 million in fiscal 2018 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of 150 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the acquisition 

the tax legislation contains many provisions that are effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 because we are a fiscal year us taxpayer certain provisions such as the foreignderived intangible income deduction on certain foreignsource income and new limitations on certain business deductions will begin applying to us for our fiscal year ending november 2 2019 fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2018 the most significant impacts include a lower us federal corporate income tax rate a remeasurement of certain net deferred taxes to reflect the revised tax rates and a new transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings 

nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 759 of our total revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to approximately 773 of our total revenues fiscal 2017 this revenue generated outside of the us results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda ireland and singapore at tax rates ranging from 0 to 333 we have a partial tax holiday in malaysia through july 2025 a partial tax holiday in singapore had been in place through august 2019 but was terminated effective september 2018 due to negotiations with the economic development board the aggregate dollar benefits derived from these tax holidays approximated 277 million and 274 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2018 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by 007 each the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2017 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by 008 each the impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 4348 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 74 for fiscal 2018 compared to a benefit of approximately 3851 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 78 for fiscal 2017 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers our overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions 

where we earn income are lower than the us statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events and acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments 

see note 12 income taxes  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

net income 



the increase in net income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a 8266 million  increase in operating income partially offset by a 419 million  increase in provision for income taxes and a 166 million  increase in nonoperating expense 

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a 1555 million increase in nonoperating expense and a 60 million increase in provision for income taxes partially offset by a 270 million increase in operating income 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

at november 3 2018  our principal source of liquidity was 8166 million  of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 3835 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the tax legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future if such funds are needed for us operations we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and us state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

on the acquisition date we entered into a 90day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 41 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2020 and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2022 as of november 3 2018 we have paid 21 billion of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan paid 12 billion of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the 41 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement see note 13 revolving credit facility  and note 14 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at november 3 2018  cash and cash equivalents totaled 8166 million  the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in working capital primarily resulting from increases in tax liabilities related to the onetime transition tax recognized as a result of the tax legislation 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the postacquisition integration and other changes in working capital 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases maturities and sales of availableforsale securities as well as cash used for acquisitions 

the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities 

the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of cash payments made for the acquisition partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 

the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of 104 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments and lower repayments of principal on the 3year and 5year unsecured term loans 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of 99 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition consisting of a 90day bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement and a decrease in stock repurchases of 3235 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition these decreases were partially offset by payments of 51 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition 

working capital 



 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to fixed assets acquired fiscal 2017 also included cost of sales amounts for inventory acquired in the acquisition 

         the decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of the timing of shipments and the collection of receivables 

         inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand 

current liabilities decreased to 14 billion  at november 3 2018  from 16 billion  recorded at the end of fiscal 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt 

as of november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  we had gross deferred revenue of 6038 million  and 5895 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 1164 million  and 1155 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the distributors sales to their customers in fiscal 2018 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

debt 

as of november 3 2018  we had 63 billion  of carrying value outstanding on our longterm debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following

revolving credit facility 

we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on july 10 2020 the agreement for such revolving credit facility credit agreement provides that we may borrow up to 10 billion to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 45 to 10 the debt covenant will be reduced over time to 30 to 10 which began in may 2018 as of november 3 2018  we were compliant with these covenants  see note 13 revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revolving credit facility 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 82 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 

in connection with the acquisition we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program on august 21 2018 we reinstated the share repurchase program and as of november 3 2018  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1489 million  shares of its common stock for approximately 56 billion  under this program an additional 26 billion  remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock unitsawards or the exercise of stock options 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 2549 million  in fiscal 2018  and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 4 of fiscal 2019 revenue these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

dividends 

on november 19 2018  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 048  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 10 2018  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on november 29 2018  and is expected to total approximately 178 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 048 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 3 2018  



 

 as of november 3 2018  our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 168 million  which are included in noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 3 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of november 3 2018  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual 

report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

       in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations as amended asu 201409 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019 we are approaching the final stage of our project plan for the implementation of the guidance we have reviewed our revenue streams including those from the acquisition and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures including any impacts from recently issued amendments and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years the most significant impact of adopting the new standard will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors as described in note 2 revenue recognition  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers upon adoption of asu 201409 we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor we will adopt asu 201409 using the full retrospective method upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes which is upon shipment in the us and in certain foreign counties revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment accordingly we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed for multiple element arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous 

variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 

we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to us distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers as a result our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 5 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 5 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value if we elect not to use this option or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test in prior periods we did not elect 

to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis the goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 5 2018 we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our identified reporting units which we determined are the same as our eight operating segments for each of the reporting units we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values in making this determination we considered several factors including the following 

 business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

        the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax legislation significantly changes existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business see note 12 income taxes of the of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straightline basis over the vesting period see note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stock based compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from 

experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

         in the fiscal year ended october 28 2017 we borrowed 25 billion of 3year term loans and 25 billion of 5year term loans as part of the financing for the acquisition of linear technology corporation as of november 3 2018 we have paid 21 billion of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan and paid 12 billion of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan the term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the borrowing period plus the applicable spread 1125 basis points for the 3year term loan and 125 basis points for the 5year term loan based on the 18 billion of floating rate debt outstanding as of november 3 2018 of which 1 billion is hedged our annual interest expense would change by approximately 78 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  our annual interest income would change by approximately 82 million and 105 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio as of november 3 2018 and would result in a 70 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of october 28 2017 such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of november 3 2018  we had 46 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 45 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 141 million of losses and 101 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of november 3 2018  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 3 2018  and october 28 2017  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 28 2017  we held approximately 3255  us patents and approximately 801  nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2017 through 2037 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 50  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 53  of our fiscal 2017  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to us distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers  we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n revenue recognition  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of eight operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2017  we derived approximately 61  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2017  was as follow 



for further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us see the risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have over 125000 customers worldwide the companys largest single end customer apple inc represented approximately 14 12 and 13 of total revenue in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 35  of our fiscal 2017  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp and mixedsignal ics devices such as mems i coupler®isolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and cmos processes 

our ic products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in wilmington massachusetts milpitas california camas washington and limerick ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators we currently source approximately 45 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required 

we operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in malaysia and test facilities in the philippines and singapore we also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 204 million in fiscal 2017 compared with approximately 127 million in fiscal 2016 and 154 million in fiscal 2015 we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending november 3 2018 fiscal 2018 to be in the range of 230 million to 270 million 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2017  was approximately 12 billion  up  from approximately 700 million  at the end of fiscal 2016  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

less than 5 of our fiscal 2017  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

on march 10 2017 we completed the acquisition of linear the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately 158 billion consisting of 111 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 46 billion from the issuance of our common stock and 01 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees 

additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  is set forth in note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k there were no divestitures during any of the fiscal years presented 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems are certified to iso 14001 for environmental and conform to ohsas 18001 for occupational health and safety we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of october 28 2017  we employed approximately 15300  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development 

support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our acquisition of linear technology corporation linear and the integration of its business operations and employees with our own may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized which could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

         we completed the acquisition of linear which we refer to as the acquisition on march 10 2017 the success of the acquisition including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate linears business into our business in an efficient and effective manner potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all and could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 



 in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to 

lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed repatriation of nonus earnings any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits in addition we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia and a partial tax holiday in singapore through august 2019 the ability to extend such tax holidays beyond their date of expiration cannot be assured if we fail to meet certain conditions to the tax holidays we may lose the benefit of the tax holdings andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of thirtyfive countries including the united states ireland and uk released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties future tax reform resulting from such recommendations may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes failure to obtain or maintain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining or maintaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product and could also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense some of our customers in new markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the products in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets additionally developing markets such as the internet of things iot and autonomous driving require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we 

will achieve success in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the us including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for the iot market we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and wafer fabricators collectively suppliers to supply most of our products that can be manufactured using industrystandard processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 45 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes 

our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due including the significant indebtedness that we have incurred in connection with the acquisition depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 



 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results in addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms in the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will be dependent on the health of the debt capital markets 

our significant existing indebtedness could also have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes or creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial communications automotive and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed failures in our products and services or in the products of customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and could also adversely affect our operating results 

the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable 

this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if patents are granted enforcement may not be available or achieved under the circumstances if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events we also utilize external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology 

systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results the inability to attract and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy could also have a material adverse effect on our business in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland the philippines singapore and malaysia a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

 any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present in china while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs or restrictions currency controls antitrust cybersecurity and data protection the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies international trade policies and relations or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation and restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

at october 28 2017  our principal source of liquidity was 10 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 3792 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to 

our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected we have also recently reduced the number of distributors we use which may exacerbate the foregoing risks 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility term loans and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility term loans and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates and changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in 

addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes the term loans or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 



the industrial end market included 4897 million of revenue as a result of the acquisition in the fiscal year ended october 28 2017 fiscal 2017 industrial end market revenue increased yearoveryear primarily as a result of the acquisition and a broadbased increase in demand for our products in this end market the automotive end market included 1998 million of revenue as a result of the acquisition in fiscal 2017 automotive end market revenue increased yearoveryear primarily as a result of the acquisition and a broadbased increase in demand for our products the consumer end market included 362 million of revenue as a result of the acquisition in fiscal 2017 consumer end market revenue increased yearoveryear primarily as a result of an increased demand for products used in portable consumer applications and as a result of the acquisition the communications end market included 1876 million of revenue as a result of the acquisition in fiscal 2017 communications end market revenue increased yearoveryear primarily as a result of the acquisition 

automotive end market revenue increased yearoveryear in the fiscal year ended october 29 2016 fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased demand for our powertrain advanced driver assistance systems and infotainment products the yearoveryear decrease in the consumer end market in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of lower demand for products sold into portable consumer applications

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to acquisition accounting adjustments including 3587 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value 830 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and 229 million of depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value the increases in cost of sales as a result of 

acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 approximately 2052 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in rd employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in rd employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisition and acquisitionrelated costs approximately 1198 million of the total increase was a result of the acquisition acquisitionrelated costs which includes legal accounting and other related fees resulting from the acquisition increased 569 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the remainder of the increase in smga expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in smga employee and related benefit expenses 

smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreases in operational spending and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth partially offset by an increase in smga employee and related benefit expenses 

amortization of intangibles 



amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

early retirement offer action 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we initiated an early retirement offer this resulted in a special charge of approximately 413 million for severance related benefits and other costs in accordance with this program for 225 manufacturing engineering and smga employees as of october 28 2017  we still employed 26 of the 225 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits we expect this action will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 284 million once fully implemented 

reduction of operating costs action 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded special charges of approximately 81 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 177 manufacturing engineering and smga employees as of october 28 2017  we still employed 10 of the 177 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits we expect this action will result in estimated annual salary variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately 50 million once fully implemented 

during fiscal 2016 we recorded special charges of approximately 137 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 123  manufacturing engineering and smga employees as of october 28 2017  we still employed 23  of the 123  employees included in these cost reduction actions these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 

we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future 

other operating expense 

during fiscal 2015 we converted the benefits provided to participants in our irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our irish defined contribution plan retired pension plan participants received an annuity as a result in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges legal accounting and other professional fees totaling 2237 million to settle all existing and future irish pension plan liabilities 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of a 8344 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 3148 million  increase in rd expenses a 2296 million  increase in smga expenses a 2272 million  increase in amortization expenses and a 358 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings  research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga amortization of intangibles  and  special charges 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a 2237 million  decrease in other operating expense more fully described above under the heading other operating expense partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage 

nonoperating income expense 



the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of 13 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and 21 billion  of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition including a 90day bridge credit agreement in the principal amount of 41 billion a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion see note 16 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the debt issuances and commitments related to the acquisition the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2016 and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the acquisition these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the 3750 million  aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes the 2016 notes in fiscal 2016 see note 16 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information for further information on the issuance and redemption of these notes the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events 

the tax rate for fiscal 2017 is below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of 505 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the us tax court’s favorable ruling offset by approximately 982 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the postacquisition integration see note 14 income taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the us tax court ruling the tax rate for all other periods presented was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income for example the company has a partial tax holiday in singapore through august 2019 and a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 78 in fiscal 2017 compared to a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 61 in fiscal 2016 additionally our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of approximately 150 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the acquisition our effective tax rate for the fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of 75 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2015 retroactive to january 1 2015 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of 130 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities a tax benefit of 70 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1 2014 and a tax benefit of 38 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included 20 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the us provision to return adjustments 

nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 773 of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 compared to approximately 777 of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 and 780 of our total revenues for fiscal 2015 this revenue generated outside of the us results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at tax rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our effective tax rate related to income earned in foreign jurisdictions was reduced for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of increased depreciation amortization and other expenses associated with linear operations which are within foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates a change in the mix of revenue and income earned in the us and outside of the us will have a direct impact on the overall effective tax rate in any given period 

net income 



the decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily a result of a 1555 million  increase in nonoperating expense and a 60 million  increase in provision for income taxes partially offset by a 270 million  increase in operating income 

the increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of a 1973 million  increase in operating income and a 180 million  decrease in provision for income taxes partially offset by a 505 million  increase in nonoperating expense 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 28 2017  our principal source of liquidity was 10 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 3792 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely the majority of cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends and principal and interest payments if these funds are needed for us operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states under current tax law we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less including money market funds we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk in connection with the accounting for the acquisition we recorded approximately 16 billion of cash and marketable securities from linear which was remitted from foreign jurisdictions as part of our postacquisition integration also as part of the postacquisition integration we remitted legacy cash held outside of the united states of approximately 36 billion the remittances resulted in approximately 982 million in net tax expense recorded in fiscal 2017 we currently intend to use significant amounts of our remaining cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states to finance obligations and current operations of our foreign businesses on the acquisition date we entered into a 90day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 41 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2020 and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2022 in fiscal 2017 we repaid 5500 million of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan repaid 4000 million of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the 41 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement in addition in fiscal 2016 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments from 7500 million to 10 billion at the closing of the acquisition see note 15 revolving credit facility  and note 16 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at october 28 2017  cash and cash equivalents totaled 10478 million  the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1267 million  in fiscal 2017  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the postacquisition integration and other changes in working capital 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases maturities and sales of availableforsale securities as well as cash used for acquisitions 

the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of cash payments made for the acquisition partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities 

the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of availableforsale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in property plant and equipment additions 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of 99 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition consisting of a 90day bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement and a decrease in stock repurchases of 3235 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition these decreases were partially offset by payments of 51 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition consisting of repayments of 5500 million of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan repayments of 4000 million of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan and repayment of the 41 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreementthe decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of 12 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 notes and 2045 notes partially offset by 3782 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 notes an increase in stock repurchases of 1431 million a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of 611 million payments of 334 million related to derivative instruments payments of 266 million in deferred financing fees related to the acquisition of linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of 221 million 

working capital 



 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2017 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write up of fixed assets to fair value 

the increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of the acquisition and to a lesser extent higher product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 

the increase in inventory in dollars was primarily the result of the acquisition and our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels 

current liabilities increased to 16 billion  at october 28 2017  from 7829 million  recorded at the end of fiscal 2016  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of our debt an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of the acquisition increases in accrued interest and accrued special charges an increase in accounts payable resulting from higher production volumes and the acquisition and an increase in deferred income on shipments made to distributors as more fully described below 

as of october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  we had gross deferred revenue of 5895 million  and 4323 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 1155 million  and 808 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the acquisition and higher demand for products sold into the channel sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors 

have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

debt 

as of october 28 2017  we had 79 billion  of carrying value outstanding on our longterm debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following 

5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes 2023 notes 

on june 3 2013 we issued the 2023 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing december 1 2013

50 billion aggregate principal term loans 

on the acquisition date we drew down on a 3year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2020 and a 5year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of 25 billion due march 10 2022 in fiscal 2017 we repaid 5500 million of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan and repaid 4000 million of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan 

revolving credit facility 

we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders the credit agreement that expires on july 10 2020 the credit agreement provides that we may borrow up to 10 billion to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 50 to 10 the debt covenant will be reduced over time to 30 to 10 starting in may 2018 as of october 28 2017  we were compliant with these covenants  see note 15 revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revolving credit facility 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004  in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 62 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have 

repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 28 2017  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1470 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 54 billion  under this program as of october 28 2017  an additional 7925 million  remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program while we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the longterm we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 2041 million  in fiscal 2017  and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending november 3 2018  fiscal 2018  to be in the range of 2300 million to 2700 million these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

dividends 

on november 20 2017  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 045  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 12 2017  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 1 2017  and is expected to total approximately 166 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 045 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 28 2017  



 

 certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations which could be up to 85 million  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 

as of october 28 2017  our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 496 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 28 2017  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 28 2017  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations as amended asu 201409 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 which is our first quarter of the fiscal year ending november 2 2019 fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period we have developed a project plan for the implementation of the guidance including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing measurement or presentation of revenue recognition we have reviewed our revenue streams and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard including any impacts from recently issued amendments and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years under the full retrospective transition method we have also made progress on our impact assessment of the acquisition while we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors as described in note 2n revenue recognition  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers upon adoption of asu 201409 we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor we are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of asu 201409 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we will adopt asu 201409 using the full retrospective method upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a 

material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes which is upon shipment in the us and in certain foreign counties revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment accordingly we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed for multiple element arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 

we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to us distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers as a result our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if the company terminates the relationship with the distributor given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of july 30 2017  we identified our reporting units to be our eight operating segments the goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting units fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit additionally we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to 

operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends as it relates to our marketbased restricted stock units we utilize the monte carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the marketbased restricted stock units granted the monte carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and the resulting fair value of the award we recognize the expense related to these on a straightline basis over the vesting period which is generally five years  for stock options and three years  for restricted stock units see note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stock based compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

in fiscal 2017 we borrowed 25 billion of 3year term loans 25 billion of 5year term loans and a 41 billion bridge loan as part of the financing for the acquisition during fiscal 2017 we repaid 5500 million of principal on the 3year unsecured term loan repaid 4000 million of principal on the 5year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the 41 billion of the bridge loan the term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the borrowing period plus the applicable spread 1125 basis points for the bridge loan and 3year term loan and 125 basis points for the 5year term loan based on the 41 billion of floating rate debt outstanding as of october 28 2017 our annual interest expense would change by approximately 237 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  our annual interest income would change by approximately 105 million and 41 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 01 million and 7 million decline respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 28 2017  we had 39 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding with a fair value of 40 billion the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk market risk and other factors generally the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the fair values of our notes as of october 28 2017  and october 29 2016 assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates are as follows 



foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i derivative and hedging agreements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 101 million of losses and 80 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 28 2017  we do not believe that there is significant risk 

of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 28 2017  and october 29 2016  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

research and development 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 654 million during fiscal 2016  on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 637 million  during the fiscal year ended october 31 2015  fiscal 2015  and approximately 560 million  during the fiscal year ended november 1 2014  fiscal 2014  

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technology platforms which include converters amplifiers and rf and microwave mems power management and dsp in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 29 2016  we held approximately 2440  us patents and approximately 537  nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2035 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 40  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 52  of our fiscal 2016  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n revenue recognition  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2016  we derived approximately 62  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2016  was as follow 



 the sum of the individual percentages does not equal 100 due to rounding 

for further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 industry segment and geographic information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us see the risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have over 100000 customers worldwide our largest single customer represented approximately 12 of fiscal 2016  revenue and 13 of fiscal 2015 revenue no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of fiscal 2014  revenue our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 39  of our fiscal 2016  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on 

our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we currently source approximately 60  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 127 million  in fiscal 2016  compared with approximately 154 million  in fiscal 2015  we expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending october 28 2017  fiscal 2017  to be in the range of 125 million to 145 million 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2016  was approximately 700 million    up   from approximately   626 million   at the end of fiscal   2015  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to   rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

less than 5 of our fiscal 2016  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

as noted above on july 26 2016 we entered into the merger agreement to acquire linear under the terms of the merger agreement linear stockholders will receive for each outstanding share of linear common stock 4600 in cash and 02321 of a share of the company’s common stock at the closing based on the number of outstanding shares of linear common stock as of july 26 2016 and the companys 5day volume weighted average price as of july 21 2016 the value of the total consideration to be paid by us is estimated to be approximately 148 billion  to be funded with the issuance of approximately 580 million  new shares of the company’s common stock and approximately 116 billion  of new short and longterm indebtedness the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including remaining required regulatory clearances 

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite microwave corporation hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion 

additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  is set forth in note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k there were no divestitures during any of the fiscal years presented 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our ehs management systems are certified to iso 14001 for environmental and ohsas 18001 for occupational health and safety we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent 

regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of october 29 2016  we employed approximately 10000  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

risks related to the proposed acquisition of linear technology corporation 

our ability to complete the acquisition of linear technology corporation linear is subject to various closing conditions including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition to be abandoned 

          we and linear must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities we have not yet obtained all regulatory consents and approvals required to complete the acquisition governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the acquisition even if these regulatory consents and approvals are obtained the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition including requiring significant divestitures or placing restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business which could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisition the merger agreement may require us to accept certain conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company if we agree to undertake divestitures or comply with operating restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the acquisition we may be less able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the business and results of operations of the combined company after the acquisition may be adversely affected if all required regulatory consents and approvals are not received or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement then neither we nor linear will be obligated to complete the acquisition under the merger agreement we could be required under certain circumstances to pay linear a termination fee of 700 million if such a termination fee is payable the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations the applicable waiting period for the acquisition under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended expired on october 19 2016 and as a result the acquisition has been cleared for us antitrust purposes in addition we have received clearances for the acquisition from antitrust regulators in germany japan and israel 

         we can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

we will incur significant acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the linear acquisition and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of linear 

          we expect to incur costs associated with combining our operations with linear’s operations as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the acquisition many of these costs will be borne by us even if the acquisition is not completed we will incur through completion of the acquisition and the combined company will incur following the completion of the acquisition substantial expenses in connection with integrating each company’s respective businesses policies procedures operations technologies and systems these integration expenses may result in significant charges taken against earnings by us prior to completion of the acquisition and by the combined company following the completion of the acquisition 

we will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the merger which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business and increase our interest expense 

            in connection with the planned acquisition we entered into a commitment letter dated as of july 26 2016 the “commitment letter” with jpmorgan chase bank na bank of america na merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated credit suisse ag and credit suisse securities usa llc which was subsequently joined on august 10 2016 by the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj ltd together the commitment parties pursuant to which the commitment parties committed to arrange and provide subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter a 364day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 75 billion and a 90day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 41 billion on september 23 2016 we entered into a term loan facility composed of a 25 billion threeyear unsecured term loan facility and 25 billion fiveyear unsecured term loan facility collectively the term loan facility and an amended and restated revolving credit agreement revolving credit facility which expires on july 10 2020 borrowings under the term loan facility are available upon consummation of the planned acquisition of linear additionally upon the consummation of the planned acquisition of linear the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility will increase from 750 million to 1 billion and certain other amendments to the revolving credit 

facility will become effective as a result of our entry into the term loan facility the commitments under the 364day senior unsecured bridge facility were reduced from 75 billion to 25 billion upon consummation of the merger our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control in addition the amount of cash required to make principal and interest payments on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the completion of the merger this increased indebtedness could also have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted 

the market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the linear acquisition 

           following the acquisition our shareholders and former linear stockholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities our current shareholders and the current linear stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which our or linear’s common stock is or was included if following the acquisition large amounts of our common stock are sold the price of our common stock could decline 

the pendency of the linear acquisition could adversely affect us 

         in connection with the pending acquisition some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions which could negatively impact revenues earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the acquisition is completed 

         following the linear acquisition the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and linear’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

         the acquisition involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies the combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations and prior to the acquisition management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 

any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all 

risks relating to the business 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access 

external financing sources on acceptable terms financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 



 in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate in 2016 was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed repatriation of nonus earnings any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of thirty four countries including the us and uk released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur 

significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product which could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense some of our customers in new markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the products in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets additionally developing markets such as the developing internet of things iot market require significant investments resources and technological advancement in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the us including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost in addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for the iot market we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and wafer fabricators collectively suppliers to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 60 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial communications infrastructure automotive and consumer if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are involved in frequent litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in addition investments in earlytolate stage private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment 

both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 



 any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present in china while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs or restrictions currency controls antitrust the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies international trade policies and relations or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation and restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

at october 29 2016 our principal source of liquidity was 41 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 7258 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals minerals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available damage to our reputation andor increased expenses associated with compliance each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes 

in june 2013 we issued in a public offering 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes in december 2015 we issued in a public offering 8500 million aggregate principal amount of 39 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2025 the 2025 notes and 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 53 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2045 the 2045 notes and together with the 2023 notes and the 2025 notes the notes our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and the notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing the notes the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do 

not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

overview 

proposed acquisition of linear technology corporation 

on july 26 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement the merger agreement to acquire linear technology corporation linear an independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits under the terms of the merger agreement linear stockholders will receive for each outstanding share of linear common stock 4600 in cash and 02321  of a share of our common stock at the closing based on the number of outstanding shares of linear common stock as of july 26 2016 and our 5day volume weighted average price as of july 21 2016 the value of the total consideration to be paid by us is estimated to be approximately 148 billion  on october 18 2016 linear stockholders approved the merger agreement as of october 29 2016 we had received antitrust clearance in the united states and germany subsequently we have also received antitrust clearances in japan and israel we currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year ended october 28 2017 fiscal 2017 subject to receipt of the remaining required regulatory clearances and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions contained in the merger agreement 

we intend to fund the acquisition with the issuance of approximately 580 million new shares of our common stock and approximately 116 billion of new short and longterm indebtedness the financing is supported by fully underwritten bridge financing commitments and is expected to consist of term loans and bonds see note 6 acquisitions  and note 16 debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

acquisition of hittite microwave corporation hittite 

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion the acquisition of hittite is referred to as the hittite acquisition see note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10k for further discussion related to the hittite acquisition 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 





automotive end market revenue increased yearoveryear in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased demand for our powertrain advanced driver assistance systems and infotainment products the yearoveryear decrease in the consumer end market in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of lower demand for products sold into portable consumer applications 

the yearoveryear increase in the industrial and communications end markets revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the hittite acquisition consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the primary location of our customers design activity for its products for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  was as follows 



in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are south korea and taiwan 

         on a regional basis the sales increase in china in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial communications and automotive end markets the sales decrease in japan in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in demand for our products in the industrial end market the sales decrease in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 in the united states was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in the consumer end markets 

the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the united states was primarily the result of increased demand for consumer products sold into the portable sector and the hittite acquisition the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in europe was primarily the result of the hittite acquisition partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in wireless base stations the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in japan was primarily a result of the hittite acquisition partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in china was primarily a result of the hittite acquisition the sales decrease in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the rest of asia was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in most end markets partially offset by the hittite acquisition 

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 decreased by 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of lower utilization rates in our manufacturing facilities partially offset by a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 increased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the impact of purchased inventory recognized in fiscal 2014 as a result of the hittite acquisition 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of increases in rd employee and related benefit expenses and operational spending partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the hittite acquisition variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and rd employee and related benefit expenses 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of decreases in operational spending and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth partially offset by an increase in smga employee and related benefit expenses 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth smga employee and related benefit expenses as well as operational spending resulting from the hittite acquisition these increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisitionrelated transition costs and other activity 

amortization of intangibles 



amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015 

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of acquired amortizable intangible assets from the hittite acquisition these intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

during fiscal 2016 we recorded a special charge of approximately 137 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with the companys ongoing benefit plan for 123 manufacturing engineering and smga employees as of october 29 2016  we still employed 44 of the 123 employees included in these cost reduction actions these employees must continue to be employed by the company until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 123 million once fully implemented 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded special charges of approximately 373 million  these special charges included 379 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 05 million  for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and 04 million  for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities we reversed approximately  14 million  of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013 primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 462 million 

we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future 

other operating expense 

         during fiscal 2015 we converted the benefits provided to participants in our irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our irish defined contribution plan retired pension plan participants received an annuity as a result in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges legal accounting and other professional fees totaling  2237 million  to settle all existing and future irish pension plan liabilities 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of a 2237 million  decrease in other operating expense more fully described above under the heading other operating expense partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 5703 million  a 190 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a 373 million decrease in special charges partially offset by a 2237 million  increase in other operating expense a 778 million  increase in rd expenses a 243 million  increase in smga expenses and a 623 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga amortization of intangibles special charges and other operating expense 

nonoperating income expense 



the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of 8500 million aggregate principal amount of 39 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2025 the 2025 notes and 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 53 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2045 the 2045 notes in fiscal 2016 and as a result of fees related to financing commitments entered into in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of linear these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of the 3750 million  aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes the 2016 notes in fiscal 2016 see note 16 debt  of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the issuance of the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes and redemption of the 2016 notes the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

the decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of the 90day term loan facility used to fund the hittite acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of lower cash balances throughout fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

the tax rate for all periods presented was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78 of our total revenues for the fiscal 2016 resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 2643 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 61 in fiscal 2016 compared to a benefit of approximately 1981 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 106 fiscal 2015 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the us 

statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of 75 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2015 retroactive to january 1 2015 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of 130 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities a tax benefit of 70 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1 2014 and a tax benefit of 38 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included 20 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the us provision to return adjustments 

nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78 of our total revenues for fiscal 2015 resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 1981 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 106 in fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of approximately 1793 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 77 in fiscal 2014 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the us statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of 130 million recorded from the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities a tax benefit of 70 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1 2014 and a tax benefit of 38 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included 20 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the us provision to return adjustments our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items 

net income 



the increase in net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of the 1973 million  increase in operating income and the 180 million  decrease in provision for income taxes partially offset by the 505 million  increase in nonoperating expense 

the increase in net income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of the 784 million  increase in operating income partially offset by the 132 million  increase in provision for income taxes 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

acquisitions 

on july 22 2014 we completed our acquisition of hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion  financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion we recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 14 billion  of goodwill and 6664 million  of intangible assets including 09 million of inprocess research and development intangible assets we recognized approximately 509 million  of transactionrelated costs including legal accounting severance debt financing interest and other related fees of which approximately 97 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and 412 million in fiscal 2014 these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within smga expenses as well as nonoperating expenses the hittite acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment we continue to operate and track our results in one  reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven  operating segments 

the following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the hittite acquisition and assumes that the hittite acquisition which closed on july 22 2014 was completed 

on november 4 2012 the first day of the company’s 2013 fiscal year the pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets transactionrelated costs increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property plant and equipment and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the hittite acquisition together with the consequential tax effects these pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the hittite acquisition actually taken place on november 4 2012 in addition these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the hittite acquisition including but not limited to revenue enhancements cost savings or operating synergies that the combined company may achieve as a result of the hittite acquisition 



liquidity and capital resources 

at october 29 2016  our principal source of liquidity was 41 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 7258 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely the majority of cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends principal and interest payments and common stock repurchases if these funds are needed for us operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds and such amounts could be material our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition including money market funds and our shortterm investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes bonds and bank time deposits we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

        in connection with our proposed acquisition of linear in fiscal 2016 we obtained bridge financing commitments and entered into a term loan facility consisting of a 3year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of 25 billion and a 5year unsecured term loan facility in the principal amount of 25 billion we expect to finance the proposed acquisition using both short and longterm indebtedness totaling approximately 116 billion in addition in fiscal 2016 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility to allow for the increase in the amount of commitments to 10 billion from 7500 million  subject to closing the acquisition of linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions during the period prior to closing we expect to incur fees and expenses related to the financing arrangements and the acquisition see note 16 debt  of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

        we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts and dividend payments if any in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at october 29 2016  cash and cash equivalents totaled 9211 million  the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 368 million  in fiscal 2016  

operating activities 

        cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

        the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income adjusted for noncash items changes in working capital included a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable more fully described below under the heading working capital 

investing activities 

         investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases maturities and sales of availableforsale securities as well as cash used for acquisitions 

  

         the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of availableforsale securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in property plant and equipment additions 

financing activities 

  

         financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders repurchases of common stock issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 

  

        the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to net proceeds of 12 billion received from the issuance of the 2025 notes and 2045 notes partially offset by 3782 million of payments for the redemption of our 2016 notes an increase in stock repurchases of 1431 million a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of 611 million payments of 334 million related to derivative instruments payments of 266 million in deferred financing fees related to the proposed acquisition of linear and an increase in dividend payments to shareholders of 221 million 

working capital 



 we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory respectively 

the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of an increase in average accounts receivable of 9 over the prior year 

inventory as of october 29 2016  decreased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand 

current liabilities decreased to 7829 million  at october 29 2016  from 11 billion  recorded at the end of fiscal 2015  the decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the 2016 notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 partially offset by 

an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below 

as of october 29 2016  and october 31 2015  we had gross deferred revenue of 4323 million  and 3799 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 808 million  and 798 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from 

their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 debt 

as of october 29 2016  we had 17322 million  of carrying value outstanding on our debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following 

         5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes 2023 notes 

        on june 3 2013 we issued the 2023 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing december 1 2013 

8500 million aggregate principal amount of 39 senior unsecured notes 2025 notes and 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 53 senior unsecured notes 2045 notes 

on december 14 2015 we issued the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 15 and december 15 of each year commencing june 15 2016 

the indentures governing the 2023 notes 2025 notes and 2045 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of october 29 2016  we were compliant with these covenants see note 16 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

revolving credit facility 

on july 10 2015 we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders the credit agreement dated as of december 19 2012 on september 23 2016 we subsequently amended and restated the credit agreement the credit agreement expires on july 10 2020 and provides that the company may borrow up to 7500 million  subject to closing the acquisition of linear and the satisfaction of certain other conditions the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility will increase to 10 billion from 7500 million  and the maximum covenant level will be temporally revised to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 30 to 10 as of october 29 2016  we were compliant with these covenants  see note 15 revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our revolving credit facility 

  

          stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004  in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 62 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 29 2016  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1470 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 54 billion  under this program as of october 29 2016  an additional 7925 million  worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units as a result of our proposed acquisition of linear we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program while we do not plan to resume share repurchases in the near term we expect to continue repurchasing our common stock over the longterm 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1274 million  in fiscal 2016  and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2017  to be in the range of 1250 million to 1450 million these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

dividends 

on november 21 2016  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 042  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 13 2016  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 2 2016  and is expected to total approximately 1294 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 042 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 29 2016  



 

 certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations which could be up to 85 million  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 

  

          the table above does not reflect future obligations related to the longterm financing we have not yet incurred but expect to incur in connection with our proposed acquisition of linear as these obligations will be contingent upon the closing of the acquisition these obligations consist of the expected issuance of approximately 116 billion in both short and longterm 

indebtedness plus the interest expense associated with them see note 16 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on the financing commitments 

as of october 29 2016  our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 817 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 29 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of october 29 2016  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  asu 201409 which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations as amended asu 201409 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period as described in note 2n revenue recognition  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10k we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers upon adoption of asu 201409 we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor we are continuing to evaluate the future impact and method of adoption of asu 201409 and related amendments on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we are considering early adoption of the new standard using the modified retrospective method in fiscal 2018 our ability to early adopt the standard is dependent on system readiness and the completion of the analysis necessary to meet the requirements under asu 201409 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes which is upon shipment in the us and for certain foreign counties revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment accordingly we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed for multiple element arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers as a result our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years 

except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of july 31 2016  we identified our reporting units to be our seven  operating segments the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches under the income approach we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues gross profit margins operating income margins working capital cash flow perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others for the market approach we use the guideline public company method under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested in order to obtain their respective fair values in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined as described above to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium if the carrying amount of a reporting unit calculated using the above approaches exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that reporting units goodwill 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends as it relates to our marketbased restricted stock units we utilize the monte carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the marketbased restricted stock units granted the monte carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and the resulting fair value of the award we recognize the expense related to these on a straightline basis over the vesting period which is generally five years  for stock options and three years  for restricted stock units see note 3 stockbased compensation and shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stock based compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss 

may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of october 29 2016  and october 31 2015  our annual interest income would change by approximately 41 million and 27 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 29 2016  and october 31 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 7 million and 5 million decline respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 29 2016  we had 17500 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 500 million of 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes 850 million of 39 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2025 the 2025 notes and 400 million of 53 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2045 the 2045 notes as of october 29 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 notes 2025 notes and 2045 notes outstanding by approximately 29 million 66 million and 58 million respectively 

foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 2016  and october 31 2015  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 8 million of losses and 8 million of gains respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 2016  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29 2016  and october 31 2015  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background 

semiconductor components are the electronic building blocks used in electronic systems and equipment these components are classified as either discrete devices such as individual transistors or ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics may be divided into two general categories digital and analog digital circuits such as memory devices and microprocessors generally process onoff electrical signals represented by binary digits “1” and “0” in contrast analog ics monitor condition amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties such as temperature pressure weight light sound or motion and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems analog ics also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems 

organizational structure 

     we are organized in two business groups the industrial and healthcare business group and the communications and automotive business group these two groups align our technology offerings with the predominant markets served in order to facilitate decision making throughout our organization the industrial and healthcare business group is responsible for the industrial healthcare and consumer markets and the precision converters highperformance linear and sensor technology areas the communications and automotive business group is responsible for the communications infrastructure and automotive electronics markets as well as the radio frequencymicrowave highspeed converters and digital signal processing technology areas our sales and marketing operations are integrated within these groups and are chartered with unifying the customer experience across direct distribution and digital channels manufacturing finance legal and human resources are managed as separate functional operations providing support across the company

see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by end market 

research and development 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 637 million during fiscal 2015  on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 560 million  during the fiscal year ended november 1 2014 fiscal 2014  and approximately 513 million  during the fiscal year ended november 2 2013 fiscal 2013  

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technology platforms which include converters amplifiers and rf and microwave mems power management and dsp in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 31 2015  we held approximately 2280  us patents and approximately 635  nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2015 through 2034 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 40  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications webinars social media and communities promotional and training videos direct mail programs technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish share and distribute technical content such as data sheets application guides and catalogs we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 50  of our fiscal 2015  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2015  we derived approximately 61  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2015  was as follow 



for further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us see the risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have over 100000 customers worldwide our largest single customer represented approximately 13 of fiscal 2015 revenue no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10  of fiscal 2014  or fiscal 2013  revenue our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 39  of our fiscal 2015  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we currently source approximately 60  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 154 million  in fiscal 2015  compared with approximately 178 million  in fiscal 2014  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016  to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2015  was approximately 626 million    up   from approximately   538 million   at the end of fiscal   2014  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to   rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

we estimate that approximately 3  of our fiscal 2015  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite microwave corporation hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion 

on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property at the closing 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  is set forth in note 6 and note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable 

environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of october 31 2015  we employed approximately 9700  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 11 

 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate in 2015 was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation including proposed revisions to irish tax laws or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed repatriation of nonus earnings any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes 

competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the products in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the united states many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the us including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition in addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 60 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and 

operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are involved in frequent litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or 

pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 15 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

 16 

any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of these risks are present in china while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls antitrust the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation and restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

at october 31 2015  our principal source of liquidity was 30 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 6578 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals minerals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available damage to our reputation andor increased expenses associated with compliance each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes 

in april 2011 we issued in a public offering 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 the 2016 notes in june 2013 we issued in a public offering 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes and together with the 2016 notes the notes our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and the notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indentures governing the notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

 18 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

overview 

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite microwave corporation hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion  financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion the acquisition of hittite is referred to as the acquisition see note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10k for further discussion related to the acquisition 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 





the yearoveryear increase in the industrial and communications end market revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the acquisition consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market 

the yeartoyear increase in communications end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increased wireless base station deployment activity and to a lesser extent an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition industrial end market revenue increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of an increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors and to a lesser extent an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition the yeartoyear increase in automotive end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles and higher demand for new vehicles the yeartoyear decrease in revenue in the consumer end market in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the primary location of our customers design activity for its products for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  was as follows 



in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are south korea and taiwan 

the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the united states was primarily the result of increased demand for consumer products sold into the portable sector and the acquisition the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in europe was primarily the result of the acquisition partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in wireless base stations the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in japan was primarily a result of the acquisition partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment the sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in china was primarily a result of the acquisition the sales decrease in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the rest of asia was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in most end markets partially offset by the acquisition 

on a regional basis the yearoveryear sales increases for fiscal 2014 in most regions were the result of an increase in demand in the communications industrial and automotive end markets and an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition partially offset by a lower demand for products used in consumer applications 

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 increased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of lower amortization expense of purchased inventory recognized in fiscal 2014 as a result of the acquisition 

gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of recording approximately 536 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the acquisition this expense was partially offset by the improved utilization levels in our manufacturing facilities and to a lesser extent a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold as a result of the acquisition 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the acquisition variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and rd employee and related benefit expenses 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth higher rd employee and related benefit expenses and a general increase in other operational spending approximately 150 million of the overall increase yearoveryear was a result of the acquisition 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth smga employee and related benefit expenses as well as operational spending resulting from the acquisition these increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisitionrelated transition costs and other activity 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs and other activity of approximately 333 million the remainder of the increases were primarily due to higher variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth higher smga employee and related benefit expenses as a result of an increased headcount attributable to the acquisition and to a lesser extent increases in other operational spending the increases in smga employee and related benefit expenses were partially offset by a lower stockbased compensation expense as fiscal 2013 included 63 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units following the death of the companys thenceo in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 

amortization of intangibles 

during fiscal 2015  we recognized approximately 883 million  of amortization expense within operating expense approximately 878 million of this expense related to the 6655 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition these intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

  

         during fiscal 2014 we recognized approximately 260 million of amortization expense within operating expenses of which approximately 259 million related to the 6655 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition these intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded special charges of approximately 373 million  these special charges included 379 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 05 million  for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and 04 million  for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities we reversed approximately  14 million  of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013 primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action we expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 462 million once fully implemented 

during fiscal 2013 we recorded special charges of approximately 298 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235  engineering and smga employees we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 326 million 

we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future 

other operating expense 

         during fiscal 2015 we converted the benefits provided to participants in our irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our irish defined contribution plan retired pension plan participants received an annuity as a result in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges legal accounting and other professional fees totaling  2237 million  to settle all existing and future irish pension plan liabilities 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 5703 million  a 190 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a 373 million decrease in special charges partially offset by a 2237 million  increase in other operating expense a 778 million  increase in rd expenses a 243 million  increase in smga expenses and a 623 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga amortization of intangibles special charges and other operating expense 

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 2311 million  which was offset by a 40 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage a 467 million increase in rd expenses a 584 million increase in smga expenses a 258 million increase in amortization of intangibles and a 75 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga amortization of intangibles and special charges 

nonoperating income expense 



the decrease in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of the 90day term loan facility used to fund the acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of lower cash balances throughout fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

the change in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of recognizing other income of 854 million from the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading divestitures partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 102 million in conjunction with the redemption of our 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources interest and fees related to the 90day term loan facility used to fund the acquisition caused our interest expense to increase yearoveryear from fiscal 2013 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

the tax rate for all periods presented was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income income from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 86 of our total revenues for fiscal 2015 resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 1981 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 106 in fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of approximately 1793 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 77 in fiscal 2014 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the us statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of 130 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities a tax benefit of 70 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2014 retroactive to january 1 2014 and a tax benefit of 38 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included 20 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the us provision to return adjustments our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items 

income from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78 of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 1793 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 77 in fiscal 2014 compared to a benefit of approximately 1623 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 100 for fiscal 2013 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the us statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items our 

effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3 due to 66 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities and a tax benefit of 63 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in january 2013 retroactive to january 1 2012 

net income 



the increase in net income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of the 784 million  increase in operating income partially offset by the 132 million  increase in provision for income taxes 

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily a result of the 854 million decrease in nonoperating income partially offset by the 418 million decrease in provision for income taxes 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

divestitures 

on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million  in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the writeoff of inventory fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction recorded a net gain of 854 million  in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013 the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it was not considered to be a component of the company per the applicable guidance 

acquisitions 

on july 22 2014 we completed our acquisition of hittite the acquisition a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion  financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion we recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 14 billion  of goodwill and 6664 million  of intangible assets including 09 million of inprocess research and development intangible assets we recognized approximately 509 million  of transactionrelated costs including legal accounting severance debt financing interest and other related fees of which approximately 97 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and 412 million in fiscal 2014 these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within smga expenses as well as nonoperating expenses the acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment we continue to operate and track our results in one  reportable segment based on the aggregation of six  operating segments 

the following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the acquisition and assumes that the acquisition which closed on july 22 2014 was completed on november 4 2012 the first day of the company’s 2013 fiscal year the pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets transactionrelated costs increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property plant and equipment and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the acquisition together with the consequential tax effects these pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually taken place on november 4 2012 in addition these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the acquisition including but not limited to revenue enhancements cost savings or operating synergies that the combined company may achieve as a result of the acquisition 



liquidity and capital resources 

at october 31 2015  our principal source of liquidity was 30 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 6578 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends and common stock repurchases if these funds are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition including money market funds and our shortterm investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes bonds and bank time deposits we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and repurchases of our stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at october 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents totaled 8844 million  the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 3151 million  in fiscal 2015 

operating activities 

during fiscal 2015 we generated cash from operating activities of 9078 million  an increase of 362 million  compared to the 8716 million  generated in fiscal 2014 results of operations after noncash adjustments to net income contributed 9178 million  compared to a contribution of 7266 million  in fiscal 2014 the contribution by results of operations was offset by changes in net cash inflows from working capital changes 

investing activities 

during fiscal 2015 cash used for investing activities included 1540 million  for property plant and equipment additions and 71 million  for payments for acquisitions we received 1522 million  in proceeds from the net sales of availableforsale short term investments and s 

financing activities 

during fiscal 2015 cash used for financing activities included proceeds of 1226 million  from employee stock option exercises we distributed 4911 million  to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid 2270 million  for the repurchase of 41 million shares of our common stock 

working capital 



the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 overall our days in sales outstanding remained consistent yearoveryear 

inventory as of october 31 2015  increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increased manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand days cost of sales in inventory increased from 115  days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to 121  days at the end of fiscal 2015 as a result of recognizing approximately 536 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the acquisition in fiscal 2014 

current liabilities increased to 11 billion  at october 31 2015  from 7091 million  recorded at the end of fiscal 2014 the increase was primarily the result of the classification of our 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior 

unsecured notes due april 15 2016 as current and to a lesser extent increases in accounts payable deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below and accrued liabilities these increases were partially offset by decreases in income taxes payable 

as of october 31 2015  and november 1 2014  we had gross deferred revenue of 3799 million  and 3497 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 798 million  and 713 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 debt 

as of october 31 2015  we had 8733 million  of carrying value outstanding on our debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following 

3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes 

on april 4 2011  we issued 3750 million  aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016  the 2016 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on april 15 and october 15 of each year commencing october 15 2011  

5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes 

on june 3 2013  we issued 5000 million  aggregate principal amount of 2875  senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023  the 2023 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing december 1 2013  

the indentures governing the 2016 notes and the 2023 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of october 31 2015  we were compliant with these covenants see note 16 

in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

revolving credit facility 

on july 10 2015 we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders the credit agreement dated as of december 19 2012 the credit agreement expires on july 10 2020 and provides that we may borrow up to 7500 million to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of not greater than 30 to 10 as of october 31 2015  we were compliant with these covenants  

  

         20 billion term loan facility 

on july 22 2014 we entered into a 90day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 20 billion with credit suisse ag as administrative agent and each lender from time to time party thereto the term loan agreement to finance the acquisition on august 29 2014 we repaid in full the outstanding principal balance due under the term loan agreement 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004  in the aggregate our board of directors have authorized us to repurchase 56 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 31 2015  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1407 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 50 billion  under this program as of october 31 2015  an additional 5445 million  worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 

capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1540 million  in fiscal 2015  and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016  to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

dividends 

on november 23 2015  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 040  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 15 2015  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 4 2015  and is expected to total approximately 1248 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 040 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 31 2015  



 

 certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations which could be up to 30 million  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 

as of october 31 2015  our total liabilities associated with deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions was 810 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 31 2015  

offbalance sheet financing 

as of october 31 2015  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements   of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year and as a result public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods therein which is the companys first quarter of fiscal 2019 early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes which is upon shipment in the us and for certain foreign counties revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment accordingly we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed for multiple element arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist we perform a qualitative assessment on its indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize into earnings any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment which occurred on august 2 2015 we identified our reporting units to be our six operating segments the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration 

over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options and marketbased restricted stock units we calculate the grantdate fair values of stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock 

option the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends as it relates to our marketbased restricted stock units we utilize the monte carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the marketbased restricted stock units granted the monte carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and the resulting fair value of the award we recognize the expense related to these on a straightline basis over the vesting period which is generally five years  for stock options and three years  for restricted stock units see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information related to stock based compensation 

contingencies 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of october 31 2015  and november 1 2014  our annual interest income would change by approximately 27 million and 29 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 31 2015  and november 1 2014  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 5 million and 7 million decline respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of october 31 2015  we had 875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 375 million 3 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 the 2016 notes and 500 million 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes as of october 31 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 notes outstanding by approximately 2 million as of october 31 2015  a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 notes by 32 million 

foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 31 2015  and november 1 2014  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 8 million of losses and 8 million of gains respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 31 2015  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 31 2015  and november 1 2014  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 40  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our website we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 55  of our fiscal 2014  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2014  we derived approximately 71  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2014  was as follow 



for further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us see the risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10  of fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  revenue these customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 4  of our fiscal 2014  revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 32  of our fiscal 2014  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we currently source approximately 50  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 178 million  in fiscal 2014  compared with approximately 123 million  in fiscal 2013  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2015  to be in the range of 150 million to 165 million of which approximately 20 million relates to new buildings we are constructing 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in 

manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2014  was approximately 538 million  up  from approximately 345 million  at the end of fiscal 2013  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

we estimate that approximately 3  of our fiscal 2014  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

      on september 19 2014 we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share capital of metroic limited metroic a developingstage startup company with five employees located in edinburgh uk the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled  47 million  which consisted of  23 million  in initial cash payments at closing an additional  05 million  holdback for postclosing working capital adjustments and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration of  19 million  in addition we may be obligated to pay up to an additional  22 million  in deferred compensation expense relating to future product development and sales through december 31 2018  

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite a company that designs and develops high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion 

on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property at the closing in addition we have agreed to provide invensense with various transition services subsequent to the closing we may receive additional cash payments not to exceed 700 million based on the achievement of certain revenue milestones through the first anniversary of the closing date as of november 1 2014 we did not achieve any of the revenue milestones and have not received and do not expect to receive any additional cash payments 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  is set forth in note 6 and note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of november 1 2014  we employed approximately 9600  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

      our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 11 

 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is also subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate in 2014 was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation including proposed revisions to irish tax laws or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed repatriation of nonus earnings any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

longterm contracts are not typical for us some contracts may be terminated for convenience of the customer and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands additionally our us government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which 

often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside the united states many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the us competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 50 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services additionally our recently acquired hittite business utilizes foundries that provide the advanced gallium arsenide or gaas processes that currently account for most of its wafer purchases the number of foundries that can provide the gaas process is limited and hittite is currently in the process of transitioning away from one of its principal gaas foundries if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are involved in frequent litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches in addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our thirdparty business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 15 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future risks associated with our international business operations include the following 

 any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  many of these risks are present in china while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations 

including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls the environment indigenous innovation and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation and restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

at november 1 2014  our principal source of liquidity was 29 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 8565 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current credit facility through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals minerals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available damage to our reputation andor increased expenses associated with compliance each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties 

some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors as a united states government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the federal acquisition regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change additionally the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract 

  

in connection with our united states government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws in certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal 

penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards if we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes 

in april 2011 we issued in a public offering 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 the 2016 notes in june 2013 we issued in a public offering 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes and together with the 2016 notes the notes our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including 

 18 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results 

our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result

tableend results of operations 

overview 

fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were 52week years fiscal 2012 was a 53week year the additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended february 4 2012 

on july 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of hittite microwave corporation hittite a company that designs and develops high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion  financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion the acquisition of hittite is referred to as the acquisition the results of operations of hittite from july 22 2014 the acquisition date are included in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2014 and accounted for approximately 3 of revenue see note 6 acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on from 10k for further discussion related to the acquisition 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market  and revenue trends by product type  

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 





  

the yeartoyear increase in communications end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increased wireless base station deployment activity and to a lesser extent an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition industrial end market revenue increased yearoveryear in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of an increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors and to a lesser extent an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition the yeartoyear increase in automotive end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles and higher demand for new vehicles the yeartoyear decrease in revenue in the consumer end market in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

the yeartoyear decrease in revenue in the industrial and consumer end markets in fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of a weak global economic environment and one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles 

revenue trends by product type 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 



 



the yeartoyear increase in total revenue in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was the result of improving demand across most product type categories and the result of the acquisition which was partially offset by declines in the other analog product category primarily as a result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

the yeartoyear decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and a broadbased decrease in demand across most product type categories 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the primary location of our customers design activity for its products for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  was as follows 



in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and south korea 

         on a regional basis the yearoveryear sales increases for fiscal 2014 in most regions were the result of an increase in demand in the communications industrial and automotive end markets and an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition partially offset by a lower demand for products used in consumer applications 

on a regional basis the yearoveryear sales declines in japan and rest of asia for fiscal 2013 were primarily the result of lower demand for products used in consumer applications the yearoveryear sales increase in china for fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial end market 

gross margin 



gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of recording approximately 536 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the acquisition this expense was partially offset by the improved utilization levels in our manufacturing facilities and to a lesser extent a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold as a result of the acquisition 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 decreased 20 basis points compared to fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a slight mix shift in favor of lower margin products being sold 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth higher rd employee and related benefit expenses and a general increase in other operational spending approximately 150 million of the overall increase yearoveryear was a result of the acquisition 

rd expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as increases in rd employee salary and benefit expenses and other operational spending were offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses increased yeartoyear as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs and other activity of approximately 333 million the remainder of the increases were primarily due to higher variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth higher smga employee and related benefit expenses as a result of an increased headcount attributable to the acquisition and to a lesser extent increases in other operational spending the increases in smga employee and related benefit expenses were partially offset by a lower stockbased compensation expense as fiscal 2013 included 63 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units following the death of the companys thenceo in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 

smga expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as decreases in smga employee salary and benefit expenses and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth were partially offset by increases in other operational spending in addition fiscal 2013 also included 63 million of stockbased compensation expense following the death of our ceo in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement 

amortization of intangibles 

during fiscal 2014 we recognized approximately 260 million  of amortization expense within operating expenses of which approximately 259 million related to the 6655 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitionthese amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

during fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011 we recorded special charges of approximately 455 million  these special charges included 413 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245  manufacturing employees and 495  engineering and smga employees 21 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 08 million  for the writeoff of property plant and equipment 05 million  for contract termination costs and 03 million  for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred and 05 million  related to the impairment of intellectual property this action resulted in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 560 million we have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions 

during fiscal 2012 we recorded special charges of approximately 84 million  these special charges included 79 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 02 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 01 million  for contract termination costs and 02 million  for the 

writeoff of property plant and equipment these actions resulted in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 120 million  we have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions 

          during fiscal 2013  we recorded special charges of approximately 298 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235  engineering and smga employees as of november 1 2014  the company still employed 2  of the 235  employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by the company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 326 million 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded special charges of approximately 373 million  these special charges included 379 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 05 million  for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and 04 million  for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities we reversed approximately  14 million  of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013 primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates as of november 1 2014  the company still employed 311  of the 341  employees included in these cost reduction actions these employees must continue to be employed by the company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect these actions will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately 462 million once fully implemented 

we expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future 

operating income 

the yearoveryear decrease in operating income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 2311 million  which was offset by a 40 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage a 467 million increase in rd expenses a 584 million  increase in smga expenses a 258 million increase in amortization of intangibles and a 75 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings research and development rd selling marketing general and administrative smga amortization of intangibles and special charges 

the yearoveryear decrease in operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 675 million  a 20 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of 214 million in special charges as more fully described above under the heading special charges 

nonoperating income expense 



the yearover year change in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of recognizing other income of 854 million  from the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading divestitures partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 102 million in conjunction with the redemption of our 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources interest and fees related to the 90day term loan facility used to fund the acquisition caused our interest expense to increase yearoveryear from fiscal 2013 

the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of recognizing a gain of 854 million  from the sale of a product line as more fully described below under the heading divestitures  partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 102 million in conjunction with the redemption of our 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

the tax rate for all periods presented was below the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income income from nonus jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78 of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the us primarily in bermuda and ireland at rates ranging from 0 to 35 the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the us statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 1793 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 87 in fiscal 2014 compared to a benefit of approximately 1623 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 114 for fiscal 2013 a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the us statutory rate in addition our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3 due to 66 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities and a tax benefit of 63 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in january 2013 retroactive to january 1 2012 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result of an international tax restructuring effective january 1 2013 in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3 as a result of various discrete items including the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit and the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities these decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by the recording of a tax reserve of 365 million related to one open tax matter related to section 965 of the internal revenue code which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 5 and the tax effect of the gain on the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013 which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 

net income 



the yearoveryear decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 was primarily a result of the 854 million  decrease in nonoperating income partially offset by the 418 million  decrease in provision for income taxes 

the yearoveryear increase in net income in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of the lower provision for income taxes and the 728 million  increase in nonoperating income partially offset by the 710 million  decrease in operating income 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

      divestitures 

          on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million  in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the writeoff of inventory fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction recorded a net gain of 854 million  in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013 we have agreed to provide invensense with various transition services subsequent to the closing the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it was not considered to be a component of the company per the applicable guidance 

       acquisitions 

on july 22 2014 we completed our acquisition of hittite the acquisition a company that designs and develops high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications the total consideration paid to acquire hittite was approximately 24 billion  financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion we recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 14 billion  of goodwill and 6664 million  of intangible assets including 09 million of inprocess research and development intangible assets we recognized approximately 412 million  of transactionrelated costs including legal accounting severance debt financing interest and other related fees that were expensed in fiscal 2014 these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within smga expenses as well as nonoperating expenses this acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment we continue to operate and track our results in one  reportable segment based on the aggregation of six  operating segments 

the following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the acquisition and assumes that the acquisition which closed on july 22 2014 was completed on november 4 2012 the first day of the company’s 2013 fiscal year the pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets transactionrelated costs increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property plant and equipment and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the acquisition together with the consequential tax effects these pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually taken place on november 4 2012 in addition these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the acquisition including but not limited to revenue enhancements cost savings or operating synergies that the combined company may achieve as a result of the acquisition 



liquidity and capital resources 

at november 1 2014  our principal source of liquidity was 29 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 8565 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to 

reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends and common stock repurchases if these funds are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the united states the company would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition including money market funds and our shortterm investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes bonds and bank time deposits we 

maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and repurchases of our stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at november 1 2014  cash and cash equivalents totaled 5692 million  the following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1771 million  in fiscal 2014 

operating activities 

         during fiscal 2014 we generated cash from operating activities of 8716 million  a decrease of 407 million  compared to the 9123 million  generated in fiscal 2013 results of operations after noncash adjustments to net income contributed 7392 million compared to a contribution of 7315 million for the year ended november 2 2013 the contribution by results of operations was offset by changes in net cash inflows from working capital changes 

investing activities 

          during fiscal 2014 cash used for investing activities included 19 billion  of cash payments net of cash acquired in connection with the acquisition 20 billion  for the net purchases of availableforsale short term investments and 1779 million  for property plant and equipment additions 

financing activities 

         during fiscal 2014 cash used for financing activities included proceeds of 2001 million  from employee stock option exercises we distributed 4542 million  to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid 3563 million  for the repurchase of 72 million shares of our common stock 

working capital 

  

 

the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of accounts receivable acquired as part of the acquisition and higher product shipments in the final month of fiscal 2014 as compared to the final month of fiscal 2013 overall our days in sales outstanding remained consistent yearoveryear 

inventory as of november 1 2014 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of inventory acquired as part of the acquisition and increased manufacturing production to support anticipated higher 

sales demand our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand days cost of sales in inventory decreased from 111  days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 to 102  days at the end of fiscal 2014 as a result of recording approximately 536 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the acquisition we expect days cost of sales in inventory to return to normal levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

current liabilities increased to 7091 million  at november 1 2014  from 5705 million  recorded at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in accrued salaries benefits and severance including amounts related to the acquisition and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors more fully described below 

as of november 1 2014  and november 2 2013  we had gross deferred revenue of 3497 million  and 3092 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 713 million  and 618 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of higher demand for products as well as the acquisition and to a lesser extent a mix shift in favor of higher margin products sold into the channel sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 debt 

as of november 1 2014  we had 8728 million  of carrying value outstanding on our long term debt the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt our debt obligations consist of the following

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1779 million  in fiscal 2014 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of 150 million to 165 million of which approximately 20 million relates to new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations

 contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 1 2014  



 

 purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

our 2014 acquisition of metroic limited and our 2011 acquisition of lyric semiconductor inc involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations which could be up to 50 million  as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our acquisitions 

as of november 1 2014  our total liabilities associated with deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions was 706 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 1 2014  

offbalance sheet financing 

as of november 1 2014  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements   of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services additionally the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers asu 201409 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period which is the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 early application is not permitted the guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

revenue recognition 

revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes which is upon shipment in the us and for certain foreign counties shipments to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment accordingly we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed for multiple element arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendorspecific objective evidence nor thirdparty evidence is available a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 

revenue from contracts with the united states government government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of indirect costs the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract changes in contract performance estimated gross margin including the impact of final contract settlements and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist the company performs a qualitative assessment on its indefinitelived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value the company would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize into earnings any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment which occurred on august 3 2014 we identified our reporting units to be our six operating segments which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

business combinations 

under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations critical estimates in valuing purchased technology customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 44  to all unvested stockbased awards as of november 1 2014  this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

contingencies 

from time to time we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

postretirement benefits 

 we  have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates merit and promotion increases we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making our assumptions changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions our assumptions as to the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets historical longterm rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions the discount rate used for nonus plans reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on our annual measurement date which for fiscal 2014 was november 1 2014 and is subject to change each year 

the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment net actuarial gains or losses subject to amortization are amortized over the expected average remaining service lifetime to the extent that they exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and market related value of assets changes in pension incomecosts or assetsliabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values if the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions our benefit obligations may be overor undervalued see the disclosures about pension obligations the composition of plan assets assumptions and other matters in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

           we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm rate of return on assets which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic postretirement benefit cost the table below illustrates the impact of an increasedecrease of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended november 1 2014  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of november 1 2014  and november 2 2013  our annual interest income would change by approximately 29 million and 46 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of november 1 2014  and november 2 2013  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 7 million and 15 million decline respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of november 1 2014  we had 875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 375 million 3 senior unsecured notes the 2016 notes due april 15 2016 and 500 million 2875 senior unsecured notes the 2023 notes due june 1 2023 as of november 1 2014  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 notes outstanding by approximately 5 million as of november 1 2014  a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 notes by 35 million 

foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 1 2014  and november 2 2013  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately 8 million of gains and 2 million of losses respectively in changes in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of november 1 2014  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of 

the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 1 2014  and november 2 2013  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by category and end market 

research and development 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 513 million during fiscal 2013  on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 512 million  during fiscal 2012  and approximately 506 million  during fiscal 2011  

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters amplifiers and rf mems power management and dsp in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of november 2 2013  we held approximately 1950  us patents and approximately 700  nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2013 through 2033 there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 40  countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our website we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 55  of our fiscal 2013  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of five operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2013  we derived approximately 69  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2013 was as follow 



for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10  of fiscal year 2013  2012  or 2011  revenue these customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 4  of our fiscal 2013  revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 34  of our fiscal 2013  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we currently source approximately 50  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 123 million  in fiscal 2013  compared with approximately 132 million  in fiscal 2012  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 150 million of which about twothirds relates to ongoing capital spending and about onethird relates to capital spending for a new building we are constructing on our campus in ireland 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of 

components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2013  was approximately 345 million  down  from approximately 357 million  at the end of fiscal 2012  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

we estimate that approximately 3  of our fiscal 2013  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property at the closing in addition we have agreed to provide invensense with various transition services subsequent to the closing we may receive additional cash payments not to exceed 700 million based on the achievement of certain revenue milestones through the first anniversary of the closing date 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  is set forth in note 2u note 6 and note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of november 2 2013  we employed approximately 9100  individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities uncertainty regarding the future stability of the euro zone could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

      our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not 

experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside the united states many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve 

competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or 

lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 50 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation 

we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide for example in fiscal 2011 our revenue in japan declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country in addition flooding in thailand and the philippines in 2012 had disruptive effects on local semiconductorrelated businesses any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines approximately 69  of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products at november 2 2013  our principal source 

of liquidity was 46829 million  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 13189 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current credit facility through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection competition practices intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections we also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations indigenous innovation and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals minerals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages penalties and civil and criminal fines and might damage our reputation increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

compliance with new “conflict minerals” rules recently promulgated by the securities and exchange commission will result in increased costs related to investigations to determine the sources of raw materials used in our products and to any resulting changes to products processes or sources of supply the implementation of these rules could also adversely affect the 

sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations and the us congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future the us environmental protection agency epa has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations the epa is developing other climate changebased regulations as are certain states that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations additionally any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties civil and criminal fines suspension of or changes to production legal liability and damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes 

in april 2011 we issued in a public offering 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 the 2016 notes in june 2013 we issued in a public offering 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023 the 2023 notes and together with the 2016 notes the notes our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things 

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 17 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

overview 

fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 were 52week years fiscal 2012 was a 53week year the additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended february 4 2012 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market  and revenue trends by product type  

during fiscal 2013 our revenue decreased 2  compared to fiscal 2012 our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 214  in fiscal 2013 from 213  in fiscal 2012 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 was 9123 million  or 346  of revenue the yeartoyear decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and continued weakness in the global economic environment we believe that our variable cost structure and continued efforts to manage production inventory levels and expenses helped to mitigate the effect of the lower sales level on our earnings 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 





the yeartoyear decrease in revenue in the industrial and consumer end markets in fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of a weak global economic environment and one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 automotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles 

the yeartoyear decrease in revenue in the industrial consumer and communications end markets in fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a broadbased decrease in demand in these end markets a utomotive end market revenue increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles 

revenue trends by product type 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 



 



        the yeartoyear decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of one less week of operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and a broadbased decrease in demand across most product type categories 

         the yeartoyear decrease in total revenue in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was the result of a broadbased demand shift across all product categories 

revenue trends by geographic region 

revenue by geographic region based upon the primary location of our customers design activity for its products for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  was as follows 



in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and south korea 

on a regional basis the yearoveryear sales declines in japan and rest of asia for fiscal 2013 were primarily the result of lower demand for products used in consumer applications the yearoveryear sales increase in china for fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in demand in the industrial end market 

sales decreased in all regions in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of a broadbased decrease in demand 

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 decreased 20  basis points compared to fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a slight mix shift in favor of lower margin products being sold 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 decreased 190  basis points compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities as well as a reduced percentage of sales of our products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors of the industrial end market and the wireless base station sector of the communications end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end market sectors 

research and development rd 



rd expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as increases in rd employee salary and benefit expenses and other operational spending were offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and a general increase in spending partially offset by lower variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as decreases in smga employee salary and benefit expenses and variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth were partially offset by increases in other operational spending in addition fiscal 2013 also included 63 million of stockbased compensation expense following the death of our ceo in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement 

smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth was partially offset by annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

during fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 we recorded special charges of approximately 433 million  these special charges included 391 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245  manufacturing employees and 470  engineering and smga employees 21 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 08 million  for the writeoff of property plant and equipment 05 million  for contract termination costs and 03 million  for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred and 05 million  related to the impairment of intellectual property this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 520 million per year we have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions 

during fiscal 2011 we recorded a special charge of approximately 22 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25  engineering and smga employees this action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 40 million 

during fiscal 2012 we recorded special charges of approximately 84 million  the special charge included 79 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 01 million  for contract termination costs 02 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and 02 million  for the writeoff of property plant and equipment this action resulted in annual savings in smga expenses of approximately 120 million per year we have terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action 

during fiscal 2013 we recorded special charges of approximately 298 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235 engineering and smga employees as of november 2 2013 we employed 98 of the 235 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we estimate these actions will result in annual cost savings of approximately 326 million once fully implemented which will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future 

operating income from continuing operations 



the yearoveryear decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 675 million  a 20  basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of 214 million in special charges as more fully described above under the heading special charges 

the yearoveryear decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 2922 million and a 190 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage 

nonoperating income expense 



the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of recognizing a gain of 854 million  from the sale of a product line as more fully described below under the heading divestitures  partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 102 million in conjunction with the redemption of our 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 

the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of our issuance of 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes on april 4 2011 which was partially offset by the impact of the termination of our interest rate swap agreement more fully described below under the heading debt  the increases were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and an increase in nonoperating other income as a result of the gain from the sale of other investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result of an international tax restructuring effective january 1 2013 in addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3 as a result of various discrete items including the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit and the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities these decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by the recording of a tax reserve of 365 million related to one open tax matter related to section 965 of the internal revenue code which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 5 and the tax effect of the gain on the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013 which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 

the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the expiration of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2011 

income from continuing operations net of tax 



the yearoveryear increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was primarily a result of the lower provision for income taxes and the 728 million  increase in nonoperating income partially offset by the 710 million  decrease in operating income from continuing operations 

the yearoveryear decrease in net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of the 2480 million decrease in operating income from continuing operations partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2012 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

discontinued operations 



we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of this business has been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2011 additional proceeds of 100 million were released from escrow and 65 million net of tax was recorded as additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations 

      divestitures 

          on october 31 2013 we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to invensense inc invensense we received 1000 million  in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the writeoff of inventory fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction recorded a net gain of 854 million  in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013 we have agreed to provide invensense with various transition services subsequent to the closing we may receive additional cash payments not to exceed 700 million  based on the achievement of certain revenue milestones through the first anniversary of the closing date the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it did not meet the requirement to be considered a component of an entity 

acquisitions 

in fiscal 2012 we acquired privatelyheld multigig inc multigig of san jose california the acquisition of multigig is expected to enhance our clocking capabilities in standalone and embedded applications and strengthen our high speed signal processing solutions the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 268 million  which consisted of 242 million  in initial cash payments at closing and an additional 26 million  subject to an indemnification holdback that was payable within 15  months of the transaction date during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced this holdback amount by 01 million as a result of indemnification claims during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we paid the remaining 25 million due under the holdback our assessment of fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 156 million  of inprocess research and development iprd 11 million  of developed technology 70 million  of goodwill and 31 million  of net deferred tax assets the goodwill recognized is attributable to future technologies that have yet to be determined as well as the assembled workforce of multigig future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are a part of future development and growth of the business none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we finalized our purchase accounting for multigig which resulted in adjustments of 04 million  to deferred taxes and goodwill in addition we will be obligated to pay royalties to the multigig employees on revenue recognized from the sale of certain multigig products through the earlier of 5 years  or the aggregate maximum payment of 10 million  royalty payments to multigig employees require postacquisition services to be rendered and as such we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods as of november 2 2013  no  royalty payments have been made we recognized 05 million  of acquisitionrelated costs that were expensed in fiscal 2012 which were included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

in fiscal 2011 we acquired privatelyheld lyric semiconductor inc lyric of cambridge massachusetts the acquisition of lyric gives us the potential to achieve significant improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 278 million  which consisted of 140 million  in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to 138 million  the contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from june 2011 through june 2016  we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement utilizing the income approach changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date primarily driven by assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones will be recognized in operating income in the period of the estimated fair value change as of november 2 2013  the company had paid 80 million  in contingent consideration these payments are reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 122 million  of iprd 189 million  of goodwill and 33 million  of net deferred tax liabilities the goodwill recognized is attributable to future technologies that have yet to be determined as well as the assembled workforce of lyric future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are a part of future development and growth of the business none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was approximately 65 million  as of november 2 2013  of which 38 million  is included in accrued liabilities and 27 million  is included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in addition we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years  or the accrual of a maximum of 250 million  royalty payments to lyric employees require postacquisition services to be rendered and as such we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods as of november 2 2013  no royalty payments have been made we recognized 02 million  of acquisition related costs that were expensed in fiscal 2011 these costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

we have not provided pro forma results of operations for multigig and lyric herein as these acquisitions were not considered material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of each acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

at november 2 2013  our principal source of liquidity was 46829 million  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 13189 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to 

reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends and common stock repurchases our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition including money market 

funds and our shortterm investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes bonds and bank time deposits we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and repurchases of our stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at november 2 2013  cash and cash equivalents totaled 3921 million  the following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 1367 million  in fiscal 2013 

operating activities 

         during fiscal 2013 we generated cash from operating activities of 9123 million  an increase of 978 million compared to the 8145 million  generated in fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was related to higher net income adjusted for noncash items and the gain on the sale of the product line coupled with net cash inflows from working capital changes 

investing activities 

          during fiscal 2013 cash used for investing activities included 9187 million  for the net purchases of availableforsale short term investments 1231 million  for property plant and equipment additions and 1000 million  in proceeds from the sale of a product line 

financing activities 

         during fiscal 2013 cash used for financing activities included net proceeds of 4939 million  from the issuance of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes on june 3 2013 proceeds of 3063 million  from employee stock options and proceeds of 110 million  from the settlement of derivative instruments we paid 3928 million  related to the redemption of the 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes distributed 4060 million  to our shareholders in dividend payments paid 605 million  for the repurchase of 14 million shares of our common stock and repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on our 145 million term loan facility of 601 million  

working capital 

  

 

the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 days sales outstanding decreased as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

inventory as of november 2 2013  decreased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of our continued efforts to balance manufacturing production demand and inventory levels days cost of sales in inventory decreased from 114 days at the end of fiscal 2012 to 111 days at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of cost of sales decreasing 7 while inventory decreased by 10 for the same period 

current liabilities increased to 5705 million  at november 2 2013  from 5251 million  recorded at the end of fiscal 2012 as increases in income taxes payable accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors more fully described below were partially offset by a decrease in the current portion of long term debt 

as of november 2 2013  and november 3 2012  we had gross deferred revenue of 3092 million  and 2990 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 618 million  and 605 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products sold into the channel sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 debt 

as of november 2 2013  we had 8722 million  in principal outstanding on our long term debt our debt obligations consist of the following 

3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes 

on april 4 2011  we issued 3750 million  aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016  the 2016 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on april 15 and october 15 of each year commencing october 15 2011  

5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes 

on june 3 2013  we issued 5000 million  aggregate principal amount of 2875  senior unsecured notes due june 1 2023  the 2023 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing december 1 2013  

the indentures governing the 2016 notes and the 2023 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of november 2 2013  we were compliant with these covenants see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

revolving credit facility 

during december 2012 we terminated our 1650 million  unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders entered into in may 2008  on december 19 2012  we entered into a fiveyear  5000 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness in addition the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of not greater than 30 to 10  as of november 2 2013  we were compliant with these covenants  

1450 million term loan facility 

on december 22 2010 analog devices holdings bv our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with bank of america na london branch as administrative agent the borrowers obligations were guaranteed by us the credit agreement provided for a 1450 million term loan facility which was set to mature on december 22 2013 during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the loan of 601 million  and the credit agreement was terminated 

3750 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we redeemed our outstanding 50  senior unsecured notes which were due on july 1 2014  the 2014 notes the redemption price was 104744  of the principal amount of the 2014 notes we recognized a net loss on the debt extinguishment of approximately 102 million  recorded in other net expense within nonoperating income expense the loss was comprised of the makewhole premium of 178 million  paid to bondholders on the 2014 notes in accordance with the terms of the 2014 notes the recognition of the remaining 86 million  of unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap associated with the debt and the writeoff of approximately 10 million  of debt issuance and discount costs that remained to be amortized the writeoff of the remaining unamortized portion of debt issuance costs discount and swap proceeds are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities and the makewhole premium is reflected within financing activities 

stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004  in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 50 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of november 2 2013  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1301 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 44816 million  under this program as of november 2 2013  an additional 5184 million  worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 

         capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1231 million  in fiscal 2013 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 150 million of which about twothirds relates to ongoing capital spending and about onethird relates to capital spending for a new building we are constructing on our campus in ireland these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

         dividends 

on november 25 2013  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 034  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 17 2013  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 6 2013  and is expected to total approximately 1058 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 034 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

  

 contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 2 2013  



 

 purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

our 2011 acquisition of lyric semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our acquisitions 

as of november 2 2013  our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 713 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 2 2013  

offbalance sheet financing 

as of november 2 2013  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

outlook 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially as a result of among other things the important factors contained in part i item 1a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us 

we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be down approximately 5 to down approximately 10 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be approximately 64 to 65 we are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be approximately 226 million and our tax rate to be approximately 13 as a result our plan is for diluted eps to be approximately 044 to 052 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements   of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the 

amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist the impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on august 4 2013 we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

value of contingent consideration related to business combination 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 44  to all unvested stockbased awards as of november 2 2013 the rate of 44  represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

contingencies 

from time to time we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

postretirement benefits 

 we  have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates merit and promotion increases we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making our assumptions changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions our assumptions as to the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets historical longterm rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions the discount rate used for nonus plans reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on our annual measurement date november 2 and is subject to change each year the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment changes in pension incomecosts or assetsliabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values if the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions our benefit obligations may be overor undervalued see the disclosures about pension obligations the composition of plan assets assumptions and other matters in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

           we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm rate of return on assets which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic postretirement benefit cost the table below illustrates the impact of an increasedecrease of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended november 2 2013 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments and debt 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of november 2 2013  and november 3 2012  our annual interest income would change by approximately 46 million and 41 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of november 2 2013  and november 3 2012  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 15 million and 10 million decline respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of november 2 2013  we had 875 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 375 million 3 senior unsecured notes the 2016 notes due april 15 2016 and 500 million 2875 senior unsecured notes the 2023 notes due june 1 2023 as of november 2 2013  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 notes outstanding by approximately 9 million as of november 2 2013  a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 notes by 41 million 

foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 2 2013  and november 3 2012  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately 2 million and 1 million respectively in losses in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of november 2 2013  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 2 2013  and november 3 2012  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of analog’s disclosure controls and procedures as of november 2 2013  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of november 2 2013  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by category and end market 

research and development 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 512 million during fiscal 2012  on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 506 million  during fiscal 2011  and approximately 492 million  during fiscal 2010  

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters amplifiers and rf mems power management and dsp in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of november 3 2012  we held approximately 1900 us patents and approximately 700 nonprovisional pending us patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2012 through 2031 there can be no 

assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

sales channels 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website we have direct sales offices sales representatives andor distributors in over 40 countries outside north america 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our website we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products in addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers 

we derived approximately 55 of our fiscal 2012  revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

segment financial information and geographic information 

we operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of five operating segments 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2012  we derived approximately 70  of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

during fiscal year 2012  we revised our method for classifying revenue by geographic region to more accurately reflect the primary location of our customers design activity for our products in general the prior classification method reflected the customers manufacturing location or the distributors stocking territory no changes have been made to our revenue recognition policy a breakdown of our fiscal 2012  revenue by geographic location follows 



for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

customers 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of fiscal year 2012  2011  or 2010  revenue these customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 3 of our fiscal 2012  revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 33 of our fiscal 2012  revenue 

seasonality 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

production and raw materials 

monolithic ic components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we currently source approximately 50  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

capital spending was approximately 132 million  in fiscal 2012  compared with approximately 123 million  in fiscal 2011  we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately 90 million to 120 million in fiscal 2013   

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2012  was approximately 357 million down from approximately 379 million at the end of fiscal 2011  we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and 

have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2012  revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 



we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets 

environment health and safety 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

employees 

as of november 3 2012  we employed approximately 9200 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

there is significant uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets exacerbated by the ongoing european debt crisis these economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities uncertainty regarding the future stability of the euro zone could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

      our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stockbased compensation awards are less than those originally anticipated changes in available tax credits and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside the united states many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve 

competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we currently source approximately 50  of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc   in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our 

products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid from time to time we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property we may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches any such compromise of our information security could result in unauthorized access to our confidential business or proprietary information 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

       acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

we rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide for example our fiscal 2011 revenue in japan declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country in addition recent flooding in thailand and the philippines had disruptive effects on local semiconductorrelated businesses any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines approximately 70  of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products at november 3 2012  our principal source of liquidity was 39004 million  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 11058 million  was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current credit facility through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection competition practices intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections we also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations indigenous innovation and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials 

adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages penalties and civil and criminal fines and might damage our reputation increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations and the us congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future the 

us environmental protection agency epa has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations the epa is developing other climate changebased regulations as are certain states that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations additionally any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties civil and criminal fines suspension of or changes to production legal liability and damage to our reputation 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our two issuances of 3750 million senior unsecured notes or our 1450 million term loan facility 

in fiscal 2009 we issued in a public offering 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 in april 2011 we issued in a public offering 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 in december 2010 analog devices holdings bv a wholly owned subsidiary of ours entered into a 1450 million term loan facility which matures on december 22 2013 our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things 

 such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes or our term loan facility which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

restrictions in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our 50 and 30 senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our credit and term loan facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

our stock price may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

overview 

fiscal 2012 was a 53week year fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 52week years the additional week in fiscal 2012 was included in the first quarter ended february 4 2012 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market  and revenue trends by product type  

during fiscal 2012 our revenue decreased 10 compared to fiscal 2011 our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased to 213  in fiscal 2012 from 279  in fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 was 8145 million  or 302  of revenue during fiscal 2012 we received 1912 million  in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises repurchased a total of approximately 42 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 1605 million  distributed 3447 million  to our shareholders in dividend payments paid 565 million  in principal payments related to our 1450 million term loan facility paid 1322 million  for property plant and equipment additions and paid 242 million  net of cash acquired for the acquisition of multigig in addition we paid 11835 million  for the net purchase of short term availableforsale investments these factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 8763 million  in fiscal 2012 

the yeartoyear decrease in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of continued slowdown in the growth of the global economy our customers were increasingly cautious through the year and reduced the inventory levels of our products we believe that our variable cost structure and continued efforts to manage production inventory levels and expenses helped to mitigate the effect that these lower sales levels had on our earnings 

revenue trends by end market 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 



industrial —  the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased decrease in demand in this end market related to ongoing global macroeconomic weakness the yeartoyear decrease was most significant for products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and to a lesser extent products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors 

automotive  — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the electronic content in automobiles used in infotainment applications and to a lesser extent in power train and safety applications and a general increase in demand by our customers the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and to a lesser extent a general increase in demand by our customers 

consumer —  the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased decrease in demand for products sold in this end market the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march 2011 partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market 

communications —  the yeartoyear fluctuations in communications end market revenue for the years presented are primarily the result of broadbased demand shifts in this end market which were most significant for products sold into the wireless base station end market sector 

revenue trends by product type 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 



 



         the yeartoyear fluctuations in total revenue for the years presented were the result of a broadbased demand shift across all product categories 

revenue trends by geographic region 

during fiscal year 2012  we changed our method for classifying revenue by geographic region to more accurately reflect the primary location of our customers design activity for our products prior periods have been reclassified to align with this definition in general the prior classification method reflected the customers manufacturing location or the distributors stocking territory no changes have been made to our revenue recognition policy a breakdown of our fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  revenue by geographic location follows 



in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and south korea 

sales decreased in all regions in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of a broadbased decrease in demand 

sales increased in all geographic regions except japan and rest of asia in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of increases in sales activity in the industrial automotive and communications end market sectors the yeartoyear decrease in sales in japan and rest of asia was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march 2011 

gross margin 



gross margin percentage in fiscal 2012 decreased 190  basis points compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities as well as a reduced percentage of sales of our products sold into the industrial automation and instrumentation sectors of the industrial end market and the wireless base station sector of the communications end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end market sectors 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2011 increased 120 basis points compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of 2318 million increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions additionally a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets 

research and development rd 



rd expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and a general increase in spending partially offset by lower variable compensation expense which is linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased headcount and a general increase in spending these increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth we have hundreds of rd projects underway none of which we believe are material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth was partially offset by annual salary increases that became effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 

smga expenses increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased headcount and a general increase in spending these increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

special charges 

we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years the expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

we ceased production at our california wafer fabrication facility in november 2006 we paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term which expired in march 2010 we recorded a onetime settlement charge of 04 million  in fiscal 2010  related to the termination of the lease this action was completed during fiscal 2010  

reduction of operating costs 

during fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 we recorded special charges of approximately 433 million  these special charges included 391 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245  manufacturing employees and 470  engineering and smga employees 21 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 08 million  for the writeoff of property plant and equipment 05 million  for contract termination costs and 03 million  for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred and 05 million  related to the impairment of intellectual property this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 520 million per year we have terminated the employment of all employees associated with these actions 

during fiscal 2011  we recorded a special charge of approximately 22 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25  engineering and smga employees this action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 40 million 

during fiscal 2012  we recorded special charges of approximately 84 million  the special charge included 79 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 95  manufacturing engineering and smga employees 01 million  for contract termination costs 02 million  for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and 02 million  for the writeoff of property plant and equipment as of november 3 2012  we employed 6  of the 95  employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we estimate this action will result in annual savings in smga expenses of approximately 120 million once fully implemented 

closure of a wafer fabrication facility in cambridge 

during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we recorded special charges of 268 million  as a result of our decision to consolidate our cambridge massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing wilmington massachusetts facility these special charges included 74 million  for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124  manufacturing employees and 9  smga employees 146 million  for the impairment of manufacturing assets 34 million  for lease obligation costs for the cambridge wafer fabrication facility which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 14 million  for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred this action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 43 million per year 

operating income from continuing operations 



the yearoveryear decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 2922 million  and a 190  basis point decrease in gross margin percentage 

the increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 2318 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage 

nonoperating income expense 



the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of our issuance of 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes on april 4 2011 which was partially offset by the impact of the termination of our interest rate swap agreement more fully described below under the heading debt  the increases were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and the investment of higher cash balances in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and an increase in nonoperating other income as a result of the gain from the sale of other investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 

the yearoveryear increase in nonoperating expense income in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes on april 4 2011 and the 145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in december 2010 in addition we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 increased 100 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 due to the expiration of the us federal research and development tax credit in december 2011 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 decreased 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 due to the impact of several discrete tax items the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the reinstatement of the federal rd tax credit in december 2010 retroactive to january 1 2010 resulting in a 60 million income tax savings a 67 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve a 05 million tax benefit from the increase in irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the irish manufacturing tax rate from 10 to 125 and a net 108 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the appeals office of the internal revenue service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years 

income from continuing operations net of tax 



the yearoveryear decrease in net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 was primarily a result of the 2480 million  decrease in operating income from continuing operations offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2012 

net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was higher than in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of the 1720 million increase in operating income from continuing operations offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

discontinued operations 



we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions 

in fiscal 2012 we acquired privatelyheld multigig inc multigig of san jose california the acquisition of multigig is expected to enhance our clocking capabilities in standalone and embedded applications and strengthen our high speed signal processing solutions the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 268 million  which consisted of 242 million  in initial cash payments at closing and an additional 26 million  subject to an indemnification holdback that is payable within 15  months of the transaction date which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of november 3 2012  our assessment of fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 156 million  of inprocess research and development iprd 11 million  of developed technology 70 million  of goodwill and 31 million  of net deferred tax assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced the indemnification holdback amount by 01 million  as a result of indemnification claims during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  we finalized our purchase accounting for multigig which resulted in adjustments of 04 million  to deferred taxes and goodwill in addition we will be obligated to pay royalties to the multigig employees on revenue recognized from the sale of certain multigig products through the earlier of 5 years  or the aggregate maximum payment of 10 million  royalty payments to multigig employees require postacquisition services to be rendered and as such we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods as of november 3 2012  no  royalty payments have been made we recognized 05 million  of acquisitionrelated costs that were expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 which were included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

in fiscal 2011 we acquired privatelyheld lyric semiconductor inc lyric of cambridge massachusetts the acquisition of lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 278 million  which consisted of 140 million  in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to 138 million  the contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from june 2011 through june 2016  as of november 3 2012  we paid 20 million  in contingent consideration the payment is reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was approximately 122 million  of iprd as of november 3 2012  of which 68 million   is included in accrued liabilities and 54 million  is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 122 million  of inprocess research and development 189 million  of goodwill and 33 million  of net deferred tax liabilities in addition we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years  or the accrual of a maximum of 250 million  royalty payments to lyric employees require postacquisition services to be rendered and as such we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods as of november 3 2012  no royalty payments have been made we recognized 02 million  of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 these costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

we have not provided pro forma results of operations for multigig and lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

at november 3 2012  our principal source of liquidity was 39004 million  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 11058 million  was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to 

reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the united states including cash dividends and common stock repurchases our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition including money market funds and our shortterm investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes bonds and bank time deposits we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and repurchases of our stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 



at november 3 2012  cash and cash equivalents totaled 5288 million  the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2012 were net cash generated from operating activities of 8145 million  in addition we received 1912 million  in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises the principal uses of funds for fiscal 2012 were the repurchase of approximately 42 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 1605 million  dividend payments of 3447 million  principal payments of 565 million  related to our 145 million term loan facility additions to property plant and equipment of 1322 million  and payments of 242 million  net of cash acquired for the acquisition of multigig in addition we paid 11835 million  for the net purchase of short term availableforsale investments these factors contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 8763 million  in fiscal 2012 

working capital 

  

 

the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 days sales outstanding increased as a result of higher product shipments made to our distributors in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

inventory as of november 3 2012  increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of an increase in manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand days cost of sales in inventory increased primarily due to lower manufacturing costs which resulted in cost of sales decreasing 2 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in addition inventory levels increased by 6 for the same period 

current liabilities of 5251 million at november 3 2012  remained flat to the 5250 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2011 as an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors net which is more fully described below and an increase in accounts payable was offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of lower variable compensation expense accruals 

as of november 3 2012  and october 29 2011  we had gross deferred revenue of 2990 million  and 3096 million  respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 605 million  and 764 million  respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products in the channel sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 debt 

as of november 3 2012  we had 8216 million  in debt outstanding of which 145 million  was current our debt obligations consist of the following 

3750 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes 

on june 30 2009 we issued 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the 50 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on january 1 and july 1 of each year commencing january 1 2010 we swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 the variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate were payable quarterly the libor based rate was set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we terminated the interest rate swap agreement we received 198 million in cash proceeds from the swap termination which included 13 million in accrued interest the proceeds net of interest received are disclosed in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the termination the carrying value of the 50 notes was adjusted for the change in fair value of the interest component of the debt up to the date of the termination of the swap in an amount equal to the fair value of the swap and will be amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt this amortization is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities 

1450 million term loan facility 

on december 22 2010 analog devices holdings bv our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with bank of america na london branch as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a 1450 million term loan facility which matures on december 22 2013 we have guaranteed the borrower’s obligations the terms of the agreement provide for a threeyear principal amortization schedule with 36 million payable quarterly every march june september and december with the balance payable upon the maturity date 

3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes 

on april 4 2011 we issued 3750 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 the 30 notes with semiannual fixed interest payments due on april 15 and october 15 of each year commencing october 15 2011 

the indenture governing the 50 notes and 30 notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party as of november 3 2012  we were compliant with these covenants the terms of the 1450 million term loan facility include limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries and also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio as of november 3 2012  we were compliant with these covenants see note 16 debt   of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our outstanding debt 

revolving credit facility 

we have a fiveyear 1650 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2013 to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance stock repurchases dividend payments acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes the terms of this facility also include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio as of november 3 2012  we were compliant with these covenants 

          stock repurchase program 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004  in the aggregate our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 50 billion  of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of november 3 2012  we had repurchased a total of approximately 1292 million  shares of our common stock for approximately 44390 million  under this program as of november 3 2012  an additional 5610 million  worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial 

performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 

         capital expenditures 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1322 million  in fiscal 2012 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately 90 million to 120 million in fiscal 2013 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities and to be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

         dividends 

on november 26 2012  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 030  per outstanding share of common stock the dividend will be paid on december 18 2012  to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 7 2012  and is expected to total approximately 904 million  we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 030 per share although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

         contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 3 2012  



 

 purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

our 2011 acquisition of lyric semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note 6 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our acquisitions 

as of november 3 2012  our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 101 million  which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 3 2012  

offbalance sheet financing 

as of november 3 2012  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

outlook 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us 

we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be down approximately 6 to 12 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately 620 we are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be approximately 223 million and our tax rate to be approximately 18 as a result our plan is for diluted eps to be approximately 040 to 048 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations see note 2t new accounting pronouncements   of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

inventory valuation 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

longlived assets 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist the impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 

goodwill 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on august 5 2012 we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

value of contingent consideration related to business combination 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

accounting for income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following items 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 44  to all unvested stockbased awards as of november 3 2012 the rate of 44  represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

contingencies 

from time to time we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

postretirement benefits 

 we  have significant pension costs and liabilities related to our foreign defined benefit pension plans that are developed from actuarial valuations specific to each country inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates merit and promotion increases we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making our assumptions changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in our assumptions our assumptions as to the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets historical longterm rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions the discount rate used for nonus plans reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on our annual measurement date november 3 and is subject to change each year the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment changes in pension incomecosts or assetsliabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values if the actual results and events of our pension plan differ from our current assumptions our benefit obligations may be overor undervalued see the disclosures about pension obligations the composition of plan assets assumptions and other matters in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

           we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm rate of return on assets which are key assumptions in determining our net periodic postretirement benefit cost the table below illustrates the impact of an increasedecrease of 25 basis points in these assumptions for the year ended november 3 2012 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments debt and interestrate swap agreement 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of november 3 2012  and october 29 2011  our annual interest income would change by approximately 41 million and 38 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of november 3 2012  and october 29 2011  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 10 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of november 3 2012  we had 750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 375 million 5 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 and 375 million 3 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 as of november 3 2012  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 375 million of 3 senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately 13 million as of november 3 2012  a similar increase in market interest rates would change the fair value of our 375 million 5 senior unsecured notes by 6 million 

foreign currency exposure 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 3 2012  and october 29 2011  a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately 1 million in losses in earnings or cash flows 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of november 3 2012  we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 3 2012  and october 29 2011  



the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors contained in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington 

  massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

 

capital spending was approximately 1230 million in fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 1116 million in fiscal 2010 we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately 100 million to 125 million in fiscal 2012 

 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2011 was approximately 379 million down from approximately 563 million at the end of fiscal 2010 we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2011 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  competition 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

we believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competiveness in our chosen markets 

 

environment health and safety 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc our sustainability report first published in 2009 states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union and china and the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directive in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of october 29 2011 we employed approximately 9200 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

there is significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities high unemployment rates weakness in commercial and residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges financial turmoil may cause financial institutions to consolidate or go out of business which increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair value assigned to them during the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and as these programs conclude those businesses could be negatively impacted the continuing debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers in addition the recent downgrade of the us credit rating and the ongoing european debt crisis have contributed to the instability in global credit markets we are unable to predict the impact of these events and if economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

 11 

   

  

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stockbased compensation awards are less than those originally anticipated changes in available tax credits and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income for future periods 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our 

  customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside the united states many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have or as a result of consolidation within the industry may have greater financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs additionally we utilize a limited number of thirdparty wafer fabricators primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the third party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal 2011 was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily tsmc 

 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive 

  resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may in the future be sued by third parties with respect to infringement or other product matters and those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid from time to time we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and 

  potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

we may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

 

we may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that 

  have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

  

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide for example in march 2011 a severe earthquake and tsunami hit japan which together with resulting damage to certain nuclear power plants created widespread destruction and economic uncertainty in that region japan represented approximately 13 of our revenue in fiscal 2011 any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines during fiscal 2011 we derived approximately 82 of our revenue from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products at october 29 2011 our principal source of liquidity was 35925 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of october 29 2011 approximately 11705 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign 

  earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection competition practices intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages penalties and civil and criminal fines and might damage our reputation increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

  new climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations and the us congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future the us environmental protection agency epa has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations epa is developing other climate changebased regulations as are certain states that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations additionally any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties civil and criminal fines suspension of or changes to production legal liability and damage to our reputation 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our two issuances of 375 million senior unsecured notes or our 145 million term loan facility 

 

in fiscal 2009 we issued in a public offering 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 in april 2011 we issued in a public offering 375 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 in december 2010 analog devices holdings bv a wholly owned subsidiary of ours entered into a 145 million term loan facility which matures on december 22 2013 our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes or our term loan facility which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

 

restrictions in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

 

our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our 50 and 30 senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our credit and term loan facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

  our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product  

 

during fiscal 2011 our revenue increased 8 as compared to fiscal 2010 our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 279 in fiscal 2011 from 233 in fiscal 2010 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was 9005 million or 30 of revenue we received proceeds of 5155 million during fiscal 2011 from the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes and from a 145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in addition we received 2172 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises during fiscal 2011 we repurchased a total of approximately 90 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 3303 million distributed 2816 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid 1230 million for property plant and equipment additions these factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 3351 million in fiscal 2011 

 

the yeartoyear increase in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of improved global macroeconomic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year the strong growth we experienced in the first six months of fiscal 2011 including a 9 sequential revenue increase in our second fiscal quarter was followed by sequential revenue declines in both the third and fourth fiscal quarters the 9 sequential revenue increase in the second fiscal quarter included increased inventory stocking by our customers as a result of the japanese earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2011 we began to see revenue declines attributable to inventory corrections following the inventory buildup in the prior quarters and declining demand as the deficit and credit related crisis in europe and the us caused customers to become more cautious in the second half of fiscal 2011 

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market during fiscal year 2011 we consolidated the computer end market which represented approximately 1 of fiscal 2011 revenue into the consumer end market and reclassified handset 

  revenue which represented approximately 3 of fiscal 2011 revenue from the communications end market to the consumer end market for all periods presented 

 

 

 

 

  

industrial — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the automation and instrumentation sectors and to a lesser extent products sold into the energy and healthcare sectors the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors 

 

automotive  — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles and to a lesser extent a general increase in demand by our customers the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various governmentinitiated incentive programs inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles 

 

consumer — the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march 2011 partially offset by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices in this end market the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications 

 

communications — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for the basestation end market sector the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for the infrastructure sector 

  revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in total revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 and from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broadbased increase in sales across all of our product categories 

 

revenue trends by geographic region 

 

revenue by geographic region based upon customer location for the last three fiscal years is as follows 

 

 

 

in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and south korea 

 

sales increased in all geographic regions except japan in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of increases in sales activity in the industrial automotive and communications end market sectors the yeartoyear decrease in sales in japan was primarily the result of lower sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march 2011 

  sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 with sales in europe and the rest of asia experiencing the largest increases the increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2011 by 120 basis points as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of 2318 million increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication consolidation actions additionally a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets 

 

gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of 7466 million increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs including the savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication facility consolidations additionally a higher proportion of our revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets 

 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

rd expenses increased 133 million or 3 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased headcount and a general increase in spending these increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

 

research and development or rd expenses in fiscal 2010 increased 453 million or 10 from fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 

 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

  selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

selling marketing general and administrative or smga expenses increased 161 million or 4 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased headcount and a general increase in spending these increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth 

 

smga expenses in fiscal 2010 increased 574 million or 17 from fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense which was a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and higher sales commission expenses which are variable expenses linked to our sales these increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the prior two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 

 

special charges 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

 

we ceased production at our california wafer fabrication facility in november 2006 we paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term which expired in march 2010 we recorded a onetime settlement charge of 04 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease this action was completed during fiscal 2010 

 

consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick 

 

during fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010 we recorded special charges of 164 million as a result of our decision to only use eightinch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick these special charges included 149 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees and 15 million for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred the production in the sixinch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 this action was completed during fiscal 2010 this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 25 million per year 

 

reduction of operating costs 

 

during fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 in order to further reduce our operating cost structure we recorded special charges of approximately 433 million these special charges included 391 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and smga employees 21 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 08 million for the writeoff of property plant and equipment 05 million for contract termination costs 03 million for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred and 05 million related to the impairment of intellectual property this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 52 million per year we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and we are paying amounts owed to them as income continuance 

 

during fiscal 2011 in order to further reduce our operating cost structure we recorded a special charge of approximately 22 million this special charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and smga employees as of october 29 2011 we still employed 13 of the 25 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we estimate this action will result in annual savings in smga expenses of approximately 4 million once fully implemented 

  closure of a wafer fabrication facility in cambridge 

 

during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we recorded special charges of 268 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our cambridge massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing wilmington massachusetts facility these special charges included 74 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 smga employees 146 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets 34 million for lease obligation costs for the cambridge wafer fabrication facility which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 14 million for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred this action was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 this action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 43 million per year 

 

operating income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the 1720 million or 19 increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 2318 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross margin percentage 

 

the 6153 million or 216 increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 7466 million a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

nonoperating income expense was higher by 122 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes on april 4 2011 and the 145 million term loan facility entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in december 2010 in addition we earned lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 which was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances in fiscal 2011 

 

nonoperating income was lower by 11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal 50 senior unsecured notes on june 30 2009 resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010 in addition we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

  our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower by 220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 the tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the following items which caused a decrease in our tax rate the reinstatement of the federal rd tax credit in december 2010 retroactive to january 1 2010 resulting in a 60 million income tax savings a 67 million reduction in the state tax credit valuation reserve that we believe we can now recover a 05 million tax benefit from the increase in irish deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the irish manufacturing tax rate from 10 to 125 and a net 108 million tax benefit related to the settlement with the appeals office of the internal revenue service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years fiscal 2010 also included a higher special charge a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate as compared to the special charge recorded in fiscal 2011 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate in addition higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009 a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax 

 

 

 

net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was higher than in fiscal 2010 by approximately 1497 million primarily as a result of the 1720 million increase in operating income from continuing operations offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately 4638 million primarily as a result of the 6153 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements

in fiscal 2006 we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privatelyheld integrant technologies inc integrant of seoul korea the acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened our 

  presence in the asia region we paid 84 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july 2007 through july 2009 we recorded these payments as additional goodwill

in fiscal 2011 we acquired privatelyheld lyric semiconductor inc lyric of cambridge massachusetts the acquisition of lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 278 million which consisted of 140 million in initial cash payments at closing and contingent consideration of up to 138 million the contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash payments to the former equity holders of lyric upon the achievement of certain technological and product development milestones payable during the period from june 2011 through june 2016 as of october 29 2011 no contingent payments have been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately 140 million we allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition resulting in the recognition of 122 million of inprocess research and development 189 million of goodwill and 33 million of net deferred tax liabilities in addition we will be obligated to pay royalties to the former equity holders of lyric on revenue recognized from the sale of lyric products and licenses through the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of 25 million royalty payments to lyric employees require postacquisition services to be rendered and as such we will record these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods as of october 29 2011 no royalty payments have been made we recognized 02 million of acquisition related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 these costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

 

we have not provided pro forma results of operations for integrant audioasics and lyric in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

at october 29 2011 cash and cash equivalents totaled 14051 million the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2011 were net cash generated from operating activities of 9005 million proceeds of 5155 million relating to the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal amount of 30 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 and the 145 million term loan facility we entered into through a wholly owned subsidiary in addition we received 2172 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises the principal uses of funds for fiscal 2011 were the repurchase of approximately 9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 3303 million 

  dividend payments of 2816 million and additions to property plant and equipment of 1230 million these factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 3351 million in fiscal 2011 

 

 

 

 

  

accounts receivable at october 29 2011 decreased 388 million or 10 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the decrease in receivables was primarily the result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 days sales outstanding decreased by two days as a result of lower product shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

inventory at october 29 2011 increased by 176 million or 6 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support the higher revenue levels recorded in fiscal 2011 days cost of sales in inventory increased five days primarily due to lower manufacturing costs which resulted in cost of sales increasing only 1 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to a 6 increase in inventory during this same time period 

 

current liabilities decreased to 5250 million at october 29 2011 a decrease of 1185 million or 18 from 6435 million at the end of fiscal 2010 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income tax payable as a result of the settlement with the appeals office of the internal revenue service of certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years in addition accrued liabilities declined as a result of a decrease in accruals related to variable compensation expense 

 

as of october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 we had gross deferred revenue of 3113 million and 3272 million respectively and gross deferred cost of sales of 781 million and 844 million respectively deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by approximately 96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the distributors’ sales to their customers in fiscal 2011 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive priceadjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory given the uncertainties associated with the levels of priceadjustment credits to be granted to distributors the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers therefore we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers the amount of priceadjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1230 million in fiscal 2011 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately 100 million to 125 million in fiscal 2012 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities 

 

during fiscal 2011 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 094 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of 2816 million after the end of fiscal 2011 on november 18 2011 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 025 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 21 2011 to shareholders of record on december 2 2011 and is expected to total approximately 75 million we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 025 per share 

  although they remain subject to declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 5 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 29 2011 we had repurchased a total of approximately 1250 million shares of our common stock for approximately 42785 million under this program as of october 29 2011 an additional 7215 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 29 2011 

 

 

 

 

 37 

    

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

our 2011 acquisition of lyric semiconductor involves the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note 6 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our acquisitions 

 

as of october 29 2011 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 208 million which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 29 2011 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of october 29 2011 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

outlook 

 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us 

 

we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be down approximately 5 to 10 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 our plan is for gross margin percentage for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be approximately 630 plus or minus 50 basis points we are planning for operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be in the range of 226 million to 229 million as a result our plan is for diluted eps to be approximately 044 to 051 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

standards implemented 

 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 200913 — revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements formerly eitf issue no 081 asu no 200913 this standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements such as product software services or support to a customer at different 

  times as part of a single revenue generating transaction this standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables the standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements asu no 200913 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after june 15 2010 which is our fiscal year 2011 the adoption of asu 200913 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 did not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

standards to be implemented 

 

business combinations 

 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201029 business combinations asc topic 805 — disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu no 201029 asu no 201029 requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year it also requires a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings the new disclosure will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2012 the adoption of asu no 201029 will require additional disclosure in the event of a business combination but will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

intangibles — goodwill and other 

 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201028 intangiblesgoodwill and other asc topic 350 asu no 201028 asu no 201028 modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist asu 201028 is effective for fiscal years that begin after december 15 2010 which is our fiscal year 2012 we do not expect the adoption of asu no 201028 to impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

fair value measurement 

 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu no 201104 asu no 201104 amended asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  to converge the fair value measurement guidance in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements while other amendments change a particular principle in asc 820 in addition asu no 201104 requires additional fair value disclosures the amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 which is our second quarter of fiscal year 2012 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 201104 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

comprehensive income 

 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 asu no 201105 amended asc 320 comprehensive income to converge the presentation of comprehensive income between us gaap and ifrs asu no 201105 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and also requires reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented asu no 201105 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity asu 201105 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 which is our fiscal year 

  2013 the adoption of asu no 201105 will affect the presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 

 

intangibles — goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment 

 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 intangibles — goodwill and other asc topic 350 testing for goodwill impairment asu no 201108 asu no 201108 provides a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain conditions leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances a company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep goodwill impairment test is unnecessary however if a company concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test asu no 201108 is effective for fiscal years that begin after december 15 2011 which is our fiscal year 2013 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 201108 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are 

  expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist the impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter on or about august 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist for our latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on july 31 2011 we identified our reporting units to be our five operating segments which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

value of contingent consideration related to business combination 

 

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the 

  uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

  expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 43 to all unvested stockbased awards as of october 29 2011 the rate of 43 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate exposure 

 

our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in this regard changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments as well as the fair value of our investments debt and interestrate swap agreement 

 

based on our marketable securities and shortterm investments outstanding as of october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 our annual interest income would change by approximately 38 million and 27 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 4 million decline in each year in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

 

as of october 29 2011 we had 750 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding which consisted of 375 million 5 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 and 375 million 3 senior unsecured notes due april 15 2016 as of october 29 2011 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 375 million of 3 senior unsecured notes outstanding by approximately 16 million as of october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 a similar increase in market interest rates would not change the fair value of our 375 million 5 senior unsecured notes which have been hedged by an interest rate swap agreement any changes to fair value of the 5 senior unsecured notes would be offset by the change in the fair value of the corresponding interest rate swap 

  we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our 375 million 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the effect of the swap is to convert our 50 fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 242 as of october 29 2011 in addition we have a term loan facility of 145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 125 161 as of october 29 2011 if libor increases by 100 basis points our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 5 million however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our 375 million of 3 fixedrate debt which is not hedged as of october 30 2010 a similar 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately 4 million to our annual interest expense 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately 6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows 

 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 2011 we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29 2011 and october 30 2010 

 

 

 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background 

 

electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog signals also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound light speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which generate an electronic signal of continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” or dsp digital signals are often converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control we refer to these manipulations and transformations as “realworld signal processing” providing realworld signal processing solutions that achieve the customer’s desired performance generally involves working in multiple technology domains analog and digital processing sensors and transducers and power management 

 

new organizational structure in 2009 product and market organizations 

 

we implemented a new organizational structure at the end of 2009 with the intention of optimizing our focus on the technologies we create and the markets we serve we continue to operate with one reporting segment but under the new organizational structure we have two separate groups one focused on products and one focused on end markets the product group is focused on core technology development and leadership in converters amplifiers and radio frequency or rf microelectromechanical sensors or mems power management and dsp the end marketfocused organization is dedicated to understanding selecting and resourcing initiatives that are more customized to a particular market or application the focus of this team is to apply the full expanse of our broad technology portfolio to more integrated and targeted product strategies for the industrial healthcare automotive consumer and communications infrastructure markets the end market group includes our sales organization 

 

these two new groups collaborate at all levels on the one hand our product group develops key technology for use by the end market groups which apply these technologies to specific applications equally important the applications expertise within each end market group is used to enhance core technology development by our product group 

 

principal products 

 

we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications our product portfolio includes both generalpurpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing more customized ics our standard products often provide a costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications however for some industrial medical automotive consumer and communications products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion amplification rf mems power management and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

we produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reporting segment our ten highest revenue products in the aggregate accounted for approximately 9 of our revenue for fiscal 2010 a breakdown of our fiscal 2010 revenue by product category follows 

 

 

 

analog products 

 

our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for over four decades and we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of highperformance analog ics our analog signal processing ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined today as devices that support a minimum of 12bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these products have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components resulting in improved reliability our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems 

 

we derive the majority of our analog signal processing ic product revenue from sales of data converters and amplifiers we are the industry’s leading supplier of data converter products data converters translate realworld analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products with the industry’s leading portfolio of adcs analogtodigital converters and dacs digitaltoanalog converters our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise power price and small package size required by industrial medical automotive consumer and communications electronics we are also a leading supplier of highperformance amplifiers amplifiers are used to condition analog signals and minimize noise we provide high speed precision rf broadband instrumentation and other amplifiers we also offer an extensive portfolio of comparators that are used in a wide variety of applications 

 

our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of rf ics covering the entire rf signal chain from industryleading high performance rf function blocks to highly integrated broadband and shortrange single chip transceiver solutions to date we have sold our rf ics principally for cellular infrastructure and pointtopoint applications and have been focused on the high performance end of the market 

 

also within our analog technology portfolio are products that use an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables us to build extremely small mechanical sensing elements on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems ®  our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration gyroscopes used to sense rotation and mems microphones used to capture audio sounds the majority of our current revenue from mems products is derived from automotive manufacturers industrial customers and consumer customers 

 

power management and reference products make up the balance of our analog sales whether the product is plugged into the wall or runs on batteries every electronic device requires some form of power management which can include converters battery chargers charge pumps and regulators we leverage our leading analog signal 

technology to devise innovative highperformance power management ics highreliability infrastructure equipment and batteryoperated portable medical communications and consumer devices 

 

digital signal processing products 

 

digital signal processors dsps complete our product portfolio dsps are optimized for highspeed numeric calculations which are essential for instantaneous or realtime processing of digital data generated in most cases from analog to digital signal conversion our dsp products are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs or algorithms associated with processing digitized realtime realworld data programmable dsps provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software our generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools that we provide and software development tools they obtain from thirdparty suppliers our dsps are designed in families of products that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same software we support these products with easytouse development tools which are designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs and timetomarket

see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our products by category and end market 

 

research and development 

 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 492 million during fiscal 2010 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 447 million during fiscal 2009 and approximately 533 million during fiscal 2008 

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters amplifiers and rf mems power management and dsp in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development at 33 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world 

 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 30 2010 we held approximately 1600 us patents and approximately 560 nonprovisional pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components 

 

sales channels 

 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website 

 

we derived approximately 56 of our fiscal 2010 revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products which compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the categorization of sales into geographic regions set forth below is based upon the location of the customer 

 

 

 

we also have sales representatives andor distributors in over 40 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding revenue and financial information 

about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our website we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 

 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 4 of our fiscal 2010 revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 32 of our fiscal 2010 revenue these customers used hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive communication consumer and computer markets 

 

seasonality 

 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors included elsewhere in this report our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

foreign operations 

 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2010 we derived approximately 81 of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we closed our wafer fabrication facility in cambridge massachusetts at the end of fiscal 2009 we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

 

capital spending was 1116 million in fiscal 2010 compared with 561 million in fiscal 2009 we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately 120 million to 130 million in fiscal 2011 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2010 was approximately 563 million up from approximately 411 million at the end of fiscal 2009 we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 4 of our fiscal 2010 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include 

 

 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

environment health and safety 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety ehs regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve excellence in ehs management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9001 and ts16949 we are an applicant member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition or eicc in fiscal 2009 we published our first sustainability report which stated our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report in or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign ehs laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the restriction of hazardous substances rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach directives in the european union contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional ehs compliance standards compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly 

requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter fabrication processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of october 30 2010 we employed approximately 8500 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from extreme disruptions experienced over the past two years however uncertainty about continuing economic stability remains our business was significantly affected by the global economic crisis these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities high unemployment rates continued weakness in commercial and residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to continue to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition the inability of customers to obtain credit could impair their ability to make timely payments to us customer insolvencies could also negatively impact our revenues and our ability to collect receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges financial turmoil may cause financial institutions to consolidate or go out of business which increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair value assigned to them during the global financial crisis many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and as these programs conclude those businesses could be negatively impacted the recent debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of our european customers in addition the recent european debt crisis and related financial restructuring efforts has contributed to the instability in global credit markets we are unable to predict the impact of these events on the apparent economic recovery and if economic conditions deteriorate again we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

 11 

 

  

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income for future periods 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on 

investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside the united states many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on suppliers assembly and test subcontractors and thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs additionally we utilize a limited number of thirdparty wafer fabricators primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints in certain instances the third party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers if replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers a significant portion of our fiscal 2010 revenue was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily tsmc 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may in the future be sued by third parties with respect to infringement or other product matters and those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid from time to time we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be 

necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts both in the us and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to 

raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

  

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines during fiscal 2010 we derived approximately 81 of our revenue from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products while a majority of our cash is generated outside the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection competition practices intellectual property anti 

corruption and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations anticorruption and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety ehs regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict ehs requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention to environmental concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by releases of such materials any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could result in penalties civil and criminal fines and damage our reputation and might increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

 

new climate change regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for us the commonwealth of massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas requirements and the us congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future the us environmental protection agency epa is preparing greenhouse gas reporting regulations that are likely to apply to us epa may propose other climate changebased regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future ehs laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations additionally any failure by us to comply with applicable ehs requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties civil and criminal fines suspension of or changes to production legal liability and damage to our reputation 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our 375 million senior unsecured notes 

 

in fiscal 2009 we issued in a public offering 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when 

due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms 

 

restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

 

our current credit facility and our 50 senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product  

 

in fiscal 2010 our revenue increased 37 from fiscal 2009 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from 085 to 233 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 was 9912 million or 36 of revenue in addition we received 2161 million in net proceeds related to employee stock option exercises 

distributed 250 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid 1116 million for capital expenditures these factors contributed to the net increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 8718 million in fiscal 2010 

 

the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a resurgence in economic activity from the low levels achieved during 2009 as a result of the general economic downturn following the global credit and financial crisis the strategy we employed during the start of the economic downturn to be more focused on products and markets that value innovation and to make fundamental improvements to our cost structure aided in our growth improving macro trends in the industrial communications automotive and healthcare markets helped and we believe will continue to help to generate strong growth opportunities for us in the future however these trends remain uncertain and we cannot predict the sustainability of the current economic conditions consequently our reported results for fiscal 2010 may not be indicative of our future results 

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 

 

 

 

 

  

industrial — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased decline in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and process controls sectors 

 

automotive  — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of increased demand due to various governmentinitiated incentive programs inventory replenishment and a general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in automotive end market revenue was primarily due to economic conditions relating to the global credit crisis resulting in cautious customer spending behavior 

 

consumer — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and other consumer applications the yeartoyear decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment digital cameras and video game applications consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending 

communications — the yeartoyear increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased increase in demand in this end market which was most significant for the infrastructure sector the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations wireless handsets and networking applications 

 

revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in total revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the result of a broadbased increase in sales across all of our product categories the decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve particularly the industrial and consumer end markets as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy 

 

revenue trends by geographic region 

 

the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three fiscal years is as follows 

 

 

in fiscal year 2010 and 2009 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan south korea and singapore in fiscal year 2008 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and south korea 

 

sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 with sales in europe and the rest of asia experiencing the largest increases the increase in sales was the result of an increase in demand for our products primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide 

 

sales declined in all geographic regions in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 with sales in europe and japan experiencing the largest decline this decline in sales in europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market the decline in sales in japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis the decline in china was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in china’s recent infrastructure buildout of the country’s next generation of communication technology 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by 970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in sales of 7466 million increased operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs including the savings realized as a result of wafer fabrication facility consolidations additionally a higher proportion of our revenues was from products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors of the industrial end market which earn higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end markets 

 

gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of 5680 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances 

 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

research and development or rd expenses in fiscal 2010 increased 453 million or 10 from fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability partially offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 

 

rd expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased 865 million or 16 from fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 

 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our 

existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

selling marketing general and administrative or smga expenses in fiscal 2010 increased 574 million or 17 from fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense which is a variable expense linked to our overall profitability and higher sales commission expenses which are variable expenses linked to our sales these increases were offset by the impact of actions we took over the past two years to control discretionary spending and permanently reduce operating expenses 

 

smga expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased 825 million or 20 from fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

as of october 30 2010 the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately 95 million before tax consideration which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 14 years 

 

during fiscal 2009 our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program option exchange the option exchange provided our eligible employees excluding our named executive officers and directors the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price or in some instances cash that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered 

 

see note 3 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our stock based compensation 

 

special charges 

 

the following is a summary of ongoing restructuring actions we have taken over the last several years 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

 

we ceased production at our california wafer fabrication facility in november 2006 we paid the related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term which expired in march 2010 we recorded a onetime settlement charge of 04 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease this action was completed in fiscal 2010 

 

consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick 

 

in fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge of 137 million as a result of our decision to only use eightinch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the limerick facility’s sixinch production line have transitioned to our existing eightinch production line in limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action we terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and have paid out all amounts owed to employees as severance during fiscal 2008 we recorded an additional charge of 15 million related to this action of which 12 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and 03 million was for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded additional charges of 

12 million for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred the production in the sixinch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 this action was completed in fiscal 2010 the closure of this facility resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 25 million per year which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 these savings are recorded in cost of sales of which approximately 1 million relates to noncash depreciation savings 

 

reduction of operating costs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in order to further reduce our operating cost structure we recorded a special charge of 16 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or the statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering selling marketing general and administrative employees 

 

during fiscal 2009 we recorded an additional charge of 303 million related to this cost reduction action approximately 21 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 approximately 08 million was for the writeoff of property plant and equipment no longer used as a result of this action and approximately 05 million was for contract termination costs and approximately 03 million was for cleanup and closure costs that we expensed as incurred the remaining 266 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and smga employees this cost reduction action which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 resulted in annual savings of approximately 364 million these annual savings are being realized as follows approximately 316 million in smga expenses and approximately 48 million in cost of sales 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded an additional charge of 114 million related to the further reduction of our operating cost structure approximately 109 million of this charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 149 engineering and smga employees approximately 05 million of the charge relates to our decision to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in power management resulting in the impairment of related intellectual property when fully implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result in annual savings of approximately 16 million 

 

we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance 

 

closure of a wafer fabrication facility in cambridge 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded a special charge of 221 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our cambridge massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing wilmington massachusetts facility in connection with the anticipated closure of this facility we evaluated the recoverability of the facility’s manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately 129 million based on the revised period of intended use the remaining 92 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 smga employees associated with this action 

 

we finished production in the cambridge wafer fabrication facility and began cleanup activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we reversed approximately 18 million of our severance accrual the accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the company or found alternative employment within the company in addition we recorded a special charge of approximately 17 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use we also recorded a special charge of 01 million for cleanup costs as we began our cleanup of the cambridge wafer fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance we estimate that this action will result in annual cost savings of approximately 41 million per year which we began realizing in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect these annual savings to be realized as follows approximately 402 million 

in cost of sales of which approximately 40 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 08 million relates to smga expenses 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded an additional charge of 47 million related to this cost reduction action approximately 34 million of the charge related to lease obligation costs for the cambridge wafer fabrication facility which we ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the remaining 13 million of the charge related to cleanup and closure costs these cost reductions resulted in annual savings of approximately 24 million which we began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

operating income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the 6153 million or 216 increase in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of 7466 million a 970 basis point increase in gross margin percentage and lower special charges recorded in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

the 3402 million or 54 decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 5680 million a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of 506 million in special charges this decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in rd and smga expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  

 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

nonoperating income was lower by 11 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal 50 senior unsecured notes on june 30 2009 resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in 2010 in addition we earned lower interest income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

nonoperating income was lower by 285 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 in addition we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal 50 senior unsecured notes on june 30 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap in june 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate in addition higher special charges recorded in fiscal 2009 a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate contributed to a higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of 537 million in fiscal 2009 a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax 

 

 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2010 was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately 4638 million primarily as a result of the 6153 million increase in operating income that was partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately 2778 million primarily as a result of the 3402 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements 

 

acquisitions 

 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privatelyheld integrant technologies inc integrant of seoul korea the acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened our presence in the asia region we paid 84 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july 2007 through july 2009 we recorded these payments as additional goodwill 

 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired all the outstanding stock of privatelyheld audioasics as audioasics of roskilde denmark the acquisition of audioasics allows us to continue developing lowpower audio solutions while expanding our presence in the nordic and eastern european regions we paid additional cash payments of 

31 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenuebased milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009 which we recorded as additional goodwill in addition in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents we paid 32 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009 which we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008 all revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made 

 

we have not provided pro forma results of operations for integrant and audioasics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

at october 30 2010 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 26878 million an increase of 8718 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2010 were net cash generated from operating activities of 9912 million and 2161 million in net proceeds from employee stock option exercises the principal uses of funds for fiscal 2010 were dividend payments of 2500 million and capital expenditures of 1116 million 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented we believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position additionally as a result of these dispositions we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations see note 2u in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these discontinued operations 

 

 

 

 

  

accounts receivable at october 30 2010 increased 861 million or 29 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the increase in receivables was the result of higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

inventory at october 30 2010 increased by 243 million or 10 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the increase in inventory relates primarily to an increase in manufacturing production to support higher sales demand 

 

current liabilities increased to 6435 million at october 30 2010 an increase of 2569 million or 66 from 3866 million at the end of fiscal 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher deferred income on shipments to distributors in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and an increase in accrued liabilities relating to variable 

compensation expense in addition income taxes payable increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of higher profits and a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment including discontinued operations were 1116 million in fiscal 2010 561 million in fiscal 2009 and 1574 million in fiscal 2008 we expect fiscal 2011 capital expenditures to be in the range of 120 million to 130 million 

 

during fiscal 2010 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 084 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of 2500 million after the end of fiscal 2010 on november 19 2010 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 022 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 22 2010 to shareholders of record on december 3 2010 and is expected to total approximately 66 million we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at 022 per share although they remain subject to declaration by our board of directors the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 4 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 30 2010 we had repurchased a total of approximately 1160 million shares of our common stock for approximately 39482 million under this program as of october 30 2010 an additional 518 million remained available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program on november 19 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional 1 billion of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted to our employees under our equity compensation plans any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the united states 

 

on june 30 2009 we issued 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the notes with annual interest payments of 50 paid in two installments on january 1 and july 1 of each year commencing january 1 2010 the net proceeds of the offering were 3704 million after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses underwriting discounts and commissions which will be amortized over the term of the notes we swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 234 as of october 30 2010 the variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly the libor based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party in addition we have a fiveyear 165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2013 to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance stock repurchases dividend payments acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 

 

at october 30 2010 our principal source of liquidity was 26878 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of october 30 2010 approximately 7254 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases 

 

the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets while there are signs that conditions may be improving there is no certainty that the current tentative recovery in credit and financial markets will continue we are unable to predict the likely duration of the tentative 

recovery in the credit and financial markets however we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and purchases of stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 

 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 30 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

as of october 30 2010 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 283 million which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain 

tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 30 2010 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of october 30 2010 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

outlook 

 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us 

 

we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 715 million to 740 million our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be approximately 66 we are planning for operating margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 345 to 355 as a result our plan is for diluted eps from continuing operations to be approximately 063 to 067 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

revenue arrangements that include software elements 

 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 200914 — software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements formerly eitf issue no 093 this standard removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance more specifically if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential to the functionality of the tangible product then this software as well as undelivered software elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue guidance asu no 200914 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after june 15 2010 which is our fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 200914 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200913 — revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements formerly eitf issue no 081 this standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements such as product software services or support to a customer at different times as part of a single revenue generating transaction this standard provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables the standard also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 200913 is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after june 15 2010 which is our fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 200913 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

variable interest entities 

 

in december 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200917 — consolidations topic 810 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which amends asc 810 consolidation  this standard requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable 

interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity additionally an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance asu no 200917 is effective for fiscal years that begin after november 15 2009 which is our fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 200917 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

transfers of financial assets 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200916 accounting for transfers of financial assets topic 820 this standard changes the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments asu no 200916 is effective for fiscal years that begin after november 15 2009 which is our fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that asu no 200916 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be 

recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

on november 4 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions these principles requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on 

factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made in addition to the factors described above our current and expected effective tax rate is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 43 to all unvested stockbased awards as of october 30 2010 the rate of 43 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive demands from third parties alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

interest rate exposure 

 

based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of october 30 2010 and october 31 2009 our annual interest income would change by approximately 27 million and 18 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 30 2010 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 4 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of october 31 2009 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in approximately 3 million of incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

 

in june 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our 375 million 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the effect of the swap was to convert our 50 fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 234 as of october 30 2010 if libor changes by 100 basis points our annual interest expense would change by approximately 4 million 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 30 2010 and october 31 2009 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately 6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows 

 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 30 2010 and october 31 2009 

 

 

 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

  industry background 

 

all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog signals also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control we refer to these manipulations and transformations as “realworld signal processing” 

 

significant developments in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these developments include 

 

  

principal products 

 

we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our product portfolio are both generalpurpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing more customized ics our standard products often provide a costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications however in some industrial communications consumer and computer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion amplification power management radio frequency and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

 

we produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reporting segment our ten highest revenue products in the aggregate accounted for approximately 9 of our revenue for fiscal 2009 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions a breakdown of our fiscal 2009 revenue by product category follows

computer — revenues from computer customers now comprise only a small percentage of our total revenue given the limited opportunity for high performance signal processing technology in this market 

 

research and development 

 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 447 million during fiscal 2009 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 533 million during fiscal 2008 and approximately 510 million during fiscal 2007 

 

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters linear including amplifiers and radio frequency rf technology power management sensors and digital signal processing in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development at 34 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world 

 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 31 2009 we held approximately 1499 us patents and approximately 604 nonprovisional pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every 

  jurisdiction while our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets which are akin to the blueprint for building an ic under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 

 

sales channels 

 

we sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our website 

 

we derived approximately 54 of our fiscal 2009 product revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products which compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the categorization of sales into geographic regions set forth below is based upon the location of the customer 

 

 

 

we also have sales representatives andor distributors in over 40 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our website we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 

 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 5 of our fiscal 2009 revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 37 of our fiscal 2009 revenue these customers used hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial communication consumer and computer markets 

  seasonality 

 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors included elsewhere in this report our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

foreign operations 

 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2009 we derived approximately 80 of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes approximately 49 44 and 43 of our revenue in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland we closed our wafer fabrication facility in cambridge massachusetts at the end of fiscal 2009 we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

 

capital spending was 561 million in fiscal 2009 compared with 1574 million in fiscal 2008 we currently plan to make capital expenditures in the range of 60 million to 70 million in fiscal 2010 

 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2009 was approximately 411 million up from approximately 333 million at the end of fiscal 2008 we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter 

  lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 5 of our fiscal 2009 product revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

competition 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include 

 

 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

  many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

environment 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention to reduce our energy consumption and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

our management systems are certified to iso 14001 ohsas 18001 iso 9000 and ts16949 we are an applicant member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc in fiscal 2009 we published our first sustainability report which detailed our commitment to reduced consumption of energy and fair labor standards among other things we are not including the information contained in our sustainability report or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process in addition our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content under european union regulatory programs such as rohs and reach enacted by individual countries contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional environmental compliance obligations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production alteration of fabrication processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of october 31 2009 we employed approximately 8300 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

the current crisis in global credit and financial markets could further materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

as widely reported global credit and financial markets continue to experience disruptions including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability our business has been significantly affected by these conditions while there are signs that conditions may be improving there is no certainty that this trend will continue or that credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not deteriorate again these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities accelerating layoffs falling housing markets and the tightening of credit by financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to continue to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition the inability of customers to obtain credit could impair their ability to make timely payments to us customer insolvencies in key industries such as the automotive industry could also negatively impact our revenues and our ability to collect receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges the financial turmoil could cause financial institutions to consolidate or go out of business which increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair value assigned to them we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

 10 

   

  

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations 

 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions changes in available tax credits and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income for future periods 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry 

  standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields quality assurance and costs additionally we utilize a limited number of thirdparty wafer fabricators primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers approximately 49 of our fiscal year 2009 revenue was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily tsmc 

 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a 

  sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may in the future be sued by third parties with respect to infringement or other product matters and those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid from time to time we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

  we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies products and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders 

 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

 14 

   

  

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines during fiscal 2009 approximately 80 of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products while a majority of our cash is generated outside the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united sates for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations by efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the current crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection intellectual property and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent as there exists a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions in addition changes in the political environment governmental 

  policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention on environmental controls has continued to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by accidental releases regardless of fault any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

 

new climate change regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for us greenhouse gas legislation has been introduced in massachusetts and the united states legislatures and we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity in the future the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our 375 million senior unsecured notes 

 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we issued in a public offering 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things 

 

  

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the notes which could negatively impact our financial results in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 

  restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

 

our current credit facility and our 50 senior unsecured notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product  

 

in fiscal year 2009 our revenue decreased 22 from fiscal 2008 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 52 our fiscal 2009 cash flow from operations was 4321 million or 21 of revenue we received net proceeds of 3704 million during fiscal 2009 from the issuance of longterm debt and had 1816 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of october 31 2009 

 

the global credit crisis and current economic conditions could continue to result in cautious customer spending behavior we cannot predict the severity duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our 

  future financial results consequently our reported results for the fiscal 2009 may not be indicative of our future results 

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 

 

 

 

 

  

industrial — the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a broadbased decline in demand in this end market which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation automotive and process controls sectors of this end market the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and to a lesser extent the defense sector the revenue growth in these sectors was partially offset by a decline in revenue from products used in automatic test equipment 

 

communications — the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of analog products used in basestations wireless handsets and networking applications the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in communications end market revenue was primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets 

 

consumer — the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment digital cameras and video game applications consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 in consumer end market revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending 

 

computer — the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in computer end market revenue was primarily the result of a general slowdown in the pc market the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of broadbased declines in sales of our products into this end market 

  revenue from onetime ip license — during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded revenue of 35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party 

 

revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

 

  

the decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product categories in every market that we serve particularly the industrial and consumer end markets as a result of an overall decline in the worldwide economy 

 

the increase in revenue from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broadbased increase in sales across many of our product categories the increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets 

  revenue trends by geographic region 

 

the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three fiscal years is as follows 

 

 

 

in fiscal year 2009 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany sweden and france and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are korea taiwan and singapore 

 

in fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2007 the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising “europe” are germany france and the united kingdom and the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and korea 

 

sales declined in all geographic regions in the fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 with sales in europe and japan experiencing the largest decline this decline in sales in europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive end market the decline in sales in japan was principally attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a result of the global economic crisis the decline in china was smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to the strong demand for our products used in china’s recent infrastructure buildout of the country’s next generation of communication technology 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by 560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of 5680 million and reduced operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created adverse utilization variances 

 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of recording revenue in fiscal 2007 of 35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

as of october 31 2009 the total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of income was approximately 1034 million before tax consideration which we will recognize over a weighted average period of 16 years 

 

during fiscal 2009 our shareholders approved and we completed an employee stock option exchange program option exchange the option exchange provided our eligible employees except our named executive officers and directors the opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price or in some instances cash that had approximately the same fair value as the options surrendered 

  see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

research and development or rd expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased 865 million or 16 from fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 

 

rd expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by 239 million or 5 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary benefit and variable compensation expenses which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses 

 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

selling marketing general and administrative or smga expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased 825 million or 20 from fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable compensation expenses 

 

smga expenses increased by 262 million or 7 in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary benefit and variable compensation expenses which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 fiscal 2007 also included 85 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007 

 

special charges 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

 

we ceased production at our california wafer fabrication facility in november 2006 we are paying the lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term which expires in 2010 we completed the cleanup activity during fiscal 2007 and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action 

 

reorganization of product development and support programs 

 

we recorded special charges in fiscal years 2005 2006 and 2007 as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs we terminated the employment of all employees associated with these programs and 

  have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action 

 

consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick 

 

in fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge of 137 million as a result of our decision to only use eightinch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the limerick facility’s sixinch production line have transitioned to our existing eightinch production line in limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with this action as of october 31 2009 we still employed 2 of the 150 employees included in this action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit during fiscal 2008 we recorded an additional charge of 15 million related to this action of which 12 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and 03 million was for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred during fiscal 2009 we recorded additional charges of 12 million for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred the production in the sixinch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action we estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately 25 million per year which we expect to realize starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales of which approximately 1 million relates to noncash depreciation savings 

 

reduction of overhead infrastructure costs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge as a result of our decision to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth in september 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business as a result we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing engineering and smga to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action and have paid all amounts owed to employees for severance we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this action these cost reduction actions which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 resulted in annual savings of approximately 15 million we realized these savings as follows approximately 7 million in rd expenses approximately 6 million in smga expenses and approximately 2 million in cost of sales 

 

reduction of operating costs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in order to further reduce our operating cost structure we recorded a special charge of 16 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and smga employees we terminated the employment of all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts owed to employees for severance as income continuance 

 

during fiscal 2009 we recorded an additional charge of 303 million related to this cost reduction action approximately 21 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 approximately 09 million was for the writeoff of property plant and equipment and approximately 08 million was for contract termination costs and for cleanup and closure costs that were expensed as incurred the remaining 265 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and smga employees as of october 31 2009 we still employed 16 of the 547 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 

 

we believe this cost reduction action which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 will result in annual savings of approximately 364 million once fully implemented we expect these annual savings will be realized as follows approximately 316 million in smga expenses and approximately 

  48 million in cost of sales a portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal year 2009 and the remainder of the savings will be fully reflected in our results by the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in cambridge 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded a special charge of 221 million as a result of our decision to consolidate our cambridge massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our existing wilmington massachusetts facility in connection with the anticipated closure of this facility we evaluated the recoverability of the facilities’ manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment of approximately 129 million based on the revised period of intended use the remaining 92 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded under our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9 smga employees associated with this action 

 

we finished production in the cambridge fabrication facility and began cleanup activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we reversed approximately 18 million of the severance accrual the accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left the company or found alternative employment within the company in addition we recorded a special charge of approximately 17 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future use we also recorded a special charge of 01 million for cleanup costs as we began our cleanup of the cambridge fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as of october 31 2009 we still employed 33 employees included in this action the remaining employees will continue working during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on the cleanup and closure of the wafer fabrication facility these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect to incur additional expenses that cannot be precisely determined at this time related to this action in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for lease termination cleanup and closure costs the lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred 

 

we estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately 41 million per year expected to be fully realized starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect these annual savings to be realized as follows approximately 402 million in cost of sales of which approximately 40 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 08 million in smga expenses 

 

operating income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the 3402 million or 54 decrease in operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of 5680 million a 560 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and an increase of 506 million in special charges this decrease in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in rd and smga expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  

 

the 563 million or 10 increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of 1182 million and to a lesser extent a decrease in special charges of 374 million this increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  and the fact that fiscal 2007 included 35 million in nonproduct revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 

  nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

nonoperating income was lower by 285 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 in addition we incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the issuance of 375 million aggregate principal 50 senior unsecured notes on june 30 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap in june 2009 that swaps the fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 234 as of october 31 2009 

 

nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by 517 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and to a lesser extent lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 in addition other income in fiscal 2007 included 105 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a 79 million gain from the sale of an investment 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our recording special charges of 537 million in fiscal 2009 a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher us tax rate and as a result of a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower rate 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 the 2007 tax rate included the following transactions which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the onetime receipt of 35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party 19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and a 79 million gain on the sale of an investment in addition the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition these items which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate were partially offset by a higher rd credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008 in addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 causing a decrease in our tax rate 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax 

 

 

  income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2009 was lower than in fiscal 2008 by approximately 2778 million primarily as a result of the 3402 million decrease in operating income that was partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2009 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately 231 million primarily as a result of the 563 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a 517 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements 

 

acquisitions 

 

in fiscal 2006 we completed a transaction with ttpcom limited ttpcom whereby ttpcom transferred to us intellectual property engineering resources and related assets associated with the support and customization of ttpcom’s gsmgprsedge modem software for use on our existing and future generations of softfone ® baseband processors we also acquired development rights for ajar ttpcom’s advanced applications platform as a result of this transaction we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers thus improving our ability to service the needs of individual customers during fiscal 2007 we paid 61 million of contingent consideration related to this acquisition 

 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privatelyheld integrant technologies inc integrant of seoul korea the acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened our presence in the asia region we paid 84 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july 2007 through july 2009 we recorded these payments as additional goodwill 

 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired all the outstanding stock of privatelyheld audioasics as audioasics of roskilde denmark the acquisition of audioasics allows us to continue developing lowpower audio solutions while expanding our presence in the nordic and eastern european regions we paid additional cash payments of 31 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenuebased milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009 which were recorded as additional goodwill in addition in accordance with the terms of the acquisition documents we paid 32 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009 which were recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008 all revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisitions have been met and no additional payments will be made 

 

we have not provided pro forma results of operations for ttpcom integrant and audioasics in this report as they were not material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis we included the results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated statement of income from the date of such acquisition 

  liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

at october 31 2009 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1816 million an increase of 5063 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2009 were net cash generated from operating activities of 4321 million and net proceeds of 3704 million from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in june 2009 the principal uses of funds for fiscal 2009 were dividend payments of 2330 million and capital expenditures of 561 million 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented we believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position additionally as a result of these dispositions we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations see note 2u in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these discontinued operations 

 

 

 

 

  

accounts receivable at october 31 2009 decreased 143 million or 5 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the decrease in receivables was the result of lower product shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

inventory at october 31 2009 decreased by 615 million or 20 from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the decrease in inventory despite a lower level of sales is primarily a result of significant reductions in external manufacturing spending and additional factory shutdowns in fiscal 2009 

 

current liabilities decreased to 3866 million at october 31 2009 a decrease of 1824 million or 32 from 5691 million at the end of fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of decreases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent a decrease in income taxes payable as a result of lower profits in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment including discontinued operations were 561 million in fiscal 2009 1574 million in fiscal 2008 and 1418 million in fiscal 2007 we expect fiscal 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million 

 

during fiscal 2009 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 080 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in aggregate dividend payments of 2330 million after the end of the fiscal year on november 19 2009 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 020 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 23 2009 to shareholders of record on december 4 2009 and is expected to total approximately 584 million the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity 

  our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 4 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program as of october 31 2009 we had repurchased a total of approximately 1147 million shares of our common stock for approximately 39084 million under this program and an additional 916 million remains under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook liquidity and the amount of cash we have available to us in the united states 

 

on june 30 2009 we issued 375 million aggregate principal amount of 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the notes with annual interest payments of 50 paid in two installments on january 1 and july 1 of each year commencing january 1 2010 the net proceeds of the offering were 3704 million after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses underwriting discounts and commissions which will be amortized over the term of the notes we swapped the fixed interest portion of these notes for a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 234 as of october 31 2009 the variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly the libor based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to incur create assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to a principal property and consolidate with or merge into or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other party in addition we have a fiveyear 165 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in may 2013 to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance stock repurchases dividend payments acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 

 

at october 31 2009 our principal source of liquidity was 1816 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of october 31 2009 approximately 4127 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations by efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions however we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and purchases of stock if any under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months 

  the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of october 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

as of october 31 2009 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was 262 million which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

  the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of october 31 2009 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

outlook 

 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook made by us 

 

we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to increase to approximately 580 to 585 as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a richer mix of industrial sales we are planning for operating expenses excluding onetime restructuring items associated with the closure of our cambridge wafer fabrication facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to remain approximately flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 in line with our plan to achieve higher operating leverage going forward as a result our plan is for diluted eps from continuing operations to be approximately 036 to 037 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 excluding onetime restructuring items associated with the closure of our cambridge wafer fabrication facility which cannot be precisely determined at this time

in december 2007 the fasb issued asc81010 formerly sfas 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements asc 81010 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and accordingly requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements this topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 which is our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that this rule may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until 

  the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies which requires significant judgment by management if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  accounting for income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

on november 4 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions these principles requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the statement of income determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in our common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

  expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 43 to all unvested stockbased awards as of october 31 2009 the rate of 43 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate exposure 

 

based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of october 31 2009 and november 1 2008 our annual interest income would change by approximately 20 million and 14 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates 

 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of october 31 2009 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 3 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of november 1 2008 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a 2 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

 

in june 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our 375 million 50 senior unsecured notes due july 1 2014 the effect of the swap was to convert our 50 fixed 

  interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the threemonth libor plus 205 234 as of october 31 2009 if libor changes by 100 basis points our annual interest expense would change by 38 million 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 31 2009 and november 1 2008 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge a high proportion of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 31 2009 and november 1 2008 

 

 

 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background 

 

all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control we refer to these manipulations and transformations as “realworld signal processing” 

 

significant developments in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these developments include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions and the widespread application of lowcost highperformance microprocessorbased systems which motivate customers to convert analog information into digital information that can be managed by these microprocessors at the same time the ongoing transition to digital media for communications music photography and video has increased the need for precise highspeed signal conditioning interfaces between the analog world and digital electronics the convergence of computing communications and consumer electronics has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto fewer chips and with less power consumption our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption 

 

principal products 

 

we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our product portfolio are both generalpurpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing more customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications however in some communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion amplification power management radio frequency and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

 

we produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reporting segment our ten highest revenue products in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10 of our revenue for fiscal 2008 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions 

analog products 

 

our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for over four decades and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of highperformance analog ics our analog signal processing ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these products have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components resulting in improved reliability the majority of our analog ic products are proprietary to us in their design and our product portfolio addresses a wide range of applications our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems 

 

we derive the majority of our analog signal processing ic product revenue from sales of data converters and amplifiers we are the industry’s leading supplier of data converter products data converters translate realworld analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals amplifiers are used to condition analog signals and minimize noise the data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 69 of our fiscal 2008 revenue with converters representing 46 and amplifiers representing 23 

 

over the past several years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings along the entire signal chain and into areas such as microelectromechanical systems or mems radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics and power management 

 

our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables us to build extremely small mechanical sensing elements on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems ®  our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration and gyroscopes used to sense position the majority of our current revenue from mems products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications and in video game applications however opportunities from consumer and industrial customers are increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets 

 

our mems and rf products as well as other analog signal processing products such as highspeed clock ics are included in our “other analog” product category which collectively represented 15 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 

 

power management and reference products contributed 6 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 whether the product is plugged into the wall or runs on batteries every electronic device requires some form of power management which can include converters battery chargers charge pumps and regulators we leverage our leading analog signal technology to devise innovative highperformance power management ics highreliability infrastructure equipment and batteryoperated portable medical communications and consumer devices

computer — we currently supply ics used for high fidelity audio in desktop and notebook computers and for power management in server computers our products are also used in computer peripherals such as displays printers and scanners 

 

research and development 

 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of 

existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 533 million during fiscal 2008 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 510 million during fiscal 2007 and approximately 460 million during fiscal 2006 

 

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing conditioning conversion and processing in addition we have been increasing our investment in analog products used for power management in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development at 40 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world 

 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of november 1 2008 we held approximately 1400 us patents and approximately 550 nonprovisional pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets which are akin to the blueprint for building an ic under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 

 

sales channels 

 

we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the internet 

 

we derived approximately 53 of our fiscal 2008 product revenue from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source in all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers we make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter in addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in note 2n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the categorization of sales into geographic regions is based upon the location of the customer 

 

we derived approximately 20 of our fiscal 2008 revenue from customers in the united states and approximately 4 from customers elsewhere in north and south america as of november 1 2008 we had 12 direct sales offices in the united states 

we derived approximately 26 of our fiscal 2008 revenue from customers in europe as of november 1 2008 we had direct sales offices in austria denmark france germany israel italy the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom 

 

we derived approximately 19 of our fiscal 2008 revenue from customers in japan 

 

we derived approximately 16 of our fiscal 2008 revenue from customers in china and approximately 15 from customers elsewhere in asia principally taiwan and korea as of november 1 2008 we had direct sales offices in the asia region in china hong kong india japan korea singapore and taiwan 

 

we also have sales representatives andor distributors in over 40 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

we support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide this information and sell products via our worldwide website on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 

 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 4 of our fiscal 2008 revenue our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 32 of our fiscal 2008 revenue these customers used hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial computer communication and consumer markets 

 

seasonality 

 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors included elsewhere in this report our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

foreign operations 

 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2008 we derived approximately 80 of our revenue from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog dsp mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes approximately 44 43 and 41 of our revenue in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

 

capital spending was 1574 million in fiscal 2008 compared with 1418 million in fiscal 2007 we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 55 million in fiscal 2009 

 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2008 was approximately 333 million down from approximately 396 million at the end of fiscal 2007 we define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders with a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2008 product revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and us government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the us government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is set forth in note 2u note 6 and note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

competition 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive our competitors include broadcom corporation cirrus logic inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc microchip technology inc national semiconductor corporation nxp semiconductors st microelectronics silicon laboratories inc and texas instruments inc 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

environment 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention to reduce our energy consumption and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

in fiscal 2008 we became an applicant member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional environmental compliance obligations compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production alteration of fabrication processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of november 1 2008 we employed approximately 9000 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding 

commitment to purchase all or even any of the product in other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the current crisis in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

as widely reported global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the current tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges the volatility in the credit markets has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products product development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy such customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect such competition to increase in the future many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or 

suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve competition is generally based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and product pricing availability and capacity with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assembly and test services and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields quality assurance and costs additionally we utilize a limited number of thirdparty wafer fabricators primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers approximately 44 of our fiscal 2008 revenue was from products fabricated at thirdparty waferfabrication facilities primarily tsmc 

 

the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and we may not be able to satisfy sufficiently the demand for our products while increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 

 

our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims our customers have on occasion been sued and may 

in the future be sued by third parties with respect to infringement or other product matters and those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them in certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers from time to time we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual 

property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning certain litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected 

 

our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders our current credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios if we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable 

 

acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

 13 

 

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states including in ireland and the philippines during fiscal 2008 approximately 80 of our product revenue was derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products while a majority of our cash is generated outside the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united sates for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations by efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash through borrowings under our current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost our business strategies and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic political and legal risks inherent in international operations including the risks associated with the current crisis in global credit and financial markets ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection intellectual property and environmental compliance trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china’s continuously evolving laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs currency controls environmental regulations and property rights enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent as there exists a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions in addition changes in the political environment governmental policies or uschina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their 

sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

 

our industry is subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process public attention on environmental controls has increased and our customers routinely include stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in potentially costly remediation equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by accidental releases regardless of fault any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

 

new climate change regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for us greenhouse gas legislation has been introduced in massachusetts and the united states legislatures and we expect increased worldwide regulatory activity in the future the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product  

 

in fiscal year 2008 our product revenue increased 6 from fiscal 2007 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 17 we sold two businesses during the year that resulted in net cash proceeds of 403 million and a 248 million net gain in fiscal 2008 we report these two businesses below as discontinued operations our fiscal 2008 cash flow from operations was 669 million or 26 of revenue and we had 1310 million of cash and shortterm investments and no debt as of november 1 2008 

while we achieved good operating results for fiscal 2008 the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand for our products we cannot predict the severity duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our future financial results consequently our reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 may not be indicative of our future results 

 

order rates slowed in late september 2008 and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter which limits our shortterm visibility forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult therefore as more fully described in the outlook section below our operating plan is for revenues to decline approximately 20 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from the amount recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 

 

 

 

 

  

industrial — the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and to a lesser extent the defense sector these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from automatic test equipment the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers 

 

communications — the yeartoyear increases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets the increase in sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers 

 

consumer — the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications advanced television systems and digital home applications 

computer — the yeartoyear decreases from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were primarily the result of broadbased declines in sales of our products into this end market 

 

revenue from onetime ip license — during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded revenue of 35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party 

 

revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

 

  

the increase in sales from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the result of a broadbased increase in sales across many of our product categories the increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets 

 

the significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were the yeartoyear increases in our converters and amplifiers in addition the other analog product category increased primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications the yeartoyear decrease from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in the other dsp product category was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in fiscal 2006 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose dsp products 

revenue trends by geographic region 

 

the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows 

 

 

 

the predominant countries comprising “rest of north and south america” are canada and mexico the predominant countries comprising european operations are germany france and the united kingdom the predominant countries comprising “rest of asia” are taiwan and korea 

 

revenue in the united states declined from 24 to 20 of total revenue over the past three fiscal years this geographic shift of revenue reflects the increased manufacturing activity of our customers in locations outside the united states primarily china and our success in markets located outside of the united states 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2007 gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was higher primarily as a result of recording revenue of 35 million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 

 

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 decreased by 70 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006 this decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics in fiscal 2007 which were primarily manufactured at external foundries where we earned lower gross margins compared to our average gross margin this gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by the 35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately 203 million of restructuringrelated expenses of which 183 million was accelerated depreciation 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 on october 30 2005 we adopted the financial accounting standards board’s statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method we calculate compensation cost on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model as of november 1 2008 the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately 1167 million before tax consideration which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 17 years see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas 123r 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

rd expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by 239 million or 5 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary benefit and bonus expenses which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 and lower employee stock option expenses 

 

rd expenses in fiscal 2007 increased by 497 million or 11 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006 the increase in rd expenses was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007 these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

smga expenses increased by 262 million or 7 in fiscal 2008 as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary benefit and bonus expenses which were partially offset by lower employee stock option expenses and one less week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 fiscal 2007 also included 85 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007 

 

smga expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 55 million or 1 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006 the increase in smga expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an extra week of operations in fiscal 2007 these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses and 85 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in fiscal 2007 

 

purchased inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

we incurred charges totaling 217 million for the writeoff of inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in fiscal 2006 there were no charges for the writeoff of 

inprocess research and development in fiscal 2008 or 2007 see “acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 

 

special charges 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 203 million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in wilmington massachusetts the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that we recorded pursuant to sfas 88 employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees the severance benefit is based on the length of past service and employees had to continue to be employed until their employment was involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

in addition we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006 related to the sunnyvale facility closure which consisted of 183 million of noncash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and 20 million for stayon bonuses for certain employees critical to facilitating the closure of this facility we reversed approximately 20 million of the severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company in addition there was an overaccrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments normally paid as income continuance were paid in lump sum payments which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments we have terminated the employment of all of the employees included in this action 

 

we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november 9 2006 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded additional expense in accordance with sfas 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities or sfas 146 which consisted of 32 million for cleanup and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and 04 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge in accordance with sfas 146 which included 50 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the lease obligation costs are being paid out on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term which expires in 2010 also included in this special charge was 17 million for facility cleanup and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred we completed the cleanup activity during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action 

 

the closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007 these annual savings include approximately 49 million in cost of sales of which approximately 7 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 1 million in smga expenses at current demand levels if this facility were still in operation the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities 

 

reorganization of product development and support programs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 112 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees associated with these programs 

 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded an additional special charge of 38 million related to this reorganization action approximately 15 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the writeoff of property plant and equipment and other items at this facility the remaining 23 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees associated with these programs 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded an additional special charge of 16 million related to this reorganization action approximately 06 million of this charge was for contract termination costs the remaining 10 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees associated with these programs during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded an additional special charge of 34 million related to this reorganization action approximately 32 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees the remaining 02 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we reversed approximately 09 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments 

 

the employment of all employees associated with these programs has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance are being paid out as income continuance we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action these organizational changes which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 have resulted in savings of approximately 30 million per year these annual savings include approximately 17 million in rd expenses approximately 10 million in smga expenses and approximately 3 million in cost of sales as this action was completed during fiscal 2007 a portion of these annual savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2007 and all of the annual savings are reflected in our fiscal 2008 results 

 

fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 special charges 

 

consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge of 137 million as a result of our decision to only use eightinch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the limerick facility’s sixinch production line will transition to our existing eightinch production line in limerick while others will transition to external foundries the charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated with these action as of november 1 2008 126 of the 150 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us we expect production to cease in the sixinch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009 at which time the employment of the remaining affected employees will be terminated these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded an additional charge of 15 million related to this action of which 12 million was an adjustment to our original estimate of the severance costs and 03 million was for cleanup and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred we expect to incur additional cleanup and closure costs related to this action over the next three quarters totaling approximately 15 million in accordance with sfas 146 we will expense these costs as incurred we estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately 25 million per year expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales of which approximately 1 million relates to noncash depreciation savings 

 

reduction of overhead infrastructure costs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth in september 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business as a result we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing engineering and smga to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we 

recorded a special charge of 123 million of which 107 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees associated with this action the remaining 16 million was for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use as of november 1 2008 we still employed 6 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect these cost reduction actions which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 to result in savings of approximately 15 million per year we expect these savings to be realized as follows approximately 7 million in rd expenses approximately 6 million in smga expenses and approximately 2 million in cost of sales a portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2008 

 

fourth quarter of 2008 special charge 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we decided to further reduce the operating cost structure of our company consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded a special charge of 16 million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19 engineering and smga employees as of november 1 2008 we still employed 14 of the 19 employees included in this cost reduction action these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect this cost reduction action which we expect to complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to result in savings of approximately 21 million per year we expect these savings to be realized as follows approximately 05 million in rd expenses and approximately 16 million in smga expenses 

 

operating income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the 563 million or 10 increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of 1182 million and to a lesser extent a decrease in special charges of 374 million this increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  and the fact that fiscal 2007 included 35 million in nonproduct revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 

 

operating income increased by 425 million or 8 in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was the result of a 2146 million increase in revenue which was partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and a 722 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  special charges and purchased inprocess research and development  

 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by 517 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and to a lesser extent lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared 

to fiscal 2007 in addition other income in fiscal 2007 included 105 million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a 79 million gain from the sale of an investment 

 

the 179 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a 79 million gain from the sale of an investment and a 105 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2006 we also recognized a 130 million gain on the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by 290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 the 2007 tax rate included the following transactions which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the onetime receipt of 35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party 19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and the 79 million gain on the sale of an investment in addition the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition these items which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate were partially offset by a higher rd credit in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2008 in addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 causing a decrease in our tax rate 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of 352 million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service or irs examination during fiscal 2006 including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit the increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the onetime receipt of 35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party the gain on the sale of an investment of 79 million and 19 million received from the settlement of litigation in addition we recorded an additional 44 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the irs examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a 56 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of 47 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a 99 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax 

 

 

 

income from continuing operations net of tax in fiscal 2008 was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately 231 million primarily as a result of the 563 million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a 517 million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 2008 

income from continuing operations net of tax was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately 171 million primarily as a result of the 179 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 these items which had the impact of decreasing 2007 income from continuing operations net of tax were partially offset by the 425 million increase in operating income from continuing operations 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 accordingly the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

at november 1 2008 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 13097 million an increase of 2285 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2008 were net cash generated from operating activities of 6694 million 4032 million received from the sale of two businesses and proceeds of 942 million from the exercise of stock options the principal uses of funds during fiscal 2008 were the repurchase of approximately 194 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 5699 million dividend payments of 2225 million and capital expenditures of 1574 million included in the cash flow from operations is 1104 million of tax payments related to the sale of the two businesses under sfas no 95 statement of cash flows all income tax payments are included in determining net cash flow from operating activities but the cash received from the sale of the businesses must be reported as an investing cash inflow 

 

we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented we believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position additionally as a result of these dispositions we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations see note 2u in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these discontinued operations 

 

 

 

 

  

accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by 85 million or 3 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007 this decrease was the result of lower product shipments in the last month of fiscal 2008 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2007 

 

inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by 97 million or 3 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by 7 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2007 this decrease in inventory is primarily the result of lower revenue forecasted for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

current liabilities increased to 5691 million at november 1 2008 an increase of 210 million or 4 from 5481 million at the end of fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of increases in compensation and benefit accruals and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors as a result of our shipments to distributors in fiscal 2008 exceeding the distributors’ sales to their end customers these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment including discontinued operations were 1574 million in fiscal 2008 1418 million in fiscal 2007 and 1293 million in fiscal 2006 we expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to total approximately 55 million 

 

during fiscal 2008 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 076 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of 2225 million the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity after the end of the fiscal year on november 20 2008 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 020 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 24 2008 to shareholders of record on december 5 2008 and is expected to total approximately 582 million 

our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004 in the aggregate the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 4 billion of our common stock under the program under the program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program we repurchased approximately 194 million shares for approximately 5699 million during fiscal 2008 as of november 1 2008 we had repurchased a total of approximately 1145 million shares of our common stock for approximately 39047 million under this program and an additional 954 million remains under the current authorized program the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon the amount of cash we have available to us in the united states 

 

at november 1 2008 our principal source of liquidity was 13097 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of november 1 2008 approximately 890 million of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the united states the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases as a result we entered into a fiveyear 165 million unsecured revolving credit facility in may 2008 in order to supplement our occasional cash requirements in the united states to date we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance stock repurchases dividend payments acquisitions capital expenditures working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 

 

the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions however we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with existing and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures research and development efforts dividend payments if any and purchases of stock if any under our stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november 1 2008 

 

 

 

 

 35 

  

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

as of november 1 2008 our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions under fin 48 was 202 million which are included in “other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k as a result of our adoption of fin 48 due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the noncurrent liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions therefore we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 

 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of november 1 2008 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

outlook 

 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by us 

 

the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand order rates slowed in late september 2008 and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter which limits our shortterm visibility into future revenues forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult our operating plan is for revenue to decline approximately 20 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we are planning to take steps to avoid a large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing output which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points we are therefore planning for gross margin to be approximately 57 to 58 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 depending on the actual product mix and level of sales we achieve further we are planning to take actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 that we expect will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter levels of approximately 10 or 25 million we expect to realize over half of that savings in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as a result of these anticipated actions we plan to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we are currently in the process of finalizing our plans to reduce costs and are unable to determine the amount of the restructuring charge at this point assuming these levels of sales and resulting gross margin anticipated cost reductions and an effective tax rate of 22 we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to be approximately 022 to 023 excluding restructuring charges 

 

we are responding to the current economic environment by taking actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the shortterm while strengthening our position for the longterm we anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions will fluctuate with general economic conditions while the actions related to realigning our product 

portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will result in shortterm savings as well as a lower cost structure while we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the shortterm reduction in our earnings and position ourselves for significant earnings leverage when growth resumes there can be no assurances that market conditions will improve or that our actions will be sufficient to counteract those market conditions 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas 161 sfas 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 161 may have on our financial condition and results of operations the adoption of sfas 161 will change our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 

 

business combinations 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas 141r sfas 141r requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date it further requires that acquisitionrelated costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 which is our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 141r may have on our financial condition and results of operations the adoption of sfas 141r will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 

 

noncontrolling interests 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 160 sfas 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and accordingly requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 which is our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 160 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which is our fiscal year 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

fair value measurements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies 

whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which is our fiscal year 2009 the adoption of sfas 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will not materially impact our financial condition and results of operations the adoption of sfas 157 will expand our disclosures pertaining to the measurement of assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our 

results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

 

goodwill 

 

in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows because we have one reporting segment under sfas 142 we utilize the entitywide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made which in turn may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

on november 4 2007 the first day of our 2008 fiscal year we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 differs from the prior standards in that it requires companies to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in known facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals in the event our assumptions are incorrect the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements determining the amount of stockbased 

compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in the company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 43 to all unvested stockbased awards as of november 1 2008 the rate of 43 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate exposure 

 

based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of november 1 2008 and november 3 2007 our annual interest income would change by approximately 14 million and 9 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates the fair values of our investment portfolio at november 1 2008 and november 3 2007 would each change by approximately 2 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 1 2008 and november 3 2007 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties and limit the financial exposure with any one financial institution while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 

 

the following table illustrates the effect that a 10 unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november 1 2008 and november 3 2007 

 

 

 

the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background 

 

all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “realworld signal processing” 

 

significant developments in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these developments include the ongoing transition to digital media for communications music photography and video which has increased the need for precise highspeed signal conditioning interfaces between the analog world and digital electronics the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions and the widespread application of lowcost highperformance microprocessorbased systems which enables customers to convert analog information into digital information that can be managed by these microprocessors at the same time the convergence of computing communications and consumer electronics has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto fewer chips and with less power consumption our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption 

 

principal products 

 

we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our product portfolio are both generalpurpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing more customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications however in some communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion amplification power management radio frequency and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

 

we produce and market several thousand products our ten highest revenue products in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10 of our revenue for fiscal 2007 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions 

analog products 

 

our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for over four decades and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog signal processing ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these products have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components resulting in improved reliability the majority of our analog signal processing ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers the data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 66 of our fiscal 2007 product revenue over the past several years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings along the entire signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics power management products phase locked loops and highspeed clock ics 

 

the majority of our analog ic products are proprietary to us in their design and our product portfolio addresses a wide range of applications our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems 

 

our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables extremely small mechanical sensing elements to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems ®  our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration and gyroscopes used to sense position the majority of our current revenue from mems products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications and in video game applications however revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets 

 

dsp products 

 

dsps are processors that are optimized for highspeed numeric calculations which are essential for instantaneous or realtime processing of digital data generated in most cases from analog to digital signal conversion dsp product revenue represented 10 of our fiscal 2007 product revenue our dsp products are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs or algorithms associated with processing digitized realtime realworld data programmable dsps provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software we offer both generalpurpose and applicationspecific dsp products generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools that we provide and software development tools they obtain from thirdparty suppliers our applicationspecific dsp products typically include software for applications such as audio processing telecommunications or image processing our dsps are designed in families of products that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same software we support these products with easytouse lowcost development tools which are designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs and timetomarket

patents and other intellectual property rights 

 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of november 3 2007 we held approximately 1388 us patents and approximately 488 nonprovisional pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction in connection with our announced divestiture transactions expected to close in fiscal 2008 we will transfer ownership of approximately 73 us patents and 60 nonprovisional pending us patent applications while our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets which are akin to the blueprint for building an ic under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 

 

there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants wafer foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests moreover the laws of countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

sales channels 

 

we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the internet 

 

approximately 53 of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was derived from sales made through distributors revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell our products to the end customer known as “100 sell out” or “100 sell through” in the industry these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors 

for their inventory of our products including limited product return privileges and protection against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter are sometimes lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors included elsewhere in this report our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

foreign operations 

 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of our product revenue was derived from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

 

we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial 

complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual property trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor or cmos wafer fabrication processes 

 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 

 

capital spending including that related to our baseband chipset business which is reflected as a discontinued operation was 1418 million in fiscal 2007 compared with 1293 million in fiscal 2006 we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 160 million in fiscal 2008 

 

our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc if tsmc or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2007 was approximately 408 million up from approximately 376 million at the end of fiscal 2006 this backlog includes approximately 14 million and 10 million at november 3 2007 and october 28 2006 respectively from our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business that will be reclassified in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to discontinued operations additional information relating to this divestiture is set forth below under the heading acquisitions divestitures and investments we define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer or distributor requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be cancelled or deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

 

in september 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc we will also license to mediatek inc related technology and intellectual property rights subject to certain field of use restrictions we expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

in november 2007 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation or on to sell our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business the business to be sold consists of core voltage regulator products for the cpu in computing and gaming applications and temperature sensors and fanspeed controllers for managing the temperature of the cpu as part of the transition we also agreed to enter into a oneyear manufacturing supply arrangement with on we expect to close this transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 this business met the assets held for sale criteria on november 8 2007 and will therefore be accounted for as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

additional information relating to our disposition and acquisition activities during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is set forth in note 2u and note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

competition 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance analog and mixedsignal processing components competitors for our analog and dsp products include broadcom corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp semiconductors st microelectronics silicon laboratories inc and texas instruments inc 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products product price customer service and technical support we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better 

established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

environment 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to the storage handling use discharge and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in fines suspension of production alteration of fabrication processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of november 3 2007 we employed approximately 9600 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue gross margins operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue gross margins operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory 

writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve our products develop and market new products and identify and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market new products product development and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy such customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve competition is based on design and quality of products product performance features and functionality and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assembly and test services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields quality assurance and costs additionally we utilize a limited number of thirdparty wafer fabricators primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications we have no written supply agreements with these suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to 

engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 

 

we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly during these periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect our operating results may be adversely affected these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 

 

our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 

 

we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase should customer demand fail to increase or should we enter a period of reduced customer demand our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 

 

our semiconductor products are complex and may contain undetected defects which could result in significant costs claims and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products 

 

semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain undetected defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed we invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls if any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to 

develop similar technology independently or design around our patents other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products services or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation including regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards while we maintain product liability insurance there can be no assurance that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers’ products containing one of our products see note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning certain pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies or purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products and services or enhance our existing products and services 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory approvals in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money we may not be able to 

find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common stockholders acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

  

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or third party waferfabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of electric power or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of our product revenue was derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual property trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of 

credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results 

 

our industry is subject to environmental regulations that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals used in the manufacturing process public attention on environmental controls has increased and changes in environmental regulations might require us to invest in costly remediation equipment or alter the way our products are made in addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of liability for damages caused by accidental releases regardless of fault any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 

 

our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

tentative settlement of the sec’s previously announced stock option investigation 

 

in our 2004 form 10k filing we disclosed that the securities and exchange commission or sec had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results on november 15 2005 we announced that we had reached a tentative settlement with the sec 

 

at all times since receiving notice of this inquiry we have cooperated with the sec in november 2005 we and our president and ceo mr jerald g fishman made an offer of settlement to the staff of the sec the settlement has been submitted to the commission for approval there can be no assurance a final settlement will be so approved 

 

the sec’s inquiry focused on two separate issues the first issue concerned our disclosure regarding grants of options to employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results specifically the issue related to options granted to our employees  including officers  on november 30 1999 and to our employees  including officers  and directors on november 10 2000 

 

the second issue concerned the grant dates for options granted to employees  including officers  in 1998 and 1999 and the grant date for options granted to employees including officers  and directors in 2001 specifically the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the september 4 1998 options should have been september 8th which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options the appropriate grant date for the november 30 1999 options should have been november 29th which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used and the appropriate grant date for the july 18 2001 options should have been july 26th which is five trading days after the original date 

 

in connection with the proposed settlement we would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under section 10b of the securities exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder would pay a civil money penalty of 3 million and would reprice options granted to mr fishman in certain years options granted to all others would be excluded from the repricing mr fishman would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under sections 17a2 and 3 of the securities act would pay a civil money penalty of 1 million and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years with the exception of options granted in 1998 mr fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter we and mr fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the commission’s findings 

 

we have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement 

 

other legal proceedings 

 

in may 2006 we received a document subpoena from the us attorney for the southern district of new york requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to our granting of stock options we believe that the options at issue in this matter are the same option grants which have been the subject of investigation by the sec we have cooperated with the office of the us attorney in connection with this subpoena we cannot predict the outcome of this matter but believe the disposition of the matter will not have a material adverse effect on us or our financial position 

 

on may 25 2006 we filed a lawsuit in united states district court for the district of delaware against linear technology corp or ltc alleging infringement of three of our patents by ltc’s making selling and using various products in our complaint we are seeking damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief in addition we also sought a declaratory judgment that our products do not infringe eight patents allegedly owned by ltc the “ltc patents” and that the ltc patents are invalid on july 28 2006 ltc filed an answer and counterclaims denying that its products infringe the asserted patents and asking the court to declare such patents invalid ltc also claimed that we by making selling and using various power management products are infringing seven of the eight ltc patents ltc seeks damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief on august 21 2006 we filed our answer to ltc’s counterclaims denying all liability to ltc the case is currently in the discovery phase and trial is 

scheduled to begin in october 2008 we intend to vigorously pursue our claims against ltc and to vigorously defend against ltc’s counterclaims we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this litigation however we believe that the final disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on us or our financial position 

 

on october 13 2006 a purported class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on behalf of participants in our investment partnership plan from october 5 2000 to the present the complaint named as defendants us certain officers and directors and our investment partnership plan administration committee the complaint alleges purported violations of federal law in connection with our option granting practices during the years 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 including breaches of fiduciary duties owed to participants and beneficiaries of our investment partnership plan under the employee retirement income security act the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages as well as equitable and injunctive relief we intend to vigorously defend against these allegations on november 22 2006 we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on january 8 2007 the plaintiff filed memoranda in opposition on january 22 2007 we and the individual defendants filed further memoranda in support of the motions to dismiss although we believe we have meritorious defenses to the asserted claims we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this proceeding the court has scheduled a hearing on our motion to dismiss on january 30 2008 

 

from time to time in the ordinary course of our business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes as to such claims and litigation we can give no assurance that we will prevail 

 

while we do not believe that any of the matters described above will have a material adverse effect on our financial position an adverse outcome of any of these matters is possible and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

the yeartoyear revenue changes by end market and product category is more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product  

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time when this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each end market 

 

 

 

industrial — the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was a result of a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market 

 

communications — the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of an increase in sales to customers in the wireless basestation and analog wireless handset end markets the increase in sales in these end markets was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was the result of an increase in sales of our products sold to customers in the wireless basestation end market and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of our products sold into optical applications these increases were offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers as a result of the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

consumer — the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications advanced television systems and digital home applications the yeartoyear increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and advanced television systems and to a lesser extent in a broad array of audio and video applications 

 

computer — the yeartoyear decreases in each of the last two fiscal years was the result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers 

 

revenue from onetime ip license — during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded revenue of 35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party 

 

revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes revenue by product categories the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between 

product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

the significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 were the yeartoyear increases in our other analog product category primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications and continued growth in converters and amplifiers sales of products in the power management and reference product category were lower in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers the yeartoyear declines from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 in the dsp product category were primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose dsp products 

 

revenue trends by geographic region 

 

the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

there was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

gross margin 

 

 

 

gross margin in fiscal 2007 decreased by 20 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006 this decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics which currently earn relatively lower gross margins than our average gross margin this decrease was partially offset by the 35 million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included approximately 203 million of restructuringrelated expenses of which 183 million was accelerated depreciation 

 

gross margin in fiscal 2006 decreased by 10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2005 this decrease was the result of recognizing 293 million of stockbased compensation expense restructuringrelated and acquisitionrelated expenses in cost of sales in fiscal 2006 the restructuring expense primarily related to accelerated depreciation of 183 million these increases in expenses were partially offset by an increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 on october 30 2005 we adopted the financial accounting standards board’s statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions one of the key assumptions is expected volatility for options granted prior to fiscal 2005 we used historical volatility to estimate the grantdate fair value of stock options we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several thirdparty advisors we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we accounted for sharebased payments to employees under apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the intrinsic value method and as such generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options the adoption of sfas 123r under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that were unvested on the effective date under the modified prospective application method prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas 123r we used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of sfas 123r upon adoption of sfas 123r on october 30 2005 we switched to the straightline attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after october 29 2005 the expense associated with the unvested portion of the preadoption grants continues to be expensed using the graded attribution method 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r on october 18 2005 we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after december 31 2000 that had exercise prices of 4000 per share or greater the vesting of options issued to our corporate officers and directors was not accelerated unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration because the exercise 

price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification no stockbased compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 25 the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these outofthemoney stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized noncash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  because the approximately 188 million 134 million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification 

 

our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 are 670 million and 473 million lower respectively than if we had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 were 015 and 014 lower respectively than if we had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 we expect that stockbased compensation related to our adoption of sfas 123r will reduce diluted eps by approximately 003 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

our income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 were 698 million and 497 million lower respectively than if we had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2006 were 014 and 013 lower respectively than if we had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 

 

as of november 3 2007 the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately 1445 million before tax consideration which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 17 years 

 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas 123r 

 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 499 million or 11 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2006 the increase in rd expense was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal 2007 these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by 312 million or 7 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase in rd expense in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of recognizing 296 million of stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas 123r and an increase in employee bonus expense these increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

rd expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

smga expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 53 million or 1 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2006 the increase in smga expenses was primarily the result of higher employee salary and benefit expense and an extra week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense and 85 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of litigation in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

smga expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by 548 million or 16 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase in smga expenses was primarily the result of recording 326 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas 123r and higher employee salary benefit and bonus expenses these increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

purchased inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

we incurred charges totaling 217 million for the writeoff of inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 there were no charges for the writeoff of inprocess research and development in fiscal 2007 or 2005 see “acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 

 

special charges 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 203 million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in wilmington massachusetts the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas 88 employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees the severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service and employees had to continue to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006 which consisted of 183 million of noncash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and 20 million for stayon bonuses we reversed approximately 20 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the company other employees found alternative employment within the company and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments normally paid as income continuance were paid in lump sum payments which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments we have terminated the employment of all of the remaining employees included in this action 

we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november 9 2006 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded additional expense in accordance with sfas 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which consisted of 32 million for cleanup and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and 04 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge in accordance with sfas 146 which included 50 million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 also included in this special charge was 17 million for cleanup and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred the cleanup activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action 

 

the closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately 50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007 these annual savings include approximately 49 million in cost of sales of which approximately 7 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 1 million in smga expenses at current demand levels if this facility were still in operation the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities 

 

reorganization of product development and support programs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 112 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees 

 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded an additional special charge of 38 million related to this reorganization action approximately 15 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the writeoff of property plant and equipment and other items at this facility the remaining 23 million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded an additional special charge of 16 million related to this reorganization action approximately 06 million of this charge was for contract termination costs the remaining 10 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded an additional special charge of 34 million related to this reorganization action approximately 32 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees the remaining 02 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we reversed approximately 09 million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments 

 

the employment of all employees included in this action has been terminated we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action these organizational changes which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 are expected to result in savings of approximately 30 million per year these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 17 million in rd expenses approximately 10 million in smga expenses and approximately 3 million in cost of sales a portion of these savings associated with these charges is reflected in our fiscal 2007 results 

fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 special charges 

 

consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a special charge of 137 million as a result of our decision to focus the wafer fabrication capacity at our limerick facility on eightinch technology certain manufacturing processes and products produced on our sixinch production line will transition to our existing eightinch production line in limerick while others will transition to external foundries the charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees production is expected to cease in the sixinch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of 2009 and the affected employees will be terminated these employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal year 2009 of approximately 6 million related to cleanup and closure costs in accordance with sfas 146 these costs will be expensed as incurred the closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately 25 million per year expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 these annual savings will be in cost of sales of which approximately 1 million relates to noncash depreciation savings 

 

reduction of overhead infrastructure costs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth in september 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business as a result of these decisions we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing engineering and smga to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure consequently we recorded a special charge of 123 million of which 107 million is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees the remaining 16 million is for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use as of november 3 2007 77 of the 152 employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us these employees must continue to be employed until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit these cost reduction actions are expected to result in savings of approximately 15 million per year once substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 7 million in rd expenses approximately 6 million in smga expenses and approximately 2 million in cost of sales 

 

operating income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

operating income increased by 438 million or 8 in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was the result of a 2032 million increase in revenue which was offset by a 02 reduction in gross margin percentage and a 723 million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling marketing general and administrative  special charges and purchased inprocess research and development  

 

the 438 million or 9 increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of a 10 increase in revenue this increase was partially offset by 698 million of stockbased operating expenses associated with the adoption of sfas 123r and the 217 million writeoff of purchased inprocess research and development as a result of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions in addition the special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by 297 million than the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

the 179 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a 79 million gain from the sale of an investment and a 105 million settlement we received in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2006 we also recognized a 130 million gain on the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line 

 

nonoperating income increased by 389 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily the result of higher interest income which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 nonoperating income for fiscal 2006 also included a 130 million gain on the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of 352 million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service or irs examination during fiscal 2006 including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit the increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007 transactions which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the onetime receipt of 35 million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party the gain on the sale of an investment of 79 million and the 19 million received from the settlement of litigation in addition we recorded an additional 44 million of taxes and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to the irs examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a 56 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of 47 million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in fiscal 2007 and a 99 million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal 2006 results 

 

the tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of 352 million associated with the completion of an irs examination during fiscal 2006 including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit in addition the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the writeoff of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below 

 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 or the ajca was signed into law the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations during fiscal 2005 we repatriated 1055 million of accumulated foreign earnings taking the benefit of current tax law allowing for earnings repatriated prior to october 29 2005 to be taxed at a reduced effective tax rate in connection with the repatriation of earnings we recorded additional income tax expense of 49 million in fiscal 2005 

we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices inc deferred compensation plan or the deferred compensation plan while they were still subject to the 162m limitation and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal generally upon their retirement due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the ajca the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans changed in fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162m limitation withdrew or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan as a result we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of 72 million due to the writeoff of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan 

 

net income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

net income from continuing operations was lower in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately 156 million primarily as a result of the 179 million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 partially offset by the 438 million increase in operating income from continuing operations 

 

net income from continuing operations increased by 1404 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily as the result of the 10 increase in revenue the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense this increase in net income was partially offset by a yeartoyear increase in operating expenses of 780 million primarily as a result of 622 million of stockbased operating expenses related to the adoption of sfas 123r and 222 million of operating expenses related to our acquisitions during fiscal 2006 these operating expense increases were partially offset by a 297 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

discontinued operations 

 

 

 

we entered into a definitive agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to sell our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc accordingly these operations have been presented as a discontinued operation within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144  we expect to record a gain from the sale of this business upon the completion of the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimate this gain after taxes will be in the range of 150 million to 160 million

related party transaction 

 

one of our directors who has served on our board of directors since 1988 became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of tsmc management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from tsmc are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the board of directors of tsmc we purchased approximately 302 million 281 million and 224 million of products from tsmc in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively approximately 47 million and 17 million were payable to tsmc as of november 3 2007 and october 28 2006 respectively we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year 2008 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

at november 3 2007 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 10812 million a decrease of 10471 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2007 were net cash generated from operating activities of 8204 million and proceeds of 1091 million from our employee stock plans the principal uses of funds during fiscal 2007 were the repurchase of approximately 459 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 16472 million dividend payments of 2283 million and capital expenditures of 1418 million 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc the cash flows from this discontinued operation have been combined with the operating investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented we believe the absence of the cash flows from this discontinued operation will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position additionally as a result of this agreement we reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to this business to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations see note 2u to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding this discontinued operation 

 

the anticipated closure of the sale of our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and the anticipated closure of the sale of our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to on semiconductor 

corporation are expected to generate approximately 250 million to 270 million of cash in fiscal 2008 after the payment of all applicable taxes 

 

 

 

 

  

accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2007 increased by 306 million or 10 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006 this increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of fiscal 2007 as compared to the last month of fiscal 2006 

 

inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by 154 million or 4 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by 15 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2006 the decrease in inventory is a result of our continued effort to balance production demand and inventory levels as well as the sale of inventory valued at approximately 19 million at october 28 2006 which had been built during fiscal 2006 in anticipation of the closure of the sunnyvale california wafer fabrication facility 

 

current liabilities increased to 5481 million at november 3 2007 an increase of 572 million or 116 from 4909 million at the end of fiscal 2006 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment including that related to our baseband chipset business which is reflected as a discontinued operation were 1418 million in fiscal 2007 1293 million in fiscal 2006 and 855 million in fiscal 2005 fiscal 2008 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 160 million 

 

during fiscal 2007 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 070 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of 2283 million in fiscal 2007 the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity after the end of the fiscal year on november 26 2007 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 018 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 26 2007 to shareholders of record on december 7 2007 and is expected to total approximately 54 million 

 

on may 11 2005 our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august 11 2004 from 500 million to 1 billion on march 14 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional 1 billion of our common stock increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from 1 billion to 2 billion of our common stock on december 6 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional 1 billion of our common stock increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from 2 billion to 3 billion on june 6 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional 1 billion of our common stock increasing the total amount of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase from 3 billion to 4 billion under the repurchase program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program during fiscal 2007 we repurchased approximately 16472 million of our common stock under this plan as of november 3 2007 we had 6652 million of authorized repurchases remaining under our repurchase program we plan to continue to repurchase shares during fiscal 2008 the timing and number of shares repurchased can not be reasonably estimated at this time however from the end of fiscal year 2007 through november 26 2007 we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for approximately 151 million 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of november 3 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 

 

at november 3 2007 our principal source of liquidity was 10812 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of november 3 2007 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

outlook 

 

the following statements are based on current expectations these statements are forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially unless specifically mentioned these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report these statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by the company upon entering into the definitive agreement to sell our cpu voltage regulator and pc thermal monitoring 

business on november 8 2007 the assets of this business met the heldforsale criteria and will therefore be reclassified as discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 this business generated approximately 25 million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 therefore once we reclassify the 25 million of revenue to discontinued operations our fourth quarter revenue will be 623 million on this basis we expect product sales from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to be approximately 610 million to 635 million gross margin percentage is planned to be up slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 diluted eps is planned to be approximately 038 to 042 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

as previously announced we also expect to close on the sales of two businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the estimated gains on these sales are not reflected in the estimates above we expect to realize a gain net of tax of between approximately 150 million and 160 million related to the sale of our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc we also expect to recognize a gain net of taxes of between approximately 52 million and 60 million related to the sale of our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business the gains on both of these sales will be included in income from discontinued operations 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities 

 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on november 2 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 159 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

fair value measurements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities the standard also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on november 2 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas 157 may have on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

accounting for prior year misstatements 

 

in september 2006 the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment sab 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company’s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures sab 108 permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november 15 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings additionally the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose the adoption of sab 108 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur it also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers’ fiscal year sfas 158 was effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007 except for the change in measurement date which is effective for us in fiscal 2009 the adoption of sfas 158 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that fin 48 may have on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

 

goodwill 

 

in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows because we have one reporting segment under sfas 142 we utilize the entitywide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly at november 3 2007 we had gross deferred tax assets of 2109 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a 468 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

stockbased compensation 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 required that stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility for options granted prior to fiscal 2005 we used historical volatility to estimate the grantdate fair value of stock options we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted for fiscal 2005 and thereafter from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several thirdparty advisors historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time when our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior and as such we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that 1 options in the company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges 2 the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options 3 the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee share options and 4 the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 

 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grantdate valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 43 to all unvested stockbased awards as of november 3 2007 the rate of 43 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period this analysis is reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent 

liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations see note 12 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies

interest rate exposure 

 

based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of november 3 2007 and october 28 2006 our annual interest income would change by approximately 9 million and 16 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates the fair values of our investment portfolio at november 3 2007 and october 28 2006 would change by approximately 2 million and 6 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months the fair values of these instruments were approximately 7 million at november 3 2007 and were insignificant at october 28 2006 currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 3 2007 and october 28 2006 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for contracts outstanding at november 3 2007 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2007 fiscal year end would increase the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments by approximately 24 million and a 10 favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would decrease their fair value by approximately 9 million as at october 28 2006 a 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our 2006 fiscal year end would not expose us to significant gains or losses in the contracts’ fair values the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background 

 

all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “realworld signal processing” within the signal chain 

 

significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions the widespread application of lowcost highperformance microprocessorbased systems and the ongoing transition to digital media for communications music photography and video has increased the need for precise highspeed signal conditioning interfaces between the analog world and digital electronics at the same time the convergence of computing and communications has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption 

 

principal products 

 

we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our signal processing ics are both generalpurpose standard products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing more customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications however in some communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in analog and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

 

we produce and market several thousand products our ten highest revenue products in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10 of our revenue for fiscal 2006 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions 

 

analog products 

 

our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for four decades and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these products have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components resulting in improved reliability the majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers the data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 61 of our fiscal 2006 revenue over the past several years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into 

product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics and power management products such as voltage regulators and thermal monitoring ics phase locked loops and highspeed clock ics 

 

the majority of our analog ic products are proprietary to us in their design and our product portfolio addresses a wide range of applications our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems 

 

our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables extremely small mechanical sensing elements to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems ®  our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration and gyroscopes used to sense position the majority of our current revenue from mems products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications however revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets 

 

dsp products 

 

dsps are processors that are optimized for highspeed numeric calculations which are essential for instantaneous or realtime processing of digital data generated in most cases from analog to digital signal conversion our dsp products are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs or algorithms associated with processing digitized realtime realworld data programmable dsps provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively in software we offer both generalpurpose and applicationspecific dsp products generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools that we provide and software development tools they obtain from thirdparty suppliers our applicationspecific dsp products typically include analog and dsp technology and the dsps are preprogrammed to execute software for applications such as wireless telecommunications or image processing our dsps are designed in families of products that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same software we support these products with easytouse lowcost development tools which reduce our customers’ product development costs and timetomarket 

 

we also have the capability to combine our analog and digital signal processing technology into multifunction mixedsignal devices and chipsets the growing technological demands associated with the use of audio and video in computers and consumer products as well as the networking of communications systems has created new opportunities for these mixedsignal products

research and development 

 

our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 537 million during fiscal 2006 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 497 million during fiscal 2005 and approximately 514 million during fiscal 2004 

 

our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing conditioning conversion and processing in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development at over 30 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries as of october 28 2006 we held 1202 us patents and had 513 nonprovisional pending us patent applications there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction while our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets which are akin to the blueprint for building an ic under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 

 

there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants wafer foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests moreover the laws of countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 13 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

sales channels 

 

we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the internet 

 

approximately 51 of our fiscal 2006 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell our products to the end customer known as “100 sell out” or “100 sell through” in the industry these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products including limited product return privileges and protection against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued 

approximately 25 of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to customers in north america as of october 28 2006 we had 11 direct sales offices in the united states 

 

approximately 22 of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to customers in europe as of october 28 2006 we had direct sales offices in austria belgium denmark finland france germany israel italy the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom 

 

approximately 19 of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to customers in japan approximately 13 of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to customers in china and approximately 21 were to customers elsewhere in asia principally taiwan and korea as of october 28 2006 we had direct sales offices in the asia region in china hong kong india japan korea singapore and taiwan 

 

we also have sales representatives andor distributors in over 45 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding revenue and financial information about geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength databooks product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide website on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 

 

we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 3 of our fiscal 2006 net sales and our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 29 of our fiscal 2006 net sales 

 

seasonality 

 

sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter are sometimes lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season in general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations in addition as explained in our risk factors our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry 

 

foreign operations 

 

through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2006 approximately 75 of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

 

we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual property trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

production and raw materials 

 

monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

 

we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and cmos wafer fabrication processes 

 

our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts and limerick ireland we also operate test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products on november 9 2006 we closed our sunnyvale california wafer fabrication facility and transferred virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in wilmington massachusetts 

 

capital spending in fiscal 2006 was 1293 million compared with 855 million in fiscal 2005 we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 175 million in fiscal 2007 

 

our products require a wide variety of components and raw materials most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases are from solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

 

backlog 

 

backlog at the end of fiscal 2006 was approximately 390 million up from approximately 356 million at the end of fiscal 2005 we define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer or distributor requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

 

in some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 

government contracts 

 

we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2006 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business 

 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed the sale to ikanos communications inc of our dspbased digital subscriber line dsl applicationspecific integrated circuit asic and network processor product line 

 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed a transaction with ttpcom limited ttpcom whereby ttpcom transferred to us intellectual property engineering resources and related assets associated with the support and customization of ttpcom’s gsmgprsedge modem software for use on our existing and future generations of softfone ® baseband processors as a result we became the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of privately held integrant technologies inc an innovator in the field of highperformance analog circuits designed for reconfigurable radio frequency rf signal processing and a leading supplier of lowpower radio tuners that allow mobile communications computer and consumer devices to receive digital television tv and digital radio broadcasts 

 

also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we acquired privately held audioasics as a developer of highperformance lowpower microphone and audio signal conditioning technology resulting in miniature lowpower audio solutions that provide better sound quality in portable consumer and communications products such as mp3 players wireless cellular phones and pdas 

 

competition 

 

we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance analog and mixedsignal processing components competitors for our analog and dsp products include broadcom corporation cirrus logic inc infineon technologies intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp semiconductors st microelectronics and texas instruments inc sales of our micromachined products currently consist of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes and our main competitors in that market are bosch denso corporation freescale semiconductor inc panasonic st microelectronics systron donner and vti technologies 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products product price customer service and technical support we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

environment 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to the storage handling use discharge and disposal of certain chemicals gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position there can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us for example restrictions adopted by the european union regarding the use of hazardous substances have recently become applicable requiring us to transition the manufacturing process for over 9000 of our products any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in fines suspension of production alteration of fabrication processes and legal liability 

 

employees 

 

as of october 28 2006 we employed approximately 9800 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

 

our future revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

 

our future revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors competitive pricing pressures fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity the risk that our backlog could decline significantly the timing delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory our ability to hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers changes in product or customer mix potential significant litigationrelated costs the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets and the effects of public health emergencies natural disasters terrorist activities international conflicts and other events beyond our control in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis in addition if our revenue and operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline 

 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve our products develop and market new products and enter new markets 

 

our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market new products product development and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs in addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy any inability to satisfy such quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or 

that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk 

 

we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future 

 

many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have some of our competitors may have better established supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our markets with enhanced features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assemblytest services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

 

we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields quality assurance and costs additionally we utilize thirdparty wafer fabricators as solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications we have no written supply agreements with these solesource suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders in addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 

 

we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 

 

the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly during these periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand in addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect our operating results may be adversely affected these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 

 

our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 

 

we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose our technologies and processes moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

 

there can no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented as such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available if our patents do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products services or technology without our authorization also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 

 

we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 13 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning certain pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

to remain competitive we may need to acquire other companies or purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products and services or enhance our existing products and services 

 

an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory approvals in order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common stockholders acquisitions also involve a number of risks including 

 

  

if we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

 

we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or third party waferfabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of electric power or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are exposed to business economic political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

 

during fiscal 2006 approximately 75 of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases particularly in the united states and china as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies other business risks associated with international operations include increased managerial complexities air transportation disruptions expropriation currency 

controls currency exchange rate movement additional costs related to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rate increases exposure to different business practices and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual property trade and travel restrictions pandemics import and export license requirements and restrictions difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations and accounts receivable collections 

 

our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives 

 

a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 

 

we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

 

our stock price may be volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by the following factors 

 

  

the stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

tentative settlement of the sec’s previously announced stock option investigation 

 

in the company’s form 10k filing dated november 30 2004 the company disclosed that the securities and exchange commission sec had initiated an inquiry into its stock option granting practices focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results on november 15 2005 the company announced that it had reached a tentative settlement with the sec 

 

since receiving notice of this inquiry the company has cooperated with the sec the company and its president and ceo mr jerald g fishman have made an offer of settlement to the staff of the sec which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the sec’s administrative order and other settlement documents the sec staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the commission a final settlement is subject to review and approval by the commission 

 

the contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues the first issue concerns the company’s disclosure regarding grants of options to employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results specifically the issue relates to options granted to employees  including officers  of the company on november 30 1999 and to employees  including officers  and directors of the company on november 10 2000 the sec settlement would conclude that the company should have made disclosures in its proxy filings to the effect that the company priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results 

 

the second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to employees  including officers  in 1998 and 1999 and the grant date for options granted to employees including officers  and directors in 2001 specifically the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the september 4 1998 options should have been september 8th which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options the appropriate grant date for the november 30 1999 options should have been november 29th which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used and the appropriate grant date for the july 18 2001 options should have been july 26th which is five trading days after the original date 

 

in connection with the contemplated settlement the company would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under section 10b of the securities exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder would pay a civil money penalty of 3 million and would reprice options granted to mr fishman and other directors in certain years options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing mr fishman would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under sections 17a2 and 3 of the securities act would pay a civil money penalty of 1 million and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years with the exception of options granted in 1998 mr fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter the company and mr fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the commission’s findings 

 

the company has determined that no restatement of its historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998 1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005 based on the materiality guidelines contained in sab 99 if a stockbased compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees including officers and directors the net income of the company for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by 218 million in total during this period the company earned cumulative net income of over 25 billion there would be no impact on revenue cash flow from operations or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates the impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows fiscal 1998 02 million fiscal 1999 14 million fiscal 2000 18 million fiscal 2001 37 million fiscal 2002 81 million fiscal 2003 61 million fiscal 2004 05 million

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

 

 

net sales increased 1844 million or 8 in fiscal 2006 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2006 was offset by the impact of a 41 million decrease in sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of the loss of sales from our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 net sales declined 245 million or 9 in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 

 

revenue trends by end market 

 

the categorization of sales by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product the “sold to” customer information the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve the categorization of products by end market can vary over time and when 

this occurs we reclassify sales by end market for prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing or the underlying trends of results within each end market 

 

 

 

industrial  — revenue from products sold into the industrial end market which includes factory automation scientific and medical instrumentation semiconductor automatic test equipment ate defense electronics and automotive applications increased 15 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase reflects a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market the industrial end market represented approximately 42 of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 sales to customers in the industrial end market decreased 1 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 as a result of a decline in revenues from our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005 the industrial end market represented approximately 39 and 36 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

computer  — revenue from products sold into the computer end market declined 10 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the decline was primarily the result of refocusing our power management portfolio lower sales of our personal computer audio codecs and an overall slow down in the personal computer market the computer end market represented approximately 12 of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 revenue from products sold into the computer end market decreased 11 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the computer end market represented approximately 14 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 

 

communications  — revenue from products sold into the communications end market increased 2 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of an increase in sales of our products used in basestations these increases were offset by decreases in wireless handset revenue and decreases in sales to networking customers the sales decline attributable to networking customers was approximately 41 million and was the result of the loss of sales from our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 the communications end market represented approximately 29 of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 revenue from products sold into the communications end market declined 23 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 the decline was primarily the result of a significant decline in revenues from wireless handset customers in fiscal 2005 the communications end market represented approximately 31 and 37 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

consumer  — revenue from products sold into the consumer end market increased 16 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and to a lesser extent in digital cameras and a broad array of audio and video applications the consumer end market represented approximately 17 of our total revenue in fiscal 2006 revenue from sales in the consumer end market increased 9 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 the consumer end market represented approximately 16 and 13 of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively 

revenue trends by product 

 

the following table summarizes sales trends by product categories showing what proportion of our total sales are represented by each product category as well as the annual sequential growth rates for each product category the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing or the underlying trends of results within each product category 

 

 

 

 

 25 

the sharp reduction in sales of dspbased dsl asic and network processor products was a result of our decision to sell this product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 the wireless handset chipset sales are characterized by high sales volumes in periods of significant growth followed by periods of sales declines as demand for our product declines or shifts to our competition 

 

revenue trends by geographic region 

 

the percentage of sales by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows 

 

 

 

there was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the percentage of our net sales in china as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets 

 

gross margin 

 

 

 

the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily related to the increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 these increases were partially offset by stockbased compensation expense and restructuring related expenses primarily accelerated depreciation of 183 million included in cost of sales during fiscal 2006 gross margin included an aggregate 303 million of stockbased compensation expense restructuringrelated and acquisitionrelated expenses in fiscal 2006 

 

gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2004 the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production in fiscal 2005 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 on october 30 2005 we adopted the financial accounting standards board’s statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas 123r using the modified prospective application method compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the blackscholes valuation model the blackscholes valuation model requires us to make several assumptions one of the key assumptions is expected volatility for options granted prior to fiscal 2005 we used historical volatility to estimate the grantdate fair value of stock options we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several thirdparty advisors we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of future volatility historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior 

as a result of adopting sfas 123r on october 30 2005 the company’s income before income taxes and net income for fiscal 2006 are 739 million and 526 million lower respectively than if it had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended october 28 2006 are 015 and 014 lower respectively than if the company had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb opinion 25 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we accounted for sharebased payments to employees under apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the intrinsic value method and as such generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options the adoption of sfas 123r under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date under the modified prospective application method prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas 123r we used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of sfas 123r upon adoption of sfas 123r on october 30 2005 we switched to the straightline attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after october 29 2005 the expense associated with the unvested portion of the preadoption grants will continue to be expensed using the graded attribution method 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas 123r on october 18 2005 we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after december 31 2000 that had exercise prices of 4000 per share or greater options issued to our corporate officers and directors were not accelerated unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification no stockbased compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 25 the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these outofthemoney stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized noncash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  because the approximately 188 million 134 million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification 

 

as of october 28 2006 the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately 1566 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 17 years 

 

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas 123r 

 

research and development rd 

 

 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by 397 million or 8 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase in rd expense was primarily the result of recognizing 330 million of stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas 123r and an increase in employee bonus expense these increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by 17 million or 3 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004 the decrease in rd expenses was caused by a 9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of 21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year these expense reductions were partially offset by a 13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 

rd expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

 

selling marketing general and administrative smga 

 

 

 

smga expenses for fiscal 2006 increased 558 million or 16 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2005 the increase in smga expenses was primarily the result of recording 332 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas 123r and higher employee salary employee benefit and employee bonus expenses these increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

smga expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by 2 million or 1 from the levels recorded in 2004 the decrease in smga expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of 4 million and reductions in other smga expenses of 10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year these expense reductions were partially offset by a 12 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 

 

purchased inprocess research and development 

 

 

 

we incurred charges totaling 217 million for the writeoff of inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 there were no charges for the writeoff of inprocess research and development in fiscal 2005 or 2004 see “— acquisitions” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 

 

special charges — fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 

 

closure of wafer fabrication facility 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 203 million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility located in wilmington massachusetts the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas 88 employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees the severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service and employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit as of october 28 2006 72 of these employees remained employed at our company the employment of 42 of these employees was terminated on november 9 2006 the remaining 30 employees will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup and closure of this wafer fabrication facility 

in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006 which consisted of 183 million of noncash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and 20 million for stayon bonuses we reversed approximately 20 million of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006 the accrual reversal was required because some employees voluntarily left the company other employees found alternative employment within the company and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments normally paid as income continuance were paid as lump sum payments which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments 

 

we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november 9 2006 we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action in the first half of fiscal 2007 of approximately 12 million for lease termination cleanup and closure costs in accordance with sfas 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities the lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred the closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately 50 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007 these annual savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 49 million in cost of sales of which approximately 7 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 1 million in smga expenses 

 

reorganization of product development and support programs 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 112 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and dsp product programs the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees these employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit as of october 28 2006 23 of these employees were still employed by the company 

 

during fiscal 2006 we recorded an additional special charge of 38 million related to this reorganization action approximately 15 million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the writeoff of property plant and equipment and other items the remaining 23 million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to sfas 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees these employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit as of october 28 2006 35 of these employees were still employed by the company 

 

we do not expect to incur any further material charges related to this reorganization action these organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately 25 million per year once fully completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 14 million in rd expenses approximately 8 million in smga expenses and approximately 3 million in cost of sales a portion of these savings associated with the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 have already been realized during the second half of fiscal 2006 

 

operating income 

 

 

 

the 358 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of an 8 increase in net sales and a 60 basis point increase in gross margin percentage these increases were partially offset by 739 million of stockbased operating expenses associated with the adoption of sfas 123r and the 217 million writeoff of purchased inprocess research and development from our recent acquisitions the special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by 297 million from the special charges recorded in fiscal 2005 

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9 decrease in net sales a 110 basis point decrease in gross margin combined with a 315 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by a decrease in operating expense 

 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 

 

nonoperating income increased by 389 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily the result of higher interest income which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 nonoperating income for fiscal 2006 also included a 130 million gain on the sale of our dspbased dsl asic and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

the yeartoyear increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest rates as well as higher average invested cash balances 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned the tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of 352 million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service irs examination during fiscal 2006 including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit in addition the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the writeoff of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below 

 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 or the ajca was signed into law the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations during fiscal 2005 we repatriated 1055 million of accumulated foreign earnings under current tax law the earnings repatriated prior to october 29 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate as a result of this action we recorded additional income tax expense of 49 million in fiscal 2005 

 

we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices inc deferred compensation plan or the deferred compensation plan while they were still subject to the 162m limitation and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal generally upon their retirement due to changes in tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the ajca the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed as a result in fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were subject to the 162m limitation withdrew or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of 72 million as a result of the writeoff of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan 

net income 

 

 

 

net income increased by 1347 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily as the result of the 8 increase in net sales the improvement in gross margin percentage the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense this increase in net income was partially offset by a yeartoyear increase in operating expenses of 875 million primarily as a result of 662 million of stockbased operating expenses related to the adoption of sfas 123r and 231 million of operating expenses related to the our acquisitions during fiscal 2006 these operating expense increases were partially offset by a 297 million decrease in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

 

net income decreased by 156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 this decrease was primarily the result of the yeartoyear decrease in net sales a 49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and 31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005 the decrease in net income was partially offset by a 36 million increase in interest income 

 

the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

acquisitions 

 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed a transaction with ttpcom limited ttpcom whereby ttpcom transferred to us intellectual property engineering resources and related assets associated with the support and customization of ttpcom’s gsmgprsedge modem software for use on our existing and future generations of softfoner baseband processors we also acquired development rights for ajar ttpcom’s advanced applications platform as a result of this transaction we are the single point of contact for both hardware and software support for our new and existing wireless handset customers thus improving our abilities to service the needs of individual customers we paid 119 million in initial cash payments and may become obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of 12 million based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from may 2006 through november 2006 the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition the estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by 78 million resulting in negative goodwill pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 business combinations we recorded a liability for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase price up to the amount of the negative goodwill as contingent payments become due the payments will be applied against the contingent liability contingent payments in excess of 78 million if any will be recorded as additional purchase price as of october 28 2006 we had paid 6 million of contingent payments and the remaining contingent liability was 18 million the purchase price included 55 million of inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 the inprocess technology related to software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both the 2g and 25g cellular wireless technology standards the fair value of the inprocess technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method which is a discounted net cash flow approach at the time of the acquisition the inprocess technology was approximately 56 complete as of october 28 2006 the inprocess research and development projects are on schedule we expect to complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an additional 13 million of expense related to these projects the acquisition also included 132 million of intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use

related party transaction 

 

one of our directors who has served on our board of directors since 1988 became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of tsmc management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from tsmc are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the board of directors of tsmc we purchased approximately 281 million 224 million and 337 million of products from tsmc in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

approximately 17 million and 27 million were payable to tsmc as of october 28 2006 and october 29 2005 respectively we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year 2007 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

at october 28 2006 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 2128 million a decrease of 5776 million from fiscal 2005 our statement of cash flows reflects the impact of 1812 million for allocating the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over a period of several years between the financing and operating section of the statement of cash flows as required by sfas 123r the primary sources of funds for fiscal 2006 were net cash generated from operating activities of 6211 million which is net of the 1812 million of noncash excess tax benefit discussed above 3056 million of cash inflows from the net change in our shortterm availableforsale investments proceeds from the sale of a product line of 231 million and proceeds of 944 million from our various employee stock plans the principal uses of funds during fiscal 2006 were the repurchase of approximately 307 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 1025 million cash dividend payments of 2015 million payments of 1570 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of 1293 million 

 

during fiscal 2005 net cash provided by operations decreased by 105 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decline in net income of 156 million cash and cash equivalents increased by 109 million during fiscal 2005 this increase was the result of 673 million of cash flow from operations 89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and 70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our shortterm availableforsale investments these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of 525 million of our common stock the payment of 119 million of cash dividends and additions to property plant and equipment of 85 million cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 21 million during fiscal 2005 to 2706 million at october 29 2005 

 

 

 

accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by 89 million or 3 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005 this increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

 

inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by 530 million or 16 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by 13 days from the amount at the end of fiscal 2005 approximately 190 million of this increase relates to the inventory that was built in preparation for the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility in california and approximately 37 million relates to the capitalization of manufacturing related stockbased compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the remainder of the increase primarily relates to increased inventory to support anticipated higher sales demand 

 

current liabilities decreased to 4909 million at october 28 2006 a decrease of 3280 million or 40 from 8189 million at the end of fiscal 2005 the decrease in current liabilities was largely the result of a 2333 million net decrease in the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liability primarily as a result of withdrawals by plan participants in response to certain provisions of the american jobs creation act as more fully described below additionally income taxes payable at october 28 2006 decreased by a net of 1113 million compared to the end of fiscal 2005 which was primarily as a result of recording tax deductions in 2006 for stock options exercised 

over a period of several years becoming available upon the completion of the irs examination these decreases were partially offset by a 277 million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the increase in inventory held by our distributors as a result of increases in demand for our products during fiscal 2006 

 

during fiscal 2006 we distributed 2541 million from our amended and restated deferred compensation plan or the deferred compensation plan as a result of participant terminations or at the direction of the participants this amount represented compensation andor stock option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant to the terms of our deferred compensation plan and earnings on those deferred amounts as a result of certain provisions of the american jobs creation act participants had the opportunity until december 31 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts previously deferred 

 

net additions to property plant and equipment were 1293 million in fiscal 2006 855 million in fiscal 2005 and 1462 million in fiscal 2004 fiscal 2007 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 175 million 

 

during fiscal 2006 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 056 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of 2015 million in fiscal 2006 the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity after the end of the fiscal year on november 13 2006 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 016 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 13 2006 to shareholders of record on november 24 2006 and is expected to total approximately 54 million 

 

on may 11 2005 our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august 11 2004 from 500 million to 1 billion on march 14 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional 1 billion of our common stock increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from 1 billion to 2 billion of our common stock under the repurchase program we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program during fiscal 2006 we repurchased approximately 1025 million of our common stock under this plan during fiscal 2005 we repurchased approximately 5255 million of our common stock under this program as of october 28 2006 we had 3124 million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program 

 

the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of october 28 2006

purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected shortterm requirements 

 

the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 

 

at october 28 2006 our principal source of liquidity was 2128 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

 

offbalance sheet financing 

 

as of october 28 2006 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements

new accounting pronouncements 

 

accounting for prior year misstatements 

 

in september 2006 the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment sab 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company’s balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november 15 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings additionally the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected 

through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sab 108 may have on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur it also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers’ fiscal year sfas 158 is effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007 except for the change in measurement date which is effective for us in fiscal 2008 the effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at our fiscal 2007 measurement date september 30 2007 and actual returns on our pension plan assets during the year we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 158 may have on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that fin 48 may have on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

accounting changes and error corrections 

 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 154 which supersedes apb opinion no 20 accounting changes and sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections it establishes unless impracticable retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change however the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively therefore the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 154 during fiscal 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

asset retirements 

 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 fin 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in fasb statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective no 

later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 the adoption of fin 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

inventory costs 

 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151 sfas 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as currentperiod charges in addition sfas 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 151 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

 

longlived assets 

 

we review property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 

periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

 

goodwill 

 

in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows because we have one reporting segment under sfas 142 we utilize the entitywide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly at october 28 2006 we had gross deferred tax assets of 1884 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a 426 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

 

in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 requires that stockbased compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements determining the amount of stockbased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of stock options we calculate the grantdate fair values using the blackscholes valuation model the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions 

 

expected volatility  — we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors including thirdparty estimates when estimating volatility for options granted prior to fiscal 2005 we used historical volatility to estimate the grantdate fair value of stock options we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which 

included consultations with several thirdparty advisors we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grantdate fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market’s expectations of future volatility historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time that our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior options in our stock are actively traded on several exchanges implied volatility is calculated for the period that is commensurate with the option’s expected term assumption because this term often exceeds the period for which there are exchangetraded options in our stock statistical techniques are used to derive the implied volatility for traded options with terms commensurate with the option’s expected term of five years this calculation of implied volatility is derived from the closing prices of the company’s stock and exchange traded options from the most recent five trading days prior to the grant date of the employee stock option in general the higher the expected volatility used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

expected term  — we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the blackscholes grant date valuation we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option and that generally all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior in general the longer the expected term used in the blackscholes valuation model the higher the grantdate fair value of the option 

 

riskfree interest rate  — the yield on zerocoupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the riskfree interest rate 

 

expected dividend yield  — expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter’s cash dividend the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption cash dividends are not paid on options restricted stock or restricted stock units 

 

the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option we currently expect based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures that approximately 84 of our options will vest and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of 34 to all unvested options as of october 28 2006 the 34 represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period therefore the cumulative amount on a compounded basis that is expected to be forfeited is approximately 16 of the aggregate options granted this analysis will be reevaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary ultimately the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 

 

contingencies 

 

from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our commitments and contingencies

interest rate exposure 

 

our annual interest income would change by approximately 16 million in fiscal 2006 and 16 million in fiscal 2005 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates the fair values of our investment portfolio at october 28 2006 and october 29 2005 would change by approximately 6 million and 14 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates 

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

as more fully described in note 2 i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months the shortterm nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at october 28 2006 and october 29 2005 currently our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 28 2006 and october 29 2005 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

  all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “realworld signal processing” within the signal chain 

  significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions the widespread application of lowcost highperformance microprocessorbased systems and of digital communication technologies has increased the need for precise highspeed signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital world at the same time the convergence of computing and communications has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption 

principal products 

  we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our signal processing ics are both generalpurpose standard products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications in some communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in analog and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly 

  we produce and market several thousand products our ten highest revenue products accounted for approximately 12 of our revenue for fiscal 2005 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions 

   our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for four decades and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these products have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components for improved reliability the majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers the data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 62 of our fiscal 2005 revenue other analog ic products include analog signal processing devices such as analog multipliers switches multiplexers and comparators over the past several years we have been expanding our analog ic product 

2 offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics and power management products such as voltage regulators and thermal monitoring ics phase locked loops and highspeed clock ics 

  the majority of our analog ic products are proprietary to us in their design and general purpose in their application this allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide variety of electronic equipment and systems our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems 

  our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables extremely small mechanical sensors to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems® our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration and gyroscopes used to sense position the majority of our current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications however revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets 

   dsps are processors that are optimized for highspeed numeric calculations which are essential for realtime processing of digital data resulting in most cases from analog to digital signal conversion our dsp products are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs or algorithms associated with processing digitized realtime realworld data programmable dsps provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively in software we offer both generalpurpose and applicationspecific dsp products generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from thirdparty suppliers our applicationspecific dsp products typically include analog and dsp technology and the dsps are preprogrammed to execute software for applications such as wireless telecommunications or image processing our dsps are designed in families of products that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same software we support these products with easytouse lowcost development tools which reduce our customers’ product development costs and timetomarket 

  increasingly many of our products combine analog and digital signal processing technology into multifunction mixedsignal devices and chipsets the growing technological demands associated with the use of audio and video in computers and consumer products as well as the networking of communications systems has created new opportunities for these mixedsignal products examples of these products include chipsets for communication applications such as global system for mobile cellular phones or gsm cable modems and broadband modems other examples include audio inputoutput devices for computer applications and data acquisition devices for industrial instrumentation

research and development 

  our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes we spent approximately 497 million during fiscal 2005 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing 

4 processes compared to approximately 514 million during fiscal 2004 and approximately 453 million during fiscal 2003 

  our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing conditioning conversion and processing in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development at over 30 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world 

patents and other intellectual property rights 

  as of october 29 2005 we held 1081 united states patents and had 567 patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office with expiration dates ranging from 2005 through 2024 we believe that while our patents may provide some advantage our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret is considered more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices’ products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices’ components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 

  there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests moreover the laws of countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

sales channels 

  we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors and independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the internet 

  approximately 19 of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to customers in japan approximately 11 of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to customers in china and approximately 22 were to customers elsewhere in asia principally taiwan and korea as of october 29 2005 we had direct sales offices in the asia region in china hong kong india japan korea singapore and taiwan 

  approximately 25 of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to customers in north america as of october 29 2005 we had 11 direct sales offices in the united states 

5   approximately 23 of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to customers in europe as of october 29 2005 we had direct sales offices in austria belgium denmark finland france germany israel italy the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom 

  we also had sales representatives andor distributors in over 45 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding revenues and financial information about geographic areas see our consolidated financial statements and note 3 in the related notes contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  approximately 49 of our fiscal 2005 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell the products to the end users known as “sell out” or “sell through” in the industry these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued including limited product return privileges 

  our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength databooks product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide website on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products 

  we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 4 of our fiscal 2005 net sales and our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 29 of our fiscal 2005 net sales 

foreign operations 

  through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2005 approximately 75 of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments 

  we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement and additional costs related to tax tariff and freight rates although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

production and raw materials 

  monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

6   we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and cmos wafer fabrication processes 

  our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts sunnyvale california and limerick ireland we also operate assembly and test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors 

  capital spending in fiscal 2005 was 85 million compared with 146 million in fiscal 2004 we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 126 million in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2006 we plan to close our sunnyvale wafer fabrication facility and transfer production of products currently manufactured there to our facilities in wilmington massachusetts and limerick ireland as well as to thirdparty wafer fabricators we believe when these actions are complete we will have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels with modest additional capital expenditures 

  our products require a wide variety of components and raw materials most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for many of the components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our products however a large portion of our external wafer purchases are from solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 

backlog 

  backlog at the end of fiscal 2005 was approximately 356 million up from approximately 329 million at the end of fiscal 2004 we define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer or distributor requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue 

government contracts 

  we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2005 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government 

competition 

  we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance analog and mixedsignal processing components competitors for our analog and dsp products include broadcom corporation cirrus logic inc infineon technologies linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation phillips semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments inc sales of our micromachined products currently consist of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes and our main competitors in 

7 that market are bosch denso corporation freescale semiconductor inc panasonic st microelectronics systron donner and vti technologies 

  we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products product price customer service and technical support we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers 

  many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerlyindependent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

environment 

  our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system 

  on january 27 2003 the european union passed the “restriction on use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment” or “rohs” directive 200295 ec which becomes applicable july 1 2006 we are in the process of transitioning the manufacturing process of some of our products to eliminate the use of these hazardous substances the transition has been completed for over 5500 of our standard products and we intend to continue the transition to satisfy local regulatory requirements and the needs of our customers if we do not meet the european union deadline on the use of certain hazardous substances or the deadlines of other countries which may enact such legislation it would preclude us from selling products containing these hazardous substances in these affected locations this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally once the deadline for the mandatory restrictions on the use of certain hazardous materials has passed for the european union we may still have in our inventory products which contain these hazardous substances should we be unable to sell these products to locations which do not have such restrictions we would have to write such inventory off as obsolete this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

employees 

  as of october 29 2005 we employed approximately 8800 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend tentative settlement of the sec’s previously announced stock option investigation 

  in our form 10k filing dated november 30 2004 we disclosed that the securities and exchange commission sec had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results on november 15 2005 we announced that a tentative settlement has been reached 

  since receiving notice of this inquiry we have been cooperating with the sec and believe that the matter will be concluded in the near future we and our president and ceo mr jerald g fishman have made an offer of settlement to the staff of the sec which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the sec’s administrative order and other settlement documents the sec staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the commission a final settlement is subject to review and approval by the commission 

  our board of directors and mr fishman believe that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with the sec 

  the contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues the first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results specifically the issue relates to options granted to our employees  including officers  on november 30 1999 and to employees  including officers  and directors on november 10 2000 the sec settlement would conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results 

  the second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to our employees  including officers  in 1998 and 1999 and the grant date for options granted to employees including officers  and directors in 2001 specifically the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the september 4 1998 options should have been september 8 th  which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options the appropriate grant date for the november 30 1999 options should have been november 29 th  which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used and the appropriate grant date for the july 18 2001 options should have been july 26 th  which is five trading days after the original date 

  in connection with the contemplated settlement we would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under section 10b of the securities exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder would pay a civil money penalty of 3 million and would reprice options granted to mr fishman and other directors in certain years options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing mr fishman would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under sections 17a2 and 3 of the securities act would pay a civil money penalty of 1 million and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years with the exception of options granted in 1998 mr fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter we and mr fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the commission’s findings 

  we have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998 1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005 based on the materiality guidelines contained in sab 99 if a stockbased compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees including officers and directors our net income for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by 218 million in total during this period we earned cumulative net income of over 25 billion there would be no impact on revenue cash flow from operations or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates the impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows fiscal 1998 02 million fiscal 1999 14 million fiscal 2000 18 million fiscal 2001 37 million fiscal 2002 81 million fiscal 2003 61 million fiscal 2004 05 million 

10 other legal proceedings 

  on june 14 2005 biax corporation filed its first amended complaint for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against us and intel corporation alleging that we infringed three patents owned by biax relating to parallel processors on november 7 2005 biax filed a second amended complaint alleging that we infringed two additional patents prior to the filing of the first amended complaint we were unaware of biax or this action the first amended complaint seeks injunctive relief unspecified damages with interest as well as biax’s costs expenses and fees on august 3 2005 we filed an answer and counterclaimed against biax in the counterclaim we seek rulings that the patents are not infringed the patents are invalid and the patents are unenforceable the case has not yet entered the discovery phase we intend to vigorously defend against these allegations we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this litigation 

  on november 6 2003 enron corporation commenced a proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on december 1 2003 enron filed an amended complaint to add us as a defendant in such proceeding the amended complaint alleges that transfers made by enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under commercial paper are recoverable as preferential transfers and fraudulent transfers and are subject to avoidance under the united states bankruptcy code it is alleged that payments made in premature satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper totaling approximately 20 million are recoverable from jp morgan securities inc fleet capital markets fleet national bank andor us we sold 20 million of enron commercial paper to fleet and did not enter into any direct transactions with enron we filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding the motion to dismiss was denied by order dated june 30 2005 we intend to vigorously defend against these claims although we believe we have meritorious defenses to the asserted claims we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of this proceeding 

  we are currently under routine audit by the united states internal revenue service the “irs” for fiscal years 2001 2002 and 2003 the audit has not been completed and the irs has not issued a report on its audit 

  from time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of our business various claims charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from or related to contractual matters patents trademarks personal injury environmental matters product liability insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes as to such claims and litigation we can give no assurance that we will prevail 

  we do not believe that any of the matters described above will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position although an adverse outcome of any of these matters is possible and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts tableend results of operations 

    revenue declined 9 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the ate or automatic test equipment and wireless handset markets during the fiscal year gross margins declined by 110 basis points primarily as a result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production we recorded special charges of 31 million in accordance with our restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of which 20 million related to severance costs associated with the closure of our california wafer fabrication facility and 11 million related to severance costs associated with a reorganization of our product development and support programs during fiscal 2005 we repatriated 1055 million of accumulated foreign earnings under current tax law the earnings repatriated prior to october 29 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate as a result of this action we recorded additional income tax expenses of 49 million in fiscal 2005 we generated cash flow from operations of 673 million during fiscal 2005 repurchased 525 million of our common stock and paid 119 million in cash dividends our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance increased by 21 million during fiscal 2005 to 2706 million at october 29 2005 

  on october 18 2005 we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options granted after december 31 2000 awarded to employees under our stock option plans that had exercise prices of 4000 or greater the vesting terms of options issued to corporate officers and directors were not accelerated unvested options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of their modification no compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees 

  the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized noncash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these options as measured under sfas 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  or sfas 123r the approximately 188 million 134 million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification we are required to adopt sfas 123r effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and we will be required to record compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income rather than in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements 

   net sales declined 245 million or 9 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 this decline was primarily the result of a 21 decrease in orders for products used in communications applications due to weakness in the wireless handset end markets sales to customers in the industrial market decreased 4 as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal 2005 sales to customers in the computer end market decreased 10 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 these decreases were partially offset by a 12 increase in sales to customers in the consumer end market 

16   for fiscal 2004 net sales increased 587 million or 29 from fiscal 2003 this increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believed was a broadbased increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 80 of this yeartoyear increase and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market 

  over the last three fiscal years net sales from analog products were approximately 80 of net sales and sales of dsp products represented approximately 20 of net sales in fiscal 2005 analog product sales decreased 7 and dsp product sales decreased 18 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2004 analog product sales increased 31 and dsp product sales increased 21 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 

  the percentage of sales by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows 

   the percentage of our net sales in china as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets 

    gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2004 the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production 

  gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 by 410 basis points from the gross margin in fiscal 2003 the improvement in gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and to a lesser extent the impact of restructuring actions taken in previous years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations 

    rd expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by 17 million or 3 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004 this decrease was caused by a 9 million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of 21 million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year 

17 these expense reductions were partially offset by a 13 million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 

  rd expenses increased by 62 million or 14 in fiscal 2004 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2003 this increase was primarily due to additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5 increase in engineering headcount during the year as well as annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and to a lesser extent an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased rd activity during the year 

  rd expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

    smga expenses decreased in fiscal 2005 by 2 million or 1 from the levels recorded in 2004 the decrease in smga expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of 4 million and reductions in other smga expenses of 10 million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year these expense reductions were partially offset by a 12 million increase in salary and employee benefit costs 

  smga expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by 52 million or 18 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 this increase was primarily the result of increased salary and employee benefit expenses increased employee bonus expenses increased commission payments as a result of the 29 yeartoyear increase in net sales and to a lesser extent increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities 

   closure of wafer fabrication facility  — during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 20 million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer production to facilities located in massachusetts and ireland as well as to thirdparty wafer fabricators the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative employees as of october 29 2005 the employment of none of these employees had been terminated in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006 these additional charges will consist of approximately 22 million of noncash cost of sales expense for additional depreciation due to the shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment approximately 24 million for stayon bonuses and approximately 6 million for estimated lease termination and cleanup costs the closure of these facilities is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006 and is estimated to result in cost savings of approximately 44 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007 these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 43 million in cost of sales of which approximately 7 million relates to noncash depreciation savings and approximately 1 million in selling marketing general and administrative expense 

  reorganization of product development and support programs  — during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded a special charge of 11 million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product 

18 development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and dsp product programs the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling marketing general and administrative employees as of october 29 2005 the employment of 49 of these employees had been terminated in addition to this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we expect to incur approximately 2 million of additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006 the additional expenses relate to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination costs most of this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006 these organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately 19 million per year once fully completed by the end of fiscal 2006 these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately 9 million in research and development expense approximately 6 million in selling marketing general and administrative expense and approximately 4 million in cost of sales 

   fiscal 2003 — fourth quarter special charge  — during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a special charge of 92 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in belfast northern ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications the charge included 20 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the charge also included 6 million related to the writedown of property plant and equipment to its fair value and 12 million related to the writedown of various other assets to their fair values the closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 

  fiscal 2003 — third quarter special charge  — during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a special charge of 03 million the charge included a 20 million writedown of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages which had been done internally at our facility in the philippines this amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets we also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the writedown of 27 million of equipment to its fair value during the quarter ended august 2 2003 we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain previous restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded and accordingly we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by 44 million 

    the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9 yeartoyear decrease in net sales a 110 basis point yeartoyear decrease in gross margin combined with a 31 million special charge in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by operating expense decreases 

  the increase in operating income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of the 410 basis point yeartoyear improvement in gross margin offset by operating expense increases that were limited to 14 which was less than half the 29 increase in net sales for the year 

    the yeartoyear increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to higher interest rates as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board as well as higher average invested cash balances the yeartoyear decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003 this was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term highcredit quality bonds which offer higher yields than shorterterm investments and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 

  fiscal 2003 included interest expense for our 1200 million 475 convertible subordinated notes that we redeemed on october 1 2003 

    on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 or the ajca was signed into law the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations during fiscal 2005 we repatriated 1055 million of accumulated foreign earnings under current tax law the earnings repatriated prior to october 29 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate as a result of this action we recorded additional income tax expense of 49 million in fiscal 2005 

  we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the 162m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices inc deferred compensation plan or the deferred compensation plan while they were still subject to the 162m limitation and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal generally upon their retirement due to recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the ajca the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed as a result three executive officers who are currently subject to the 162m limitation have either withdrawn or have indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of 72 million as a result of the writeoff of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan 

    net income decreased by 156 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 this decrease was primarily the result of the yeartoyear decrease in net sales a 49 million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and 31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005 these decreases were partially offset by a 36 million increase in interest income 

20   net income increased by 272 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 the improvement in net income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the yeartoyear increase in net sales and to a lesser extent the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 183 recorded in fiscal 2003 to 266 recorded in fiscal 2004 

  the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

   one of our directors who has been a director since 1988 became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in fiscal 2002 we purchased approximately 224 million 337 million and 232 million of products from tsmc in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be obtained from unaffiliated parties approximately 27 million and 15 million were payable to tsmc as of october 29 2005 and october 30 2004 respectively we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

   during fiscal 2005 net cash provided by operations decreased by 105 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to a decline in net income of 156 million cash and cash equivalents increased by 109 million during fiscal 2005 this increase was the result of 673 million of cash flow from operations 89 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and 70 million of cash inflows from the net change in our shortterm availableforsale investments these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of 525 million of our common stock the payment of 119 million of cash dividends and additions to property plant and equipment of 85 million cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 21 million during fiscal 2005 to 2706 million at october 29 2005 

  during fiscal 2004 net cash provided by operations increased by 345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the yeartoyear increase in net income of 272 million during fiscal 2004 we received 124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of 137 million of our common stock additions to property plant and equipment of 146 million and our payment of cash dividends of 75 million in fiscal 2004 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 568 million during fiscal 2004 to 2685 million at october 30 2004 

   accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2005 decreased by 10 million or 29 from the amount at the end of fiscal 2004 this decrease was the result of a lower amount of shipments in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

  inventories decreased by 23 million or 65 and days cost of sales in inventory declined by 9 days during fiscal 2005 this decrease was the result of our aggressive management of spending related to back end 

21 manufacturing and fabricated wafer purchases from external foundries and a modest adjustment of our internal capacity 

  recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the ajca had the effect that distributions from the deferred compensation plan after january 1 2006 could be subject to more stringent tax laws as a result some participants have elected to withdraw or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion or all of their balance from the deferred compensation plan prior to december 31 2005 accordingly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 234 million of our noncurrent deferred compensation plan investments and the offsetting liability became current 

  net additions to property plant and equipment were 85 million in fiscal 2005 146 million in fiscal 2004 and 68 million in fiscal 2003 fiscal 2006 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 126 million 

  during fiscal 2005 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 032 per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of 119 million in fiscal 2005 the payment of future dividends if any will be based on several factors including our financial performance outlook and liquidity after the end of the fiscal year on november 14 2005 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 012 per outstanding share of our common stock the dividend is payable on december 14 2005 to shareholders of record on november 25 2005 and is expected to be approximately 44 million 

  on may 11 2005 our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august 11 2004 from 500 million to 1 billion we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases during fiscal 2004 we repurchased approximately 137 million of our common stock under this plan during fiscal 2005 we repurchased approximately 525 million of our common stock under this plan our previous repurchase program announced on august 15 2002 was terminated by resolution of our board of directors on august 11 2004 

  the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of october 29 2005 

  

 22    purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 

  the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 

  at october 29 2005 our principal source of liquidity was 2706 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

   as of october 29 2005 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

tentative settlement of the sec’s previously announced stock option investigation 

  in our form 10k filing dated november 30 2004 we disclosed that the securities and exchange commission sec had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results on november 15 2005 we announced that a tentative settlement has been reached 

  since receiving notice of this inquiry we have been cooperating with the sec and believe that the matter will be concluded in the near future we and our president and ceo mr jerald g fishman have made an offer of settlement to the staff of the sec which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the sec’s administrative order and other settlement documents the sec staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the commission a final settlement is subject to review and approval by the commission 

  our board of directors and mr fishman believe that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with the sec 

  the contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues the first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results specifically the issue relates to options granted to our employees including officers on november 30 1999 and to employees including officers and directors on november 10 2000 the sec settlement would conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results 

  the second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to our employees including officers in 1998 and 1999 and the grant date for options granted to employees including officers and directors in 2001 specifically the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the september 4 1998 options should have been september 8 th  which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options the appropriate grant date for the november 30 1999 

23 options should have been november 29 th  which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used and the appropriate grant date for the july 18 2001 options should have been july 26 th  which is five trading days after the original date 

  in connection with the contemplated settlement we would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under section 10b of the securities exchange act and rule 10b5 thereunder would pay a civil money penalty of 3 million and would reprice options granted to mr fishman and other directors in certain years options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing mr fishman would consent to a ceaseanddesist order under sections 17a2 and 3 of the securities act would pay a civil money penalty of 1 million and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years with the exception of options granted in 1998 mr fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter we and mr fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the commission’s findings 

  we have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998 1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005 based on the materiality guidelines contained in sab 99 if a stockbased compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees including officers and directors our net income for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by 218 million in total during this period we earned cumulative net income of over 25 billion there would be no impact on revenue cash flow from operations or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates the impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows fiscal 1998 02 million fiscal 1999 14 million fiscal 2000 18 million fiscal 2001 37 million fiscal 2002 81 million fiscal 2003 61 million fiscal 2004 05 million 

outlook 

  we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to be similar to the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 with the adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we estimate that stockbased compensation expense will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately 004 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 including this stockbased compensation expense we expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately 031 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

new accounting pronouncements 

   in may 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 154 which supersedes apb opinion no 20 accounting changes and sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  sfas 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections it establishes unless impracticable retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change however the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively therefore the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

   in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 fin 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143  fin 47 clarifies that the term 

24 “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in fasb statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we are currently analyzing fin 47 and believe the adoption of fin 47 will not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

   in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets — an amendment of apb opinion no 29  sfas 153 sfas 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 153 in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 did not impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

   in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151 sfas 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as currentperiod charges in addition sfas 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas 151 and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

   on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123r sfas 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 95 statement of cash flows  sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods the “modified prospective” method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date the “modified retrospective” method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

  as permitted by sfas 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb opinion no 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas 123r will have a significant impact on our results of 

25 operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position sfas 123r is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted sfas 123r in fiscal year 2006 on october 30 2005 using the modified prospective method we estimate that expense related to sharebased payments to employees will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately 004 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 

   we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

   we review property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in addition in certain instances assets may not be impaired but their 

26 estimated useful lives may have decreased in these situations we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 

   in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  as required by sfas 142 goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows because we have one reporting segment under sfas 142 we utilize the entitywide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

   we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities sfas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly at october 29 2005 we had gross deferred tax assets of 142 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a 42 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

  in addition we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

   from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 or sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

forwardlooking statements 

  this annual report on form 10k contains or incorporates forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions in addition other written or oral statements that constitute forwardlooking statements may be made by or on our behalf words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “seek” “estimate” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “factors that may affect future results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements we make we do not intend to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

factors that may affect future results 

our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 

  our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors competitive pricing pressures fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity the risk that our backlog could decline significantly our ability to hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers changes in product mix and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 

longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

  in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp falloff of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets 

  our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products if developed will achieve market acceptance in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet 

28 the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk 

we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future 

  many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assemblytest services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 

  we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs additionally we utilize thirdparty wafer fabricators as solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications we have no written supply agreements with these solesource suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 

we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 

  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly during these periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to these periods of increased demand these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 

our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 

  we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 

  we rely primarily upon knowhow rather than on patents to develop and maintain our competitive position there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse 

29 engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 

we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 

  there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience innovation and management skill there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests 

  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services 

  we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty waferfabrication foundries as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of electric power or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

30 we are exposed to economic political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 

  during fiscal year 2005 approximately 75 of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases particularly in the united states and china as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement and additional costs related to tax tariff and freight rate increases 

our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives 

  a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives our operating results could be adversely affected 

our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 

  we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

   our annual interest income would change by approximately 16 million in fiscal 2005 and 19 million in fiscal 2004 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates the fair values of our investment portfolio at october 29 2005 and october 30 2004 would change by approximately 14 million and 24 million respectively for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates 

   as more fully described in note 2 i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months the shortterm nature of these 

31 contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at october 29 2005 and october 30 2004 currently our largest foreign currency exposure is against the euro primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 2005 and october 30 2004 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

 item 1 business tableend company overview   we are a world leader in the design manufacture and marketing of highperformance analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing for industrial communication computer and consumer applications since our inception in 1965 we have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in electronic equipment signal processing is where the analog and digital worlds meet to provide the advantages of digital technologies to the real world our products play a fundamental role in converting realworld phenomena such as temperature motion pressure light and sound into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic equipment ranging from industrial process control factory automation systems equipment defense electronics base stations central office equipment wireless telephones computers automobiles cat scanners digital cameras and dvd players signal processing is the cornerstone of highspeed communications digital entertainment and other consumer computer and industrial applications as new generations of digital applications evolve they generate new needs for highperformance analog and digital signal processing or dsp technology we produce a wide range of products that are designed to meet the technology needs of a broad base of customers   during fiscal 2004 approximately 36 of our revenue came from the industrial market which includes factory automation medical equipment scientific instrumentation automatic test equipment automotive electronics security equipment and aerospace and defense systems   revenues from the communications market represented approximately 37 of our fiscal 2004 revenue communications applications include wireless handsets and base stations as well as products used for highspeed access to the internet including broadband modems and central office networking equipment   we also serve the personal computer market with products that monitor and manage power usage process signals used in flat panel displays and multimedia projectors and enable cdquality audio in fiscal 2004 the computer market accounted for approximately 14 of our revenue   the demand for our products used in highperformance consumer electronics has been increasing and represented approximately 13 of our revenue for fiscal 2004 applications in this market include digital cameras and camcorders dvd players advanced digital televisions and surround sound audio systems   we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors and independent sales representatives we have direct sales offices in 19 countries including the united states   we are headquartered near boston in norwood massachusetts and have manufacturing facilities in massachusetts california north carolina ireland and the philippines we were founded in 1965 and are incorporated in massachusetts as of october 30 2004 we employed approximately 8900 individuals worldwide our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol adi and is included in the standard  poor’s 500 index   we maintain a website with the address wwwanalogcom we are not including the information contained on our website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission we also make available on our website our corporate governance guidelines the charters for our audit committee compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee and our code of business conduct and ethics and such information is available in print to any stockholder of analog who requests it in addition we intend to disclose on our website any amendments to or waivers from our code of business conduct and ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange 1 industry background   all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and motion this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “realworld signal processing” within the signal chain   significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits or ics used in signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions the widespread application of lowcost microprocessorbased systems and of digital communication technologies has increased the need for signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital world at the same time the convergence of computing and communications has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption principal products   we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our signal processing ics are both general purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as applicationspecific products designed for specific clusters of customers in vertical markets by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications in some communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in analog and dsp and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly   we produce and market several thousand products our ten highest revenue products accounted for approximately 17 of our revenue for fiscal 2004 the majority of our products are proprietary meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions 

 

   our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for nearly four decades and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance devices generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed the principal advantages these applications have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower power consumption and fewer components for improved reliability the majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers the data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 60 of our fiscal 2004 revenue other analog ic products include analog signal processing devices such as analog multipliers switches multiplexers and comparators over the past several years we have been expanding our 2 analog ic product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics and power management products such as voltage regulators and thermal monitoring ics 

  the majority of our analog ic products are proprietary to us in their design and general purpose in their application this allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide variety of electronic equipment and systems our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems   our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables extremely small mechanical sensors to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element the integration of signal conditioning and mems is a unique feature of our products which we call imems® our imems product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration and gyroscopes used to sense position the majority of our current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications however revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets

  instrumentation  — our instrumentation market includes engineering medical and scientific instruments these products are usually designed using the highest performance analog and mixedsignal ics available customer products include oscilloscopes logic analyzers cat scanners mri equipment blood analyzers and microscopes   defenseaerospace  — the defense commercial avionics and space markets all require highperformance ics that meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications many of our analog ics can be supplied in versions that meet these standards in addition many products can be supplied to meet the standards required for broadcast satellites and other commercial space applications most of our products sold in this market are specificallytested versions of products derived from our standard product offering customer products include navigation systems flight simulators radar systems and security devices   automotive  — although the automotive market has historically been served with lowcost lowperformance ics demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide range of safety and entertainment applications in response we are developing products specifically for the automotive market we supply a micromachined ic used as a crash sensor in airbag systems we believe that other micromachined devices derived from this product may be suitable for other automotive applications such as rollover sensing global positioning satellite or gps automotive navigation systems antilock brakes and “smart” suspension systems in addition our analog and dsp ics have application in engine control incabin electronics and collision avoidance systems   communications  — the development of broadband wireless and internet infrastructures around the world has created an important market for our communications products communications technology involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data the need for higher speed and reduced power consumption coupled with more reliable bandwidthefficient communications has been creating demand for our products our products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for audio data image and video communication in wireless and broadband communication applications our products are incorporated into cellular telephones cellular base station equipment modems pagers pbx switches routers and remote access servers   computers and computer peripherals  — increased interface between users and pcs through monitors printers scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and thermal management capability in pcs have provided opportunities in the computer market the computer industry seeks to develop and market ever smaller and lighter personal computers this need increases demand for highperformance ics that monitor power usage enabling manufacturers to use smaller batteries and extend battery life between charges in addition we currently supply a variety of ics used in this market for functions such as graphic displays interfaces between pcs and peripherals such as lcd monitors and projectors and enhanced audio input and output capability for business and entertainment applications   consumer electronics  — increased market demand for digital entertainment systems for acquisition display and digital processing of signals has allowed us to combine analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that are designed to meet the rigorous cost size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market the emergence of highperformance featurerich consumer products such as digital camcorders and cameras home theater systems advanced digital televisions video projectors and dvd recordersplayers has led to the need for highperformance systemlevel ics with a high level of specific functionality research and development   our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and processes and the improvement of 4 existing products and processes we spent approximately 512 million during fiscal 2004 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and processes compared to approximately 450 million during fiscal 2003 and approximately 424 million during fiscal 2002 

  our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal conditioning conversion and processing in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and process development at over 28 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world patents and other intellectual property rights   as of october 30 2004 we held 935 united states patents and had 569 patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office with expiration dates ranging from 2004 through 2023 we believe that while our patents may provide some advantage our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge ability and experience of our personnel the range and number of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret is considered more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine analog devices’ products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine analog devices’ components in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984   there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests moreover the laws of countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology   the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved sales channels   we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the internet   the fastest growing part of our business has been to customers in markets other than north america and europe approximately 19 of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in japan approximately 14 of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in china and approximately 22 were to customers elsewhere in asia principally taiwan and korea as of october 30 2004 we had direct sales offices in the asia region in china hong kong india japan korea singapore and taiwan 5   approximately 25 of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in north america as of october 30 2004 we had 10 direct sales offices in the united states   approximately 20 of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in europe as of october 30 2004 we had direct sales offices in austria belgium denmark france germany israel italy the netherlands sweden and the united kingdom   we also had sales representatives andor distributors in over 45 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding financial information about geographic areas see note 3 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k   approximately 50 of our fiscal 2004 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell the products to the end users these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued including limited product return privileges   our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength databooks product catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide website on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products   we have tens of thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer excluding distributors represented approximately 3 of our fiscal 2004 net sales and our 20 largest customers excluding distributors accounted for approximately 29 of our fiscal 2004 net sales foreign operations   through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states during fiscal 2004 approximately 75 of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments   we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement and additional costs related to tax tariff and freight rates although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies production and raw materials   monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to 6 manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals ceramic and plastic used for packaging 

  we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and mems ics we also use bipolar and cmos wafer fabrication processes   our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts sunnyvale california and limerick ireland we also operate assembly and test facilities located in the philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors   capital spending in fiscal 2004 was 146 million compared with 68 million in fiscal 2003 we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 150 million in fiscal 2005 we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels with modest additional capital expenditures   our products require a wide variety of components and raw materials most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for the majority of the components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our products however in some cases we purchase components from solesource suppliers such as external foundries if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed backlog   backlog at the end of fiscal 2004 was approximately 329 million down from approximately 387 million at the end of fiscal 2003 this decrease was due to the reduced order levels and increased order cancellations as a result of what we believe was an inventory correction during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 we define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue government contracts   we estimate that approximately 3 of our fiscal 2004 revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government competition   we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance analog and mixedsignal processing components competitors for our analog and dsp products include cirrus logic inc linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation phillips semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments inc sales of our micromachined products are currently 7 comprised of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes and our main competitors in that market are bosch freescale semiconductor inc denso corporation and st microelectronics 

  we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products product price customer service and technical support we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers   many other companies offer products that compete with our products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerlyindependent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition environment   our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position   we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system employees   as of october 30 2004 we employed approximately 8900 individuals worldwide our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes we believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 8

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as noted tableend results of operations   overview    fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were successful years for analog devices during these two fiscal years we experienced a continuation of what we believe is a broadbased cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that began for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we began fiscal year 2004 with a plan to increase net sales by approximately 25 and for gross margins to continue to improve during the year net sales increased by 29 to 2634 million in fiscal 2004 up from the 2047 million recorded in the prior year our gross margins improved by 410 basis points to 59 in fiscal 2004 up from 549 recorded in fiscal 2003 for fiscal 2004 we had anticipated that operating expenses would grow at a rate significantly less than that of our revenue growth rate operating expenses for the fiscal year increased 14 yeartoyear or slightly less than half the growth rate of net sales for the year diluted earnings per share improved to 145 per share in fiscal 2004 up 86 from the 078 per share recorded in fiscal 2003 net cash provided by operations was 778 million or 295 of net sales in fiscal 2004 

 

   net sales recorded in fiscal 2004 were 2634 million an increase of 29 over net sales of 2047 million recorded in fiscal 2003 the 587 million increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a result of what we believe was a broadbased increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately 77 of this yeartoyear increase and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market   for fiscal 2003 net sales of 2047 million increased by 20 from the 1708 million recorded in fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2003 demand was very strong for our products used in consumer products while demand was relatively flat for our products used in applications that depend on industrial enterprise or carrier capital spending as a result demand for analog and dsp products used in wireless handsets desktop and laptop computers consumer products such as digital cameras and flat panel displays increased in fiscal 2003 above the levels experienced in fiscal 2002   in fiscal 2004 analog product sales increased 31 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 analog product sales increased 16 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2004 dsp product sales increased by 21 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 after increasing 35 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 over the last three fiscal years net sales from analog products were in the range of 78 to 80 of net sales and sales of dsp products represented the remaining 20 to 22 of net sales   sales of new products which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters were 21 of net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to 19 in fiscal 2003 and 21 in fiscal 2002 the yearoveryear dollar increase in sales of new products was 45 in fiscal 2004 and was attributable to increased demand and design wins for some of our products used in communications industrial consumer and computer applications this increase followed a yeartoyear dollar increase in sales of new products of 8 in fiscal 2003 and a yeartoyear 15 decline of sales of new products of 17 in fiscal 2002 as we went through a downturn in the semiconductor industry 

  the percentage of sales by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows    the decrease in north american and european sales and the increase in sales in asia and japan as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to asia and increased demand for our products in japan and in asia particularly in china the increase in sales in dollar terms in japan was 36 and 29 respectively for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and was the result of a general recovery in demand for our products in japan and in particular an increase in demand for our products used in the manufacture of automatic test equipment and consumer products sales in dollars increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 by 73 and 75 respectively in china and by 16 and 27 respectively in the rest of asia as a result of increased demand for products used in communications industrial consumer and computer products in fiscal 2004 sales in dollar terms increased by 20 in europe and 24 in north america because of the broadbased improvement in demand for our products used in industrial communications consumer and computer products sales in dollars in fiscal 2003 increased by 12 as compared to fiscal 2002 in europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our products during the year the slight increase in fiscal 2003 north america sales in dollars as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to increased demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in asia 

 

   gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 to 1554 million or 59 of net sales up 410 basis points from the gross margin of 1124 million or 549 of net sales recorded in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2002 gross margins were 905 million or 53 of net sales the improvement in gross margins for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and to a lesser extent the impact of restructuring actions taken in recent years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations 

 

    rd expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by 62 million or 14 to 512 million from the 450 million recorded in fiscal 2003 rd expenses increased 26 million or 6 to 450 million in fiscal 2003 from the 424 million recorded in fiscal 2002 rd expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 194 in fiscal 2004 from 22 in fiscal 2003 and from 248 in fiscal 2002 as a result of the 29 and 20 yeartoyear increase in revenue for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively rd expenses increased by 14 yeartoyear in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of additional salary and benefit costs associated with a 5 increase in engineering headcount during the year these expenses also increased as a result of annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and to a lesser extent an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased rd activity during the year for fiscal 2003 the yeartoyear increase in rd expenses was 16 limited to 6 as a result of acquisitionrelated expenses declining yeartoyear by 56 million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires the reduction in acquisitionrelated expenses to 82 million in fiscal 2003 from 138 million in fiscal 2002 arose primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included additional expenses related to fixedvalue contingent compensation and the achievement of final performancebased criteria that did not recur in fiscal 2003 

  rd expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from yeartoyear depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts which we view as critical to our future growth at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future 

 

    smga expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by 52 million or 18 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 the increase in smga expenses was 31 million or 12 from the 257 million recorded in fiscal 2002 as a percentage of net sales smga declined over the past two fiscal years primarily due to the increases in net sales for each of those years for fiscal 2004 the increase in smga expenses over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of increased salary and employee benefit costs and bonus payments to employees increased commission payments as a result of the 29 yeartoyear increase in net sales and to a lesser extent increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities the increase in smga expenses in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of increased commission amounts paid due to the 20 yeartoyear increase in net sales the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist existing and potential customers to design products that incorporate adi technology to address their specific requirements as well as initiatives to publicize new products these increases were offset by limitations on discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees 

 

   amortization of intangibles was 3 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared with 57 million for fiscal 2002 the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2003 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 was the result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets effective november 3 2002 which results in goodwill no longer being amortized 

 

   during fiscal 2003 we recorded special charges of 95 million and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling 485 million special charges recorded in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 are more fully described under the heading “special charges” below there were no special charges recorded in fiscal 2004 

 

   our operating income was 699 million or 266 of net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 374 million or 183 of net sales in fiscal 2003 the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2004 over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was a result of the 410 basis point yeartoyear improvement in gross margin combined with operating expense increases that were limited to 14 which was less than half 17 the 29 increase in net sales for the year operating income was 118 million or 69 of net sales in fiscal 2002 

 

   interest expense was 02 million in fiscal 2004 32 million in fiscal 2003 and 44 million in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 included interest expense for only 11 months and fiscal 2002 included interest expense for 12 months as we redeemed our 1200 million 475 convertible subordinated notes or notes on october 1 2003 in addition an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in january 2002 had the effect of swapping the 475 fixed rate of our notes into a liborbased floating rate that was 161 as of november 6 2002 and was 114 at the time we redeemed our notes on october 1 2003 these two items resulted in the yeartoyear decline in interest expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003   interest income was 36 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 41 million in fiscal 2003 and 65 million in fiscal 2002 the yeartoyear decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption in 2003 this was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our holdings of longer term highcredit quality bonds which offer higher yields than shorterterm investments and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board the yeartoyear decrease in interest income in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interestbearing investments 

 

   our effective income tax rate was 22 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 as compared to 25 for fiscal 2002 the decrease in the effective rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of the discontinuance of nondeductible goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of fas 142 goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in the fiscal 2002 tax provision which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate 

 

    fiscal 2004 net income was 571 million or 217 of net sales and diluted earnings per share was 145 compared to net income in fiscal 2003 of 298 million or 146 of net sales and diluted earnings per share of 078 the fiscal 2004 increase in net income of 272 million from the level recorded in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the yeartoyear increase in net sales and to a lesser extent the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from 183 recorded in fiscal 2003 to 266 recorded in fiscal 2004 for fiscal 2002 net income was 105 million or 62 of net sales the improvement in net income in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was the result of an increase in net sales the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges   the impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

 

   one of our directors who has been a director since 1988 became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc in fiscal 2002 we purchased approximately 337 million 232 million and 206 million of products from tsmc in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be 18 obtained from unaffiliated parties approximately 15 million and 14 million was payable to tsmc as of october 30 2004 and november 1 2003 respectively we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year 2005 

liquidity and capital resources    during fiscal 2004 net cash provided by operations increased by 345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the yeartoyear increase in net income of 272 million during fiscal 2004 we received 124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of approximately 137 million of our common stock additions to property plant and equipment of 146 million and our payment of cash dividends of 75 million in fiscal 2004 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 568 million during fiscal 2004 to 2685 million at october 30 2004   during fiscal 2003 net cash from operations increased by 207 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2002 primarily due to a yeartoyear increase in net income of 193 million in fiscal 2003 we received 71 million from our employee stock plans cash inflows in fiscal 2003 were offset by additions to property plant and equipment of 68 million and by a net payment of 1198 million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased by 781 million during fiscal 2003 to 2117 million at november 1 2003 from 2898 million at november 2 2002 primarily as a result of these activities   accounts receivable of 329 million at the end of fiscal 2004 increased by 34 million or 12 from 295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 this increase resulted principally from a 75 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 accounts receivable of 295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased 67 million or 29 from 228 million at the end of fiscal 2002 this increase resulted principally from a 102 million increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 days sales outstanding increased from 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 the yeartoyear increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2003 was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002   inventories increased by 58 million or 20 from the end of fiscal 2003 to 346 million at the end of fiscal 2004 days cost of sales in inventory increased by 17 days to 123 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the increase in inventory in dollars was the result of an increase in internal production and purchases of fabricated wafers from external foundries in response to the increases in demand for our products particularly in the first half of fiscal 2004 combined with the impact of a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the levels recorded in the prior quarter net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 declined 12 from the levels recorded in the prior quarter because incoming order rates from our customers slowed as a result of what we believe is an inventory correction at our customers inventories declined by 19 million or 6 from the end of fiscal 2002 to 288 million at the end of fiscal 2003 days cost of sales in inventory declined by 29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 the decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the fiscal year 2003 progressed   net additions to property plant and equipment were 146 million in fiscal 2004 68 million in fiscal 2003 and 57 million in fiscal 2002 the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year was principally the result of additions to manufacturing capacity at our facilities in response to the increased 19 demand levels for our products we experienced in fiscal 2003 and 2004 fiscal 2005 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 150 million 

  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we redeemed all of our outstanding notes for cash the redemption price was 10190 of the principal amount of the notes or 1223 million a net pretax loss of 02 million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption comprised of a 108 million gain on the redemption of the notes that was offset by a writeoff of 11 million of deferred financing costs the gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the marktomarket of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value as a result apart from operating lease obligations we had no debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004   during fiscal 2004 our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling 020 per outstanding share of common stock which were paid during the fiscal year these dividend payments amounted in total to approximately 75 million the payment of future dividends if any will be based on our quarterly financial performance   on august 11 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 500 million of our common stock we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases during fiscal 2004 we repurchased approximately 137 million of our common stock under this plan our previous repurchase program announced on august 15 2002 was terminated by resolution of our board of directors on august 11 2004   the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of october 30 2004   20    purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements in addition our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements   the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information   at october 30 2004 our principal source of liquidity was 2685 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future outlook   during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 we experienced the continuation of what we believe is a broadbased cyclical improvement in the semiconductor industry that started for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 however during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 incoming order rates from our customers slowed and order cancellations increased we believe this is the result of an inventory correction at our customers the level of incoming order rates remained low through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 declined 12 from the levels recorded in the prior quarter net sales declined in all geographic regions but especially in china and japan where the effects of the inventory correction and the economic constraints imposed by the chinese government impacted demand for our products used in wireless handsets wireless infrastructure semiconductor capital equipment in particular automatic test equipment and to a lesser extent consumer and computer products   we are entering fiscal 2005 with a cautious outlook particularly for the first fiscal quarter of the year much of the order rate decline we have experienced appears to be related to inventory adjustments and we believe we have already absorbed significant inventory reductions at our customers there continues to be much uncertainty about interest rate levels and higher energy prices and their potential impact on consumer spending and as a result our customers continue to be cautious accordingly we are entering fiscal 2005 with low levels of backlog which limits our visibility and makes it very difficult to predict revenue levels for fiscal 2005   against this background we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to be in the range of 575 million to 600 million and we expect gross margins to remain at 58 to 59 and operating expenses to decline sequentially by between 3 and 4 based on these assumptions we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 028 to 031 for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 while our current lack of visibility causes us to be cautious about fiscal 2005 we are planning for demand for our products to recover in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and throughout the fiscal year and for our financial results to reflect this improvement in line with the expected recovery in demand we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 150 million in fiscal 2005 depreciation expense is expected to increase to approximately 160 million in fiscal 2005 from 150 million in fiscal 2004 we anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat yeartoyear at approximately 22 21 special charges 

 

   during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a special charge of 03 million the charge included a 20 million writedown of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages which had been done internally at our facility in the philippines this amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets we also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the writedown of 27 million of equipment to its fair value during the quarter ended august 2 2003 we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded accordingly we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by 44 million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a special charge of 92 million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in belfast northern ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications the charge included 20 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the charge also included 6 million related to the writedown of property plant and equipment to its fair value and 12 million related to the writedown of various other assets to their fair values the closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 

 

   during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of approximately 272 million the second quarter charge was comprised of 257 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our three sixinch and one eightinch wafer fabrication facilities and 3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment which was partially offset by an adjustment of 15 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001 the investment impairment which was related to an equity investment in a private company was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made included in the 257 million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of 153 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the united states and ireland 23 million related to the writedown of equipment to be abandoned and 81 million of other charges primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs the writedown of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we reversed 29 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs the lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and to a lesser extent the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates the 509 employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439 and as of may 1 2004 all of the employees had been terminated the reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to positions in our sixinch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products all the planned closure and consolidation actions related to our fourinch wafer fabrication facilities are now complete since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment   during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of approximately 128 million the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of 37 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and to a lesser extent in manufacturing 38 million related to the impairment of an investment 34 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001 and 19 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees the investment impairment which was related to an equity investment in a private company was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made the severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the united states 22 europe and canada and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the united states all of whom had been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 

  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of approximately 84 million the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of 25 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately 65 employees in the united states and europe all of whom had been terminated as of november 1 2003 the charges also included 21 million related to the impairment of investments 18 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of 20 million for additional estimated cleanup costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be otherthantemporary and to an equity investment in a private company the private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon 

 

   during fiscal 2001 we recorded special charges of approximately 47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and to a lesser extent in selling marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of 296 million for approximately 1200 employees in the united states europe asia and the philippines all of whom had been terminated as of january 31 2004 the special charges also included 116 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and 58 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees the amount paid was 15 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by 15 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to reflect this change in estimate in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be 13 million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that 02 million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required therefore we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate new accounting pronouncements   in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities and amended it by issuing fin 46r in december 2003 fin 46r requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the assets liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity because we do not have any variable interest entities the adoption of fin 46r in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations   in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 revised 2003 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits which enhanced the required disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans but did not change the measurement or recognition principles for those plans the statement requires additional interim and annual disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans the required interim disclosures were effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 and the required annual disclosures are included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k   in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 sab 104 updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic 13 of the codification of staff 23 accounting bulletins in order to make the interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations we are following the guidance of sab 104 

  in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no 031 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments additionally eitf issue no 031 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 031 however the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our fiscal year ended october 30 2004 we will evaluate the effect if any of eitf issue no 031 when final guidance is released critical accounting policies and estimates   management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user however the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 

 

   we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts when appropriate for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate our actual losses may exceed our estimates and additional allowances would be required 

 

   we review property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the 24 preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

   in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we adopted the new rules of fas 142 for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment as required by fas 142 all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows because we have one reporting segment under fas 142 we utilize the entitywide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

   we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or fas 109 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities fas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly at october 30 2004 we had gross deferred tax assets of 144 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a 33 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made   in addition we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

 

   from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 or fas 5 accounting for contingencies in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with 25 fas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

forwardlooking statements   this annual report on form 10k contains or incorporates forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions in addition other written or oral statements that constitute forwardlooking statements may be made by or on our behalf words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “seek” “estimate” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “factors that may affect future results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements we make we do not intend to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate   our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors competitive pricing pressures fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity the risk that our backlog could decline significantly our ability to hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers changes in product mix and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results   in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp falloff of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial reductions cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets   our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new 26 products if developed will achieve market acceptance in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk 

we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future   many other companies offer products that compete with our products some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assemblytest services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply   we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs additionally we utilize thirdparty wafer fabricators as solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications we have no written supply agreements with these solesource suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly during these periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to these periods of increased demand these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity   we and the semiconductor industry generally expand production facilities and access to thirdparty foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 27 we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively   we rely primarily upon knowhow rather than on patents to develop and maintain our competitive position there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties   there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience innovation and management skill there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests   the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited   our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services   we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport in addition california has 28 experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity to date the impact on us has been negligible however electricity is a critical resource for us without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of electric power or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to economic political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations   during fiscal year 2004 approximately 75 of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies potential interest rate increases particularly in the united states and china as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls currency exchange rate movement and additional costs related to tax tariff and freight rate increases our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives   a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives our operating results could be adversely affected our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted   we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

we electronically file such material with or furnish such material to the securities and exchange commission in addition we intend to disclose on our website any amendments to or waivers from our code of business conduct and ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission 1 industry background   all electronic signals fall into one of two categories analog or digital analog also known as linear signals represent realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound speed and acceleration this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuouslyvarying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “realworld signal processing” within the signal chain   significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of ics used in signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible more highlyintegrated solutions the widespread application of lowcost microprocessorbased systems and of digital communication technologies has increased the need for signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital world at the same time the convergence of computing and communications has resulted in end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption principal products   we design manufacture and market a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies our ics are designed to address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications across the entire range of our signal processing ics are both general purpose products as well as custom products designed for specific applications and customers by using readily available highperformance generalpurpose products in their systems our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market given the high cost of developing customized ics our standard products often provide the most costeffective solution for many low to medium volume applications in many emerging markets including communications computer and consumer products we focus on working with leading customers to design applicationspecific solutions we begin with our existing core technologies in analog dsp and mixedsignal and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers because we have already developed the core technology for our generalpurpose products we can create applicationspecific solutions quickly   we produce and market several thousand products our highest revenue product accounted for approximately 2 of our revenue for fiscal 2002 approximately 80 of our products are proprietary and equivalent products are not available only a limited number of other companies may provide products with similar function 

 

   our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for more than 30 years and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance singlefunction devices the majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers the data converters and amplifiers product categories accounted for 55 of our fiscal 2002 revenues other analog ic products include analog signal processing devices such as analog multipliers voltage references and comparators over the past few years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits or rf ics and power and thermal monitoring ics we are also expanding our analog ic product line to better meet the needs of customers designing portable batteryoperated equipment 2   our analog ic products tend to be proprietary to us in their design and general purpose in their application this allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide variety of electronic equipment and systems our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers our analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers or oems and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems most of our analog ics have been purchased by oems to serve the industrial instrumentation defense aerospace and automotive markets but during the past few years they have been increasingly used for applications in communications computers and other consumer applications requiring highperformance realworld signal processing the principal requirements these applications have in common include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower weight and fewer components for improved reliability   our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining which is used to produce semiconductor products known as microelectromechanical systems or mems this technology enables extremely small mechanical structures to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element our mems products are known as accelerometers and are used to monitor acceleration in a wide variety of applications the majority of our current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications recently we have combined our mems technology with silicononinsulator or soi technology we obtained through the acquisition of bco technologies plc in fiscal 2000 soi technology creates multiple layers of silicon as a single substrate our next generation of inertial sensors for the airbag market will incorporate both soi and mems technology soi mems is a process where one layer is used for the mems device and the other layer is used for the circuitry emerging applications include global positioning satellite automobile navigation systems earthquake detectors and highend computer joysticks we have recently introduced a mems gyroscope that could have applications in automobiles industrial robotics and various navigation applications

that are designed to meet the rigorous cost size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market the emergence of highperformance featurerich consumer products such as home theater systems video projectors dvd players and digital camcorders and cameras has led to the need for highperformance systemlevel ics with a high level of specific functionality research and development   our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and processes and for improving existing products and processes we spent approximately 424 million during fiscal 2002 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and processes compared to approximately 465 million during fiscal 2001 and approximately 390 million during fiscal 2000   our rd strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal conditioning conversion and processing in support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and process development at over 30 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world patents and other intellectual property rights   as of november 2 2002 we held 704 united states patents and had 446 patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office with expiration dates ranging from 2002 through 2022 we believe that while our patents may provide some advantage our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge ability and experience of our personnel the range and number of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support it is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret is considered more advantageous we also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets in addition we have registered certain of our mask sets under the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984   there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests moreover the laws of countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology   the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 5 sales channels   we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors and independent sales representatives approximately 30 of our fiscal 2002 net sales were to customers in north america as of december 1 2002 we had 13 sales offices in the united states and our thirdparty distribution channel consisted of six national and regional thirdparty distributors and several independent sales representatives in numerous locations throughout the united states and canada   approximately 21 of our fiscal 2002 net sales were to customers in europe 17 to customers in japan and 32 to customers in other international markets as of december 1 2002 we had direct sales offices in austria canada china denmark france germany hong kong india israel italy japan korea the netherlands singapore sweden taiwan and the united kingdom we also had sales representatives andor distributors in approximately 45 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding financial information about geographic areas see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k   a significant portion of our fiscal 2002 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell the products to the end users these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued including limited product return privileges   our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength databooks shortform catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide website on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products during their product development cycles   we have thousands of customers worldwide our largest single customer represented approximately 3 of net sales for fiscal 2002 and our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2002   see note 4 “industry and geographic segment information” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k foreign operations   through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the united states our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments   during fiscal 2002 approximately 70 of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland the united kingdom the philippines and taiwan in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates tax and tariff rates and freight rates and social and political unrest although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate 6 fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 

production and raw materials   monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals ceramic packages and plastic used for packaging   we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and micromachined ics we also use industrystandard bipolar and cmos wafer fabrication processes   our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes our dsp products and a portion of our analog products are manufactured at thirdparty foundries using submicron digital cmos processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts santa clara and sunnyvale california belfast northern ireland and limerick ireland we also operate assembly and test facilities located in the philippines and taiwan and use thirdparty subcontractors   some of our assembled products are assembled and tested within our us manufacturing facilities while others are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the united states or by subcontractors principally in the far east   to respond to production capacity requirements we significantly expanded our analog manufacturing capacity over the past several years much of the capacity expansion was completed by the end of fiscal 2001 when we incurred 297 million of capital spending in the two years prior to fiscal 2002 major wafer fabrication expansions were completed in wilmington massachusetts sunnyvale california and limerick ireland in fiscal 2001 we completed construction of an additional assembly and test facility in cavite philippines and have transferred substantially all of our test operations to that location in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we announced that we would transition products from our three older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our three sixinch and one eightinch wafer fabrication facilities the transition of products from and closure of our fourinch wafer fabrication facilities is expected to be completed by midfiscal 2003 capital spending in fiscal 2002 was 57 million down substantially from the 297 million incurred in fiscal 2001 because of the slowdown in our served markets we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 80 million in fiscal 2003 and capital expenditures are expected to remain low as we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels   our products require a wide variety of components most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers we have multiple sources for the majority of the components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our products however in some cases we purchase these components from solesource suppliers such as with components we purchase from external foundries if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers although we have experienced shortages of components from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed backlog   backlog at the end of fiscal 2002 was approximately 262 million up from approximately 210 million at the end of fiscal 2001 we define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead 7 times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenues 

government contracts   we estimate that approximately 5 of our fiscal 2002 total worldwide revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government competition   we compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance mixedsignal and linear signal processing components competitors for our analog mixedsignal and dsp products include cirrus logic inc linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation phillips semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments inc sales of our micromachined products are currently comprised of acceleration sensors and our main competitors in that market are bosch motorola and denso all of whom use a multichip solution we use a single chip solution that we believe provides cost reliability and functional advantages in the marketplace   we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signal processing components depends upon several factors including technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products product price customer service and technical support we believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers   many other companies offer products that compete with our products some also offer other electronic products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerlyindependent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition environment   our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position   we are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public we endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement we strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system employees   as of november 2 2002 we employed approximately 8600 persons our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highly skilled design process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us we believe that relations with our employees are good 8 










 item 2 properties   our corporate headquarters is located in norwood massachusetts manufacturing and other operations are conducted in several locations worldwide the following tables provide certain information about our principal general offices and manufacturing facilities   9   in addition to the principal leased properties listed in the previous table we also lease sales offices and other premises at 28 locations in the united states and 48 locations overseas under operating lease agreements these leases expire at various dates through the year 2020 we do not anticipate experiencing significant difficulty in retaining occupancy of any of our manufacturing office or sales facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through monthtomonth occupancy or in replacing them with equivalent facilities for information concerning our obligations under all operating leases see note 10 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations   fiscal year 2002 overview   fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for us we recorded quarterly revenues of 806 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 which represented the peak of the current cycle our revenues then declined significantly to 393 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 we then experienced a gradual sequential recovery for the last three quarters of fiscal 2002 with our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter revenue reaching 456 million our gross margins remained strong at 53 for fiscal 2002 operating expenses declined by almost 9 as a result of cost containment measures throughout our company our cash flow continued to be strong with cash increasing by over 100 million during fiscal 2002 to 2900 million after purchasing approximately 100 million of our common stock   sales   net sales were 1708 million in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 25 from net sales of 2277 million in fiscal 2001 approximately 80 of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were from analog products which decreased 26 from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 4 from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 dsp product sales represented the remaining 20 of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and decreased 22 in fiscal 2002 after declining 33 in fiscal 2001 the decreases in net sales in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve particularly the communications market as well as an overall decline in the general economy sales of new products which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters were 21 of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to 19 in fiscal 2001 the yearoveryear increase in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the introduction of record numbers of new analog ic products throughout the economic downturn experienced over the past two years   net sales were 2277 million in fiscal 2001 a decrease of 12 from net sales of 2578 million in fiscal 2000 this decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in the markets we serve particularly the communications market as well as an overall decline in the general economy sales of new products were 19 of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared to 25 in fiscal 2000 the year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products   the percentage of sales by geographic region based upon point of sale for the last three years is as follows    the fiscal 2002 decline in north american sales as a percentage of total net sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to lower cost locations primarily southeast asia sales in fiscal 2002 to japan increased slightly from fiscal 2001 as a percentage of net sales but declined by 15 in dollars fiscal 2002 sales to southeast asia increased as a percentage of net sales by 10 as compared to fiscal 2001 while increasing approximately 9 in dollars in dollars fiscal 2001 net sales decreased over fiscal 2000 by 23 in north america 3 in japan and 13 in southeast asia and increased over fiscal 2000 by 10 in europe 15   gross margin   fiscal 2002 gross margin was 905 million or 53 of net sales down 270 basis points from fiscal 2001 gross margin of 1269 million or 557 of net sales gross margin decreased to 557 in fiscal 2001 from the 567 achieved in fiscal 2000 the decline in yearoveryear gross margin for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels and lower utilization of our internal wafer fabrication facilities gross margin increased to 532 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 from 519 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 the gross margin improvement through fiscal 2002 was caused by a steady quarterly sales increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2002 combined with tight spending controls and the impact of manufacturing restructuring actions we decided that we had the opportunity to use this downturn to fundamentally and permanently reduce our manufacturing infrastructure costs worldwide in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we announced that we would transition products from our older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our sixinch and eightinch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity as a result the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately 87 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities   research and development   research and development or rd expenses amounted to 424 million in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 41 million from the 465 million recorded in fiscal 2001 included in fiscal 2002 expense is approximately 138 million of acquisitionrelated expenses compared to approximately 82 million in fiscal 2001 the increase in acquisitionrelated expense in fiscal 2002 was attributable to a full year of expense related to fixedvalue contingent compensation and the achievement of final performancebased criteria rd spending in dollars declined by 9 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 the decline in rd expenses in dollars was primarily due to the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries of our most highly compensated employees partially offset by selective hiring of engineers as a result of the decline in yearoveryear revenue rd spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2002 increased to 248 in fiscal 2002 from 204 in fiscal 2001 despite the significant decline in sales in fiscal 2002 in view of our longterm business strategy we continued to invest in rd at levels commensurate with significantly higher revenue levels than we were achieving in the short term at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future in fiscal 2001 rd expense increased to 465 million from 390 million in fiscal 2000 as a result of additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount   selling marketing general and administrative   selling marketing general and administrative or smga expenses were 257 million in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 30 million or 105 from the 287 million recorded in fiscal 2001 the decrease in smga expenses in dollars was the result of cost reduction programs including the elimination of bonuses and temporary salary reductions for our most highly compensated employees along with continued tight control over discretionary expenses as a percentage of sales smga increased to 15 for fiscal 2002 from 126 in fiscal 2001 as a result of reduced revenue levels in fiscal 2002 the industry downturn offered us the opportunity to hire experienced technicallysavvy personnel many of whom were already familiar with our products and as a result we significantly increased our field application engineers during fiscal 2002 despite the decline in net sales we decided to significantly increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products in fiscal 2001 smga expenses decreased by 6 million to 287 million from 293 million in fiscal 2000 as a percentage of sales smga increased to 126 in fiscal 2001 from 114 in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels 16   amortization of intangibles   amortization of intangibles was 57 million for fiscal 2002 compared with 53 million for fiscal 2001 and 11 million in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2003 we anticipate amortization expense to decrease to approximately 3 million as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during fiscal 2001 the increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of bco technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 and the acquisitions of thomas neuroth ag signal processing associates pty ltd integrated micro instruments inc chiplogic inc and staccato systems inc completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001   special charges   during fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges totaling 485 million and during fiscal 2001 we recorded special charges of 47 million   in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of approximately 272 million the second quarter charge included 257 million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our three sixinch and one eightinch wafer fabrication facilities and 3 million primarily related to the impairment of an investment which was offset by a 15 million adjustment to estimated equipment cancellation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001 the investment impairment which was related to an equity investment in a private company was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made included in the 257 million component of the special charge are severance and fringe benefit costs of 153 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the united states and ireland of which 182 of these employees had been terminated as of november 2 2002 23 million related to the writedown of equipment to be abandoned and 81 million of other charges primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs in addition the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities have been shortened depreciation expense included in cost of sales in fiscal 2002 included additional depreciation of approximately 87 million associated with the shortened lives of these assets the writedown of equipment was principally due to our decision to discontinue various product development strategies as of november 2 2002 there was 25 million related to these charges remaining to be paid this program is proceeding in accordance with our original plan and we expect to substantially complete these actions by midfiscal 2003 once fully complete we anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately 60 million primarily in cost of sales and the first full year’s impact will be fiscal 2004   during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of 128 million the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of 37 million related to cost reduction actions taken in several product groups and to a lesser extent in manufacturing 38 million related to the impairment of an investment 34 million impairment of goodwill related to the closure of an austrian design center we acquired in fiscal 2001 and 19 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees the investment impairment which was related to an equity investment in a private company was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made the severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering employees in the united states europe and canada and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the united states all of the manufacturing employees and approximately 32 of the engineering employees had been terminated as of november 2 2002 as of november 2 2002 there was 43 million related to these charges remaining to be paid we expect to substantially complete these actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 once fully complete we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately 10 million primarily in operating expenses   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded special charges of 84 million the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of 25 million related to cost reduction actions taken in our sales 17 group several product groups and in manufacturing for approximately 65 employees in the united states and europe of which 40 had been terminated as of november 2 2002 the charges also included 21 million related to the impairment of investments 18 million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancellation fees and a change in estimate of 2 million related to previously recorded cleanup costs the investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publiclytraded equity investment below cost basis that was determined to be otherthantemporary and of an equity investment in a private company the private company equity investment was part of a product strategy we decided to abandon as of november 2 2002 there was 31 million related to these charges remaining to be paid we expect to substantially complete these actions by the third quarter of fiscal 2003 once fully complete we anticipate the workforce reductions will result in annual savings of approximately 4 million primarily in operating expenses 

  the restructuring actions underlying the special charges accrued in fiscal 2002 are proceeding as planned the cost savings impact in fiscal 2002 of the special charges related to severance and benefits was approximately 2 million most of the remaining accrued special charge is attributable to actions planned and accrued in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 that involved the transfer of production from three separate fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our sixinch and eightinch wafer fabrication facilities which are located in massachusetts california and ireland our plan is for this transfer to be completed by midfiscal 2003   during fiscal 2001 we recorded special charges of 47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the then current economic climate the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and to a lesser extent in selling marketing and administrative areas in addition we made a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of 296 million for approximately 1200 employees in the united states europe asia and the philippines of which approximately 1010 of these employees had been terminated as of november 2 2002 the remaining 190 employees are expected to be terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as of november 2 2002 23 million of the 296 million aggregate severance cost obligations underlying the fiscal 2001 worldwide cost reduction actions had been paid the special charge also included 116 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and 58 million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancellation fees based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancellation fees the amount paid was approximately 15 million less than the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancellation fees by 15 million to reflect this change in estimate as of november 2 2002 there was 76 million related to these charges remaining to be paid we believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately 40 million consisting of a 27 million reduction in cost of sales and a 13 million reduction in operating expenses the impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately 30 million consisting of a 20 million reduction in cost of sales and a 10 million reduction in operating expenses   the restructuring actions included in the special charges recorded during fiscal 2001 are proceeding as planned of the 47 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2001 76 million remained accrued as of november 2 2002 the amount covers termination payments being paid as income continuance to 1010 terminated employees as a result of the fiscal 2001 actions as well as accrued termination payments for the remaining 190 employees expected to be terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2003   operating income   our operating income was 118 million or 69 of sales in fiscal 2002 compared to 408 million or 179 of sales in fiscal 2001 and 767 million or 298 of net sales for fiscal 2000   nonoperating income and expense   interest expense was 44 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 62 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest expense was the result of an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in january 2002 that has the effect of swapping the 475 fixed rate of our 1200 million convertible subordinated notes into a libor 18 based floating rate 161 as of november 6 2002 interest expense was 62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 6 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our 1200 million of 475 convertible subordinated notes which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 

  interest income was 65 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 133 million in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2002 as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interestbearing investments interest income was 133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 63 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in interest income was due to higher cash balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 475 convertible subordinated notes   other income decreased approximately 28 million in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 due to a onetime gain on the sale of our investment in wafertech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 other income decreased approximately 12 million in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 primarily due to a onetime gain of 44 million on the sale of our investment in chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte ltd recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 offset by the sale of wafertech described above   provision for income taxes   our effective income tax rate decreased to 250 for fiscal 2002 as compared to 297 for fiscal 2001 due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 297 for fiscal 2001 as compared to 299 for fiscal 2000 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 is expected to be approximately 220 the expected decrease is the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets”   net income   fiscal 2002 net income was 105 million or 62 of sales and diluted earnings per share was 028 compared to net income in fiscal 2001 of 356 million or 157 of sales and diluted earnings per share of 093 the fiscal 2002 decrease in net income from fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels net income decreased to 356 million in fiscal 2001 from 607 million or 236 of sales in fiscal 2000   the impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant acquisitions   during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we completed the following acquisitions  19  during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 we acquired bco technologies plc or bco a company with operations in belfast northern ireland in a cashforstock transaction valued at approximately 163 million bco is a leading supplier of silicononinsulator or soi wafers used for fabricating micromechanical devices as a result of our acquisition of bco we are incorporating soi technology into our next generation of inertial sensors in connection with this acquisition we recorded approximately 158 million of goodwill there was no inprocess research and development writeoff related to this acquisition new accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 141 or fas 141 “business combinations” and no 142 or fas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under fas 142 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives as of november 2002 we have adopted these new pronouncements application of the nonamortization provisions of fas 142 is expected to result in an increase in annual net income of approximately 54 million beginning in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2003 we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of november 3 2002   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 143 or fas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development and or the normal operation of a longlived asset except for certain obligations of lessees we are required to adopt fas 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of fas 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations   in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 or fas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of longlived assets this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business set forth in apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operationsreporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” we are required to adopt fas 144 in the first quarter of 20 fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption of fas 144 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 145 or fas 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” under fas 145 gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than extraordinary items we are required to adopt fas 145 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations   in july 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146 or fas 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” the statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring plant closing or other exit or disposal activity this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 fas 146 may affect the timing of our recognition of future exit or disposal costs if any liquidity and capital resources   at november 2 2002 we had 2898 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments compared to 2793 million at november 3 2001 the 105 million increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of 226 million or 13 of sales in fiscal 2002 and 37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans offset by a 98 million repurchase of shares of our common stock and 57 million of capital spending in fiscal 2001 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 558 million to 2793 million from 2235 million in fiscal 2000 primarily due to operating cash inflows of 844 million or 37 of sales in fiscal 2001 offset by 297 million of capital spending investing activities provided 90 million in fiscal 2002 and used 1220 million in fiscal 2001 while financing activities used 69 million in fiscal 2002 and provided 2 million in fiscal 2001   accounts receivable of 228 million at the end of fiscal 2002 increased 10 million or 47 from 218 million at the end of fiscal 2001 this increase resulted principally from a 32 million increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 days sales outstanding remained at 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales accounts receivable was 125 at the end of fiscal 2002 down from 129 at the end of fiscal 2001   inventories increased 60 million or 24 from the end of fiscal 2001 to 306 million at the end of fiscal 2002 days cost of sales in inventory increased by 24 days to 135 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 the increase in inventory in dollars was attributable to the combination of internal die bank builds and external wafer purchases the build in die bank inventory was in preparation for the transfer of production from our fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eightinch wafer fabrication facilities the external wafer purchases were in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business we are nearing the completion of the die bank build and have cut back on external wafer purchases therefore we expect that inventory will remain relatively flat in dollars during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and our days cost of sales in inventory will start to decline towards our longterm model of 100 to 110 days during fiscal 2003   net additions to property plant and equipment of 57 million in fiscal 2002 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations capital spending in fiscal 2002 was down substantially from the 297 million incurred in fiscal 2001 in response to the slowdown in our served markets we have substantially reduced our capital spending we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 80 million in fiscal 2003 capital expenditures are expected to remain low as we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels depreciation expense is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2003 from 181 million in fiscal 2002 21   we acquired five companies during fiscal 2001 as more fully described in “acquisitions” total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately 385 million in 2001 and another 52 million was paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were achieved and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 we issued 1200 million of 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2005 or 2005 notes with semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 of each year the 2005 notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased at a conversion price of 12978 per share subject to adjustment in certain events the net proceeds of the offering were 1172 million after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering which are being amortized over the term of the 2005 notes   the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of november 2 2002    at november 2 2002 our principal source of liquidity was 2898 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with current and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future critical accounting policies and estimates   management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a material effect on our financial statements   inventories   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry inventory levels obsolescence of technology and product life cycles we write down inventories to net realizable value we employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory additionally we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eightinch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory we have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates if actual demand for products is less than our estimates additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 22   longlived assets   we review property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price if any or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property plant and equipment during the past three fiscal years except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods evaluation of impairment of longlived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our longlived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets these differences could result in impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 or fas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we will adopt the new rules of fas 142 for measuring the impairment of goodwill which prescribe a fair valuebased approach the estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss if any we recognize under fas 142 upon adoption of fas 142 we will be required to make a transition test of our goodwill for impairment which may result in a significant transition impairment loss any transition impairment loss will be recorded as a change in accounting principle at least annually thereafter we will be required to test goodwill for impairment which may result in additional impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   accounting for income taxes   we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 or fas 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities fas 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance if necessary at november 2 2002 we had deferred tax assets of 159 million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities while these assets are not assured of realization we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required in reaching our conclusion we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions changes in us or international tax laws and other factors these changes if any may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made   in addition we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities although we believe our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 23   contingencies   from time to time we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others we periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 or fas 5 “accounting for contingencies” should be recorded in making this determination we may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the information we obtain combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated should a loss be probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with fas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter current status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations that may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k stock options   we have voluntarily provided the following disclosure in order to provide our stockholders with a single source for information about our stock options we believe that this disclosure combined with the disclosure provided in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and in our 2003 proxy statement provides detailed information about our stock option programs   option program description   our stock option program is a broadbased longterm employee retention program that is intended to attract retain and motivate our employees officers and directors and to align their interests with those of our stockholders we have two plans under which we currently grant stock options    substantially all of our employees participate in these plans option vesting periods are generally five years for our grants and all options have a term of ten years our option plans do not permit us to grant options at exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant these plans are critical to our efforts to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the extremely competitive semiconductor industry   options are generally granted once per year between september and january as part of our annual performance appraisal process occasionally as in fiscal year 2002 two sets of option grants can fall within one fiscal year as the process spans the end of one fiscal year and the beginning of the next fiscal year conversely as in fiscal year 1999 there are fiscal years in which no annual merit options are granted we have a goal to keep the dilution related to our option program to a longterm average of approximately 4 annually the dilution percentage is calculated as the total number of shares of our common stock underlying new option grants for the year net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by total outstanding shares of our common stock   all stock option grants to executive officers and directors can be made only from stockholder approved plans and are made after a review by and with the approval of the compensation committee of our board of directors all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as that term is defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the new york stock exchange see the “report of the compensation committee” in our 2003 proxy statement for further information regarding the policies and procedures of analog and the compensation committee regarding our grant of stock options 24   in december 2002 our board of directors adopted an amendment to each of our 2001 broadbased stock option plan and our 1998 stock option plan to provide that the terms of outstanding options under these plans may not be amended to provide an option exercise price per share which is lower than the original option exercise price per share

    forwardlooking statements   this annual report on form 10k contains or incorporates forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these forwardlooking statements are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and assumptions in addition other written or oral statements that constitute forwardlooking statements may be made by or on our behalf words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “seek” “estimate” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading “factors that may affect future results” that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements we make we do not intend to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 27 factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate   our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors competitive pricing pressures fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity the risk that our backlog could decline significantly our ability to hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers changes in product mix and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times including the decline in demand experienced since early in fiscal year 2001 our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis longterm contracts are not typical for us and reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results   in certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product at any given time this situation could affect a portion of our backlog as a result we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp falloff of sales and backlog further those orders may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets   our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products if developed will achieve market acceptance in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets also some of our customers in these markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future   many other companies offer products that compete with our products some also offer other electronic products and some have greater financial manufacturing technical and marketing resources than we have additionally some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 28 we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly we and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand that began early in fiscal 2001 as a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to thirdparty foundries however we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at thirdparty foundries or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products we believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years this expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began early in fiscal 2001 has led to overcapacity in our target markets which has resulted in a yearoveryear decline in our revenue and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results we rely on thirdparty subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers and assemblytest services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply   we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard digital processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs additionally we utilize third party wafer fabricators as solesource suppliers primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications we have no written supply agreements with these solesource suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders if these solesource suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity   our capacity additions in fiscal 2001 resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses if revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels our future operating results could be adversely affected in addition asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time should we be unsuccessful in completing this expansion on time or should customer demand fail to increase and we no longer need the additional capacity our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned   we are transitioning products from our older fourinch wafer fabrication facilities to our sixinch and eightinch wafer fabrication facilities we have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory we have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates if we are unable to transition our products as planned or if actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted our manufacturing processes are highly technical and may be interrupted   we have both generic and proprietary manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process minute impurities 29 contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages 

we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect the availability of supplies and services   we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california and taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport in addition california has experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity to date the impact on us has been negligible however electricity is a critical resource for us without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire natural disaster unavailability of electric power or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to economic political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations   during fiscal 2002 approximately 70 of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland the united kingdom the philippines and taiwan in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the response to them by the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates tax and tariff rates freight rates and social and political unrest although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties   there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience innovation and management skill there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees consultants silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests   the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers we have received from time to time and may receive in the future claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel see note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report 30 on form 10k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively   we rely primarily upon knowhow rather than on patents to develop and maintain our competitive position there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products if such patents are found to be valid there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses if required upon commercially reasonable terms or at all moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 we issued 1200000000 of 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2005 and as a result we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of interest on and other amounts due in respect of this indebtedness when due our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences this substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions it may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures it may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited   our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives   a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations termination of a significant distributor whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative could disrupt our current business if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives our operating results could be adversely affected 31 

 

   interest rate exposure   in january 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our 1200 million convertible subordinated notes the effect of the swap was to convert our 475 fixed rate to a variable rate currently based on the 3month london interbank offered rate or libor if libor increases or decreases by 100 basis points our annual interest expense would change by 12 million for fiscal 2002 changes in interest rates would affect the fair value of the interest rate swap and the fair value of the debt obligation for each basis point change in the swap curve the fair value in fiscal 2002 would change by approximately 03 million the fair value of the swap and therefore the related debt obligation would also be affected by the price and volatility of our common stock our annual interest income would change by approximately 28 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates therefore the effect to our interest income net of interest expense would be approximately 16 million in fiscal year 2002 and 24 million in fiscal 2001 the fair values of our investment portfolio at november 2 2002 and november 3 2001 would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the shortterm nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio   foreign currency exposure   as more fully described in note 2 i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months to one year the shortterm nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at november 2 2002 and november 3 2001 currently our largest foreign currency exposure is against the euro primarily because europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 2 2002 and november 3 2001 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 32

in signal processing applications   we produce a wide range of products that meet the technology needs of a broad base of customers and markets markets and applications for our products include communications computers and computer peripherals consumer electronics industrial instrumentation military and space systems and automotive electronics   during fiscal 2001 approximately 38 of our revenues came from the communications market over the past few years this market has been our fastestgrowing served market communications applications include wireless handsets and base stations as well as products used for highspeed access to the internet including ics used in adsl and cable modems and central office networking equipment   we serve the pc market with products that monitor and manage power usage process signals used in flat panel displays and multimedia projectors and enable pcs to provide cdquality audio we also serve the highend consumer market with ics used in products such as digital cameras and camcorders dvd players and surround sound audio systems during fiscal 2001 approximately 22 of our revenues were derived from the computer and consumer markets   we serve the industrial market by providing products for data acquisition systems automatic process control systems robotics environmental control systems and automatic test equipment we also provide products to the instrumentation market for use in engineering medical and scientific instruments during fiscal 2001 approximately 40 of our revenue came from the industrial market   we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force thirdparty industrial distributors and independent sales representatives we have direct sales offices in 19 countries including the united states   we are headquartered near boston in norwood massachusetts and have manufacturing facilities in massachusetts california north carolina ireland the united kingdom the philippines and taiwan founded in 1965 we employ approximately 9000 people worldwide our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol adi and is included in the standard  poor’s 500 index industry background   realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound images speed and acceleration are analog by nature consisting of continuously varying information this information can be detected and measured using analog sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuously varying voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are then usually converted to digital form for storage display or further manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing” or dsp digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as analog display audio output or control these manipulations and transformations along this signal chain are collectively known as “realworld signal processing”   significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of ics used in signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip thereby making possible much more highly integrated solutions the convergence of computing and communications requires end products that incorporate stateoftheart signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible our products are used as components in equipment and systems to achieve higher performance including greater speed improved accuracy more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption 1 principal products   we are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of a broad line of highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal processing technologies that address a wide range of realworld signal processing applications we produce and market several thousand products our highest revenue product accounted for approximately 2 of our revenue for fiscal 2001 many of our products are proprietary and equivalent products are available only from a limited number of other suppliers we also design manufacture and market a limited range of assembled products markets and applications   the following describes some of the characteristics of and products supplied to each of our major markets   communications  — the development of broadband wireless and internet infrastructures around the world has created an important market for our communications products communications technology involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form as they are processed and transmitted our expertise in combining analog and digital functionality on a single chip or chip set has enabled us to develop products that fulfill the technological challenges of this complex and rapidly expanding market space the need for ever higher speed and reduced power consumption coupled with more reliable more bandwidthefficient communications is creating increasing demand for our products which are used in systems that include digital analog and mixedsignal processing capability our products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for audio data image or video communication in broadband and wireless communication applications our products are incorporated into data and digital subscriber line dsl modems cellular telephones base station equipment and remote access servers we are also developing micromachined products for use in optical networks   computers and computer peripherals  — increased interface between users and pcs through monitors printers scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and thermal management capability in pcs have provided many opportunities in the computer market our ability to integrate analog dsp and mixedsignal functionality on ics has enabled us to supply many high performance critical components required by pc manufacturers the computer industry seeks to develop and market ever smaller and lighter personal computers this need increases demand for high performance ics to monitor power usage to enable manufacturers to use smaller batteries and extend battery life between charges we currently supply a variety of ics used in this market for functions such as graphic displays interfaces between pcs and peripherals such as modems and printers power and battery management and enhanced audio input and output capability for business and entertainment applications   consumer electronics  — increased market demand for acquisition display and digital processing of signals has allowed us to combine analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that meet the rigorous cost size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market the emergence of highperformance featurerich consumer products such as home sound systems video projectors dvd players and digital camcorders and cameras has led to the need for highperformance systemlevel ics with a high level of specific functionality   industrial  — our industrial market includes data acquisition systems automatic process control systems robotics environmental control systems and automatic test equipment these products generally require ics that offer performance greater than that available from commoditylevel ics but generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or applicationspecific ics combinations of analog and mixedsignal ics are usually employed to achieve the necessary functionality automatic test equipment applications have created opportunities for the design of systemlevel ics that require a high level of electronic circuitry   instrumentation  — our instrumentation market includes engineering medical and scientific instruments these products are usually designed using the highest performance analog and mixedsignal ics available production volumes in this space generally do not warrant custom or applicationspecific ics 2   military aerospace  — the military commercial avionics and space markets all require highperformance ics that meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications nearly all of our analog ics can be supplied in versions that meet appropriate military standards in addition many products can be supplied to meet the standards required for broadcast satellites and other commercial space applications most of our products sold in this market are derived from standard commercial grade ics   automotive  — although the automotive market has historically been served with lowcost lowperformance ics demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide range of applications in response we are developing products specifically for the automotive market we supply a micromachined ic used as a crash sensor in airbag systems which serves as an alternative to an electromechanical sensor we believe that other micromachined devices derived from this product may be suitable for other automotive applications such as rollover sensing global positioning satellite gps automotive navigation systems antilock brakes and “smart” suspension systems and nonautomotive applications including earthquake detectors and highend computer joysticks research and development   our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and processes and for significant improvement of existing products and processes we spent 465 million during fiscal 2001 related to the design development and improvement of new and existing products and processes compared to 390 million spent during fiscal 2000 and 253 million spent during fiscal 1999   in support of our research and development activities we employ hundreds of engineers involved in product and process development at several design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world   as of november 3 2001 we owned approximately 662 us patents and had 318 patent applications on file with the united states patent office we believe that while our patents may provide some advantage our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge ability and experience of our personnel the range and number of new products being developed our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts customer service and technical support ic products analog products   our analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for more than 25 years and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance singlefunction devices the majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters analogtodigital and digitaltoanalog and amplifiers other analog ic products we offer include analog signal processing devices such as analog multipliers voltage references and comparators over the past few years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas where our focus was previously limited principally interface circuits and power management ics we are also expanding our analog ic product line to better meet the needs of customers designing portable batteryoperated equipment   our analog ic products tend to be general purpose in nature this allows customers to incorporate them into a wide variety of equipment and systems our product portfolio includes several hundred analog ics any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers analog ics typically have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both original equipment manufacturers oems and customers who build equipment for their own use most of our analog ics have been purchased by oems to serve the instrumentation industrial and military aerospace markets but during the past few years they have been increasingly used for applications in communications computers camcorders scanners automatic test equipment imaging and other consumer applications requiring highperformance realworld signal processing by using standard highperformance readily available offtheshelf components in their designs our 3 customers can reduce the time they need to develop and bring new products to market given the high cost of developing customized ics analog ics usually provide the most costeffective solution for low to medium volume applications in addition combinations of analog ics connected together on a printed circuit board can provide functionality not currently achievable using a single ic 

  other analog ics include circuits that are designed to serve the needs of particularly demanding applications such as very high speed analog timing and pin driver circuits needed by oems in the automatic test equipment business manufacturers of portable instrumentation need analog ics designed to address demanding battery life requirements and need similar kinds of functions available in analog ic products integrated into a single very lowpower chip other principal requirements include higher accuracy lower cost per function smaller size lower weight and fewer components for improved reliability these applicationspecific products allow our customers to design smaller lighter higher performance more powerefficient and lowercost end products we believe that these benefits have become more important to our oem customers as they increase their focus on highperformance small lightweight products many of which are batterypowered general purpose dsp products   our dsp products are designed to efficiently execute specialized software programs algorithms associated with processing digitized realtime realworld data generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write their own algorithms using software tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from thirdparty suppliers all of these devices share a common architecture that allows system designers to address cost performance and timetomarket constraints we support these products with specialized applications and easytouse lowcost design tools which reduce product development costs and time to market mixedsignal products   our products also include multifunction mixedsignal devices that incorporate combinations of analog and digital technology the growing need to allow user interface with computers and consumer products as well as the development of communications systems has created new opportunities for these mixedsignal devices examples of these devices include chipsets for communication applications gsm cellular phones remote access servers data and fax modems audio inputoutput devices and power and thermal management devices for computer applications and electric motor control devices micromachined products   our technology base includes a number of new products using an advanced ic technology known in the industry as surface micromachining this technology enables extremely small mechanical structures to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electromechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the micromachined sensing element   our micromachined products are accelerometers used in a wide variety of applications the majority of current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications emerging applications include gps automobile navigation systems earthquake detectors and highend computer joysticks we are also engaged in the development of micromachined products for use in alloptical switching elements in optical networks general purpose and custom products   across the entire range of ics that we design and manufacture are general purpose products as well as custom products designed for specific applications for specific customers in many of the new emerging markets in communications computer and consumer products there is a tendency to work with selected major customers to design applicationspecific solutions which can combine elements of analog digital mixedsignal and micromachined functionality 4 assembled products   our assembled products include multichip modules mcms hybrids and printed circuit board modules an mcm is a device made up of several ic chips assembled in an automated fashion in a multilayer package that provides high interconnect density at low cost a hybrid consists of several chips and discrete components mounted and wired together on a substrate which is then enclosed in a package a printedboard module consists of surfacemount components assembled on a small printed board that is then encapsulated in a small plastic case   revenues from this product group have been declining for several years primarily because hybrids are being replaced in many new designs with smaller lowercost monolithic ics that offer higher levels of performance and integration sales of these products are approximately 3 of our total sales sales channels   we sell our products in north america and internationally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors and independent sales representatives approximately 39 of our fiscal 2001 net sales were to customers in north america as of december 1 2001 we had 12 sales offices in the united states and our thirdparty distribution channel consisted of six national and regional thirdparty distributors and several independent sales representatives in numerous locations throughout the us and canada   approximately 24 of our fiscal 2001 net sales were to customers in europe 15 to customers in japan and 22 to customers in other international markets as of december 1 2001 we had direct sales offices in australia austria brazil canada china denmark france germany hong kong india israel italy japan korea the netherlands singapore sweden taiwan and the united kingdom we also had sales representatives andor distributors in approximately 46 countries outside north america including countries where we also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding geographic information see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this report   a significant portion of our fiscal 2001 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products some of them also sell products competitive with our products including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued   our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength databooks shortform catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide web site on the internet we maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products during their product development cycles   for fiscal 2001 our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 30 of our net sales the largest single customer represented approximately 3 of net sales production and raw materials   monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual “chips” or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals ceramic packages and plastic used for packaging   we develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear mixedsignal and systemlevel ics we also use industrystandard bipolar and cmos wafer fabrication processes 5   our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators we rely primarily on our own facilities for fabricating wafers that require linear and mixedsignal processes we operate wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts santa clara and sunnyvale california belfast northern ireland and limerick ireland we also operate assembly and test facilities located in ireland the philippines and taiwan and also use thirdparty subcontractors we have agreements with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte ltd csm for the production of digital and very large scale integration mixedsignal devices to provide access to advanced process technology at competitive costs we participated in the formation of a joint venture wafertech llc with tsmc altera integrated silicon solutions and several individual investors that built a fabrication facility for eightinch wafers in camas washington originally we had an 18 equity ownership in wafertech in fiscal 1999 we sold 78 of our investment to other wafertech partners in exchange for 105 million in cash which was equal to 78 of the carrying value of the equity ownership at october 31 1998 during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we completed the sale of our remaining investment in wafertech llc to tsmc for approximately 61 million in cash we recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately 28 million   hybrid products are manufactured by mounting and connecting together several integrated circuit chips in a single package we manufacture some of the chips used in our hybrids and purchase others from outside suppliers the production process for modular components subsystems and systems consists primarily of assembly packaging and testing some of our assembled products are assembled and tested within our us manufacturing facilities and at us subcontractors while others are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the united states or by subcontractors principally in the far east   to respond to production capacity requirements we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity over the past several years major wafer fabrication expansions were completed in wilmington massachusetts sunnyvale california and limerick ireland in fiscal 2001 we completed construction of an additional assembly and test facility in cavite philippines we expect that our capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 will be approximately 70 million compared to 297 million in fiscal 2001 backlog   backlog at the end of fiscal 2001 was approximately 210 million down from approximately 1062 million at the end of fiscal 2000 we define backlog as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks while backlog has declined primarily as a result of the lower demand for our products from the year earlier period it has also been impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand in periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenues government contracts   we estimate that approximately 4 of our fiscal 2001 total worldwide revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government contractors and subcontractors our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the united states government competition   we compete with a large number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of highperformance linear and mixedsignal signalprocessing components competitors for our analog mixedsignal and dsp products include cirrus logic inc linear technology corp maxim integrated products inc motorola semiconductor products national semiconductor corp phillips semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments inc sales of our 6 micromachined products are currently comprised of acceleration sensors and our main competitors are bosch motorola and denso which use a multichip solution we use a single chip solution that we believe provides cost reliability and functional advantages in the marketplace 

  many other companies offer products that compete with our products some also offer other electronic products and some have financial resources substantially larger than ours also some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies   we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld signalprocessing components depends upon several factors including product price technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products customer service and technical support we believe our aggressive technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to continue to compete successfully in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers environment   our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position employees   as of november 3 2001 we employed approximately 9000 persons our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highly skilled design process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us we believe that relations with our employees are good 7

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations   net sales were 2277 million in fiscal 2001 a decrease of 12 from net sales of 2578 million in fiscal 2000 the decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve particularly the communications market as well as an overall decline in the general economy fiscal 2001 analog ic product sales decreased 3 from fiscal 2000 our analog ic product sales were strong in the first half of the year and declined in line with a major downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the last half of fiscal 2001 our fiscal 2001 dsp ic product sales decreased 32 from the prior year due to order cancellations and adjustments particularly from telecommunications customers and contract manufacturers sales of new products which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters were 19 of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with 25 in fiscal 2000 the year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products   net sales were 2578 million in fiscal 2000 an increase of 78 over net sales of 1450 million in fiscal 1999 this increase in net sales was attributable to continued growth in the markets we serve sales into all end markets increased in fiscal 2000 with the communications market representing the largest growth area   the percentage of sales by geographic region for the last three years is as follows    as set forth above the fiscal 2001 decline in north american sales as a percentage of total sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry sales to international regions remained strong in the first half of fiscal 2001 but weakened in the latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry in absolute dollar terms sales to europe increased by 10 in fiscal 2001 sales in fiscal 2001 to japan remained relatively flat to fiscal 2000 as both a percentage of sales and in absolute dollar terms fiscal 2001 sales to southeast asia remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal 2000 while declining approximately 13 in absolute dollars in fiscal 2000 sales to europe declined as a percentage of total sales largely due to a weakening euro us dollar exchange rate over fiscal 1999 in absolute dollars fiscal 2000 net sales increased over fiscal 1999 by 72 in north america 61 in europe 75 in japan and 114 in southeast asia these large sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand that was not sustainable   gross margin was 1269 million or 557 of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared to 1461 million or 567 of net sales in fiscal 2000 gross margin declined by 100 basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our internal fabs the increase in gross margin in fiscal 2000 to 567 from the 493 achieved in fiscal 1999 was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as production increased at our wafer fabrication assembly and test facilities gross margin declined to 52 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of a 47 sales decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000   research and development rd expense amounted to 465 million in fiscal 2001 an increase of 75 million over fiscal 2000 additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount were the main reason for the year over year increase as a result of the decline in the year to year revenue rd spending as a percentage of sales increased to 204 from 151 in fiscal 2000 at any point in time we have hundreds of rd projects underway and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product 13 leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant rd investments in the future in fiscal 2000 rd expense increased to 390 million from 253 million in fiscal 1999 

  amortization of intangibles was 53 million for fiscal 2001 compared with 11 million for fiscal 2000 the increase in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of bco technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 and the acquisition of thomas neuroth ag signal processing associates pty ltd integrated micro instruments inc chiplogic inc and staccato systems inc completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001   during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we completed the following acquisitions   14    during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 we acquired bco technologies plc bco a company with operations in belfast northern ireland in a cashforstock transaction valued at approximately 163 million bco is a leading supplier of silicononinsulator wafers used for fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical switching and communications applications in connection with this acquisition we recorded approximately 158 million of goodwill there was no inprocess research and development writeoff related to this acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 1999 we acquired two dsp tools companies white mountain dsp inc of nashua new hampshire wm and edinburgh portable compilers limited of edinburgh scotland epc the total cost of these acquisitions was approximately 23 million with additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of 10 million payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and operational objectives as of november 3 2001 all of the additional cash consideration has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price in connection with the acquisitions of wm and epc we recorded a charge of 51 million for the writeoff of inprocess research and development   selling marketing general and administrative smga expenses were 287 million in fiscal 2001 a decrease of 6 million from the 293 million in fiscal 2000 as a percentage of sales smga increased to 126 for fiscal 2001 from 114 in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels in fiscal 2000 smga expenses increased 83 million from 210 million in fiscal 1999 as a percentage of sales smga decreased to 114 in fiscal 2000 from 145 in fiscal 1999 as a result of increased sales   during fiscal 2001 we recorded a special charge of approximately 47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the current economic climate the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities workforce reductions also occurred to a lesser extent in selling marketing and administrative areas as of november 3 2001 the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of approximately 30 million for approximately 1200 employees in the us europe asia and the philippines of which approximately half of these employees were terminated as of november 3 2001 the special charge also included approximately 12 million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations we believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately 40 million with a 27 million reduction in cost of sales and a 13 million reduction in operating expenses the impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings is expected to be approximately 30 million with a 20 million reduction in cost of sales and a 10 million reduction in operating expenses   our operating income was 408 million or 179 of sales for fiscal 2001 compared to 767 million or 298 of sales in fiscal 2000 and 243 million or 167 of net sales for fiscal 1999   in fiscal 1999 we sold 78 of our investment in wafertech llc wafertech to other wafertech partners in exchange for 105 million in cash which was equal to 78 of the carrying value of the equity ownership at october 31 1998 during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we completed the sale of our remaining investment in wafertech to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company for approximately 61 million in cash we recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately 28 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 we sold our investment in chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte ltd we received proceeds of approximately 65 million in cash and realized a pretax gain of approximately 44 million these realized gains are included in other nonoperating income   interest expense was 62 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 6 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our 1200 million of 475 convertible subordinated notes which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 interest income was 133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 63 million in fiscal 2000 the increase in interest income was due to higher cash 15 balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 475 convertible subordinated notes 

  our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 297 for fiscal 2001 as compared to 299 for fiscal 2000 primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining wafertech investment our effective income tax rate increased to 299 for fiscal 2000 from 236 in fiscal 1999 due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions principally the united states   fiscal 2001 net income was 356 million or 157 of sales and diluted earnings per share was 093 compared to net income in fiscal 2000 of 607 million and diluted earnings per share of 159 the fiscal 2001 decrease in net income from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels net income increased to 607 million or 236 of sales in fiscal 2000 from 197 million or 136 of sales in fiscal 1999   effective october 29 2000 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 133 fas 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 138 “accounting for certain instruments and certain hedging activities” fas 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value under certain circumstances a portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci until the hedged transaction affects earnings for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately while the adoption of fas 133 on october 29 2000 did not have a material impact on operations it resulted in a 5 million loss recognized in oci which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001   in august 2001 the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin 101 sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” sab 101 summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 141 fas 141 “business combinations” and no 142 fas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under fas 142 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives we must adopt these new pronouncements no later than november 2002 with earlier adoption permitted application of the nonamortization provisions of fas 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately 54 million beginning in fiscal 2003 we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect if any the adoption of fas 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results of operations   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 143 fas 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs it also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development and or the normal operation of a longlived asset except for certain obligations of lessees we are required to adopt fas 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption of fas 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations   in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 fas 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of longlived assets this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and the accounting and reporting provisions for 16 the disposal of a segment of a business of apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operationsreporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” we are required to adopt fas 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not yet determined what effect if any the adoption of fas 144 will have on our financial position or results of operations 

  the impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant liquidity and capital resources   at november 3 2001 we had 2793 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments compared to 2235 million at october 28 2000 the 558 million increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of 844 million 37 of fiscal 2001 sales offset by 297 million of capital spending in fiscal 2000 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by 1473 million primarily due to operating cash inflows of 705 million or 27 of sales in fiscal 2000 and 1172 million of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt offset by 275 million of capital spending and 169 million of acquisitionrelated spending investing activities used 1220 million in fiscal 2001 and 456 million in fiscal 2000 while financing activities generated 2 million in fiscal 2001 and 1130 million in fiscal 2000   accounts receivable of 218 million at the end of fiscal 2001 decreased 246 million or 53 from 464 million at the end of fiscal 2000 this decrease resulted principally from a 382 million decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 days sales outstanding improved from 52 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales accounts receivable was 129 at the end of fiscal 2001 down from 144 at the end of fiscal 2000   inventories decreased 85 million or 26 from fiscal 2000 to 247 million at the end of fiscal 2001 days cost of sales in inventory increased by 21 days to 111 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 the decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is attributable to production decreases in response to reduced demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied by external foundries we employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates if actual demand for products is less than our estimates additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods   net additions to property plant and equipment of 297 million for fiscal 2001 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations capital spending in fiscal 2001 increased slightly from the 275 million incurred in fiscal 2000 significant fiscal 2001 capital additions included new facilities in wilmington ma sunnyvale ca and limerick ireland we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately 70 million in fiscal 2002 depreciation expense is expected to increase to 171 million in fiscal 2002 from 158 million in fiscal 2001   we acquired five companies during fiscal 2001 as more fully described in “results of operations” total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately 38 million   during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 we issued 1200 million of 475 convertible subordinated notes due 2005 2005 notes with semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 of each year commencing april 1 2001 the 2005 notes are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased at a conversion price of 12978 per share subject to adjustment in certain events the net proceeds of the offering were 1172 million after payment of 17 the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering which will be amortized over the term of the 2005 notes after the issuance of the 2005 notes our debttoequity ratio increased to 53 

  at november 3 2001 our principal sources of liquidity were 2793 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments   we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations together with current and anticipated available longterm financing will be sufficient to fund operations capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future forwardlooking statements   the “management analysis” and other sections of this report contain forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management in addition other written or oral statements that constitute forwardlooking statements may be made by or on our behalf words such as “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “seek” “estimate” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict see “factors that may affect future results” below therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forwardlooking statements we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise factors that may affect future results 

 

   our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors competitive pricing pressures fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity the risk that our backlog could decline significantly our ability to hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers changes in product mix and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets in addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times including the recent decline in demand experienced during fiscal 2001 our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance depending on the mix of future business that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them as a result of these and other factors there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

   our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products if developed will achieve market acceptance in addition our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets also some of our customers in these markets are less well established which could subject us to increased credit risk 18 

 

   the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive some of our competitors have greater technical marketing manufacturing and financial resources than we do our competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets that we serve our competitors have in some cases developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

 

   the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or shortterm periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly we and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand in fiscal 2001 as a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to thirdparty foundries however we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at thirdparty foundries or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products we believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years this expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began in early fiscal 2001 has led to overcapacity in our target markets which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we rely and plan to continue to rely on assembly and test subcontractors and on thirdparty wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard digital processes this reliance involves several risks including reduced control over delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs 

 

   our capacity additions resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses if revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels our future operating results could be adversely affected in addition asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time 

 

   we and many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california and taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry including temporary loss of capacity availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport in addition california has recently experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity to date the impact on us has been negligible however electricity is a critical resource for us without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions 

 

   during fiscal 2001 61 of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland the united kingdom the philippines and taiwan in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the 19 us economy in general including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the response to them of the united states and its allies these risks include air transportation disruptions expropriation currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates tax and tariff rates and freight rates and social and political unrest although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies 

 

   the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights we have from time to time received and may in the future receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel see note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 3 2001 for information concerning pending litigation that involves us an adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 

 

   we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of interest on and other amounts due in respect of this indebtedness when due our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences this substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions it may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures it may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 


 

 

   we have fixed rate debt obligations and interest rate swap and cap agreements an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations because of the size and structure of these obligations a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material change in our interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 due mainly to the shortterm nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio the related interest income would change by approximately 6 million for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for fiscal 2001 on a weighted average portfolio maturity of 93 days the impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material for fiscal 2000 due mainly to the relative insignificance of interest income to the consolidated pretax income   as more fully described in note 2 i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we regularly hedge our nonus dollarbased exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to one year the shortterm nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at november 3 2001 and october 28 2000 currently our largest foreign currency 20 exposure is against the euro primarily because europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated expenses relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november 3 2001 and october 28 2000 a 10 unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our yearend exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ products become more or less attractive our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

industry background

     realworld phenomena such as temperature pressure sound images speed
and acceleration are inherently analog in nature consisting of continuously
varying information this information can be detected and measured using analog
sensors which represent realworld phenomena by generating continuously varying
voltages and currents the signals from these sensors are initially processed
using analog methods such as amplification filtering and shaping they are
then usually converted to digital form for storage display or further
manipulation the further manipulation of the signals after conversion to
digital form is called digital signal processing or dsp in addition digital
signals are frequently converted to analog form to provide signals for functions
such as analog display audio output or control these manipulations and
transformations are known collectively as realworld signal processing

     significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have led
to substantial increases in the performance and functionality of ics used in
signal processing applications these advances include the ability to combine
analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip to offer much
more highly integrated solutions the convergence of computing and
communications requires end products that incorporate stateoftheart
signalprocessing capability with as few chips as possible our products are
used as

                                        1

components in equipment and systems to achieve higher performance which
includes higher speed and higher accuracy and more efficient signal processing
while minimizing power consumption

principal products

     we are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of a broad line of
highperformance ics that incorporate analog mixedsignal and digital signal
processing technologies that address a wide range of realworld signal
processing applications we have a generic list of approximately 2000 products
with the highest revenue product accounting for approximately 4 of our revenue
for fiscal 2000 many of our products are proprietary while equivalents to
other products are available from a limited number of other suppliers we also
design manufacture and market a range of assembled products

markets and applications

     the following describes some of the characteristics of and products
supplied to each of our major markets

     communications  the rapid development of broadband and wireless
communications infrastructure around the world combined with the development of
the internet has created a rapidly growing market for our products
communications technology involves the acquisition of analog signals that are
converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form as they are
processed and transmitted our expertise in combining analog and digital
functionality on a single chip has enabled us to develop products that fulfill
the technological challenges of this complex and rapidly expanding market space
the need for ever higher speed and reduced power consumption coupled with more
reliable more bandwidthefficient communications is creating increasing demand
for our products which are used in systems that include digital analog and
mixedsignal processing capability the products are used in the full spectrum
of signal processing for audio data image or video communication in broadband
and wireless communication applications our products are incorporated into data
and digital subscriber line dsl modems cellular telephones base station
equipment and remote access servers we are also engaged in the development of
micromachined products that may result in alloptical switching elements for use
in optical networks

     computers and computer peripherals  increased interface between users and
the pc through monitors printers scanners and audio devices and the increasing
need for power and thermal management capability in pcs have provided many
opportunities in the computer market our ability to integrate analog dsp and
mixedsignal functionality on ics has enabled us to supply many high performance
critical components required by pc manufacturers the computer industry requires
smaller lighter personal computers creating increased demand for high
performance ics to monitor power usage thereby allowing manufacturers to use
smaller batteries and extend battery life between charges we currently supply a
variety of ics used in this market for functions such as graphic displays
interfaces between pcs and peripherals such as modems and printers power and
battery management and enhanced audio input and output capability for business
and entertainment applications

     consumer electronics  the acquisition and display of signals combined
with the requirement for digital processing of these signals have allowed us to
combine analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that conform
to the rigorous cost size and reliability constraints of the consumer
electronics market the emergence of highperformance consumer products such as
compact disc players dvd players and digital camcorders and cameras has led to
the need for highperformance systemlevel ics with a high level of specific
functionality the addition of monitoring and motor control devices on many
consumer products has also created new opportunities for us

     industrial  our industrial market includes data acquisition systems
automatic process control systems robotics environmental control systems and
automatic test equipment these products generally require ics that offer
performance greater than that available from commoditylevel ics but generally
do not have production volumes that warrant custom or applicationspecific ics
combinations of analog and mixedsignal ics are usually employed to achieve the
necessary functionality except in automatic test equipment

                                        2
page   4

applications where the high level of electronic circuitry required per tester
has created opportunities for the design of systemlevel ics

     instrumentation  our instrumentation market includes engineering medical
and scientific instruments these products are usually designed using the
highest performance analog and mixedsignal ics available where production
volumes generally do not warrant custom or applicationspecific ics

     militaryaerospace  the military commercial avionics and space markets
all require highperformance ics that meet rigorous environmental and
reliability specifications nearly all of our analog ics can be supplied in
versions that meet appropriate military standards in addition many products
can be supplied to meet the standards required for broadcast satellites and
other commercial space applications most of our products sold in this market
are derived from standard commercial grade ics although we sometimes develop
products expressly for militaryaerospace applications

     automotive  although the automotive market has historically been served
with lowcost lowperformance ics demand has emerged for higher performance
devices for a wide range of applications in response we are developing
products specifically for the automotive market we supply a micromachined ic
used as a crash sensor in airbag systems which serves as an alternative to an
electromechanical sensor we believe that other micromachined devices derived
from this product may be suitable for other automotive applications such as
rollover sensing global positioning satellite gps automotive navigation
systems antilock brakes and smart suspension systems and other applications
including earthquake detectors and highend computer joysticks

research and development

     the market we serve are characterized by rapid technological changes and
advances accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and
development of new products and processes and for significant improvement of
existing products and processes we incurred 401 million during fiscal 2000
related to the design development and improvement of new and existing products
and processes compared to 257 million and 219 million during fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998 respectively

     in support of our research and development activities we employ hundreds
of engineers involved in product and process development at several design
centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world

     as of october 28 2000 we owned approximately 595 us patents and had 211
patent applications on file with the united states patent office we believe
that while our patents may provide some advantage our competitive position is
largely determined by such factors as the knowledge ability and experience of
our personnel new product development market recognition and ongoing marketing
efforts customer service and technical support

ic technology

  analog technology

     analog ic technology has been the foundation of our business for more than
25 years and we believe we are one of the worlds largest suppliers of analog
ics our analog ics are primarily highperformance singlefunction devices the
majority of our analog ic product revenue is attributable to sales of data
converters analogtodigital and digitaltoanalog and amplifiers other
analog ic products offered by us include analog signal processing devices such
as analog multipliers voltage references and comparators over the past few
years we have been expanding our analog ic product offerings into product areas
where our focus was previously limited principally interface circuits and power
management ics we are also expanding our analog ic product line to include a
much larger number of products designed to operate from singlesupply 3 or 5
volt power sources to better meet the needs of customers designing portable
batteryoperated equipment

     our analog ic products tend to be general purpose in nature which allows
customers to incorporate them in a wide variety of equipment and systems our
product portfolio includes several hundred analog ics any

                                        3
page   5

one of which can have as many as several hundred customers analog ics typically
have long product life cycles our analog ic customers include both oems and
customers who build equipment for their own use historically most analog ics
have been purchased by oems that serve the instrumentation industrial and
militaryaerospace markets but they are now also being used for applications in
communications computers camcorders scanners automatic test equipment
imaging and other consumer applications requiring highperformance realworld
signal processing by using standard highperformance readily available
offtheshelf components in their designs our customers can reduce the time
required to develop and bring new products to market given the high cost of
developing customized ics analog ics usually provide the most costeffective
solutions for low to medium volume applications in addition combinations of
analog ics connected together on a printed circuit board can provide
functionality not currently achievable using a single ic

     other analog ics include circuits that are designed to serve the needs of
particularly demanding applications eg very high speed analog timing and pin
driver circuits needed by oems in the automatic test equipment business
manufacturers of portable instrumentation need analog ics designed to address
demanding battery life requirements and need similar kinds of functions
available in analog ic products integrated into a single very lowpower chip
other principal requirements can include higher accuracy lower cost per
function smaller size lower weight and fewer components for improved
reliability these application specific products allow our customers to design
smaller lighter higher performance more powerefficient and lowercost end
products we believe that these benefits have become more important to our oem
customers as they increase their focus on highperformance small lightweight
products many of which are batterypowered

  general purpose dsp technology

     our products that include dsp technology are designed to efficiently
execute specialized programs algorithms associated with processing digitized
realtime realworld data generalpurpose dsp ic customers typically write
their own algorithms using software tools provided by us and software tools
obtained from thirdparty suppliers all of these devices share a common
architecture which allows system designers to address cost performance and
timetomarket constraints we support these products with specialized
applications and easytouse lowcost design tools which reduce product
development costs and time to market

  mixedsignal technology

     our product range also includes multifunction mixedsignal devices which
incorporate combinations of analog and digital technology the growing need to
allow user interface with computers and consumer products as well as the
development of communications systems has created new opportunities for these
mixedsignal devices examples of these devices include chipsets for
communication applications gsm cellular phones remote access servers data and
fax modems audio inputoutput devices and power and thermal management devices
for computer applications and motor control devices

  micromachined technology

     our technology base includes a number of new products using an advanced ic
technology known in the industry as surface micromachining this technology
enables extremely small mechanical structures to be built on the surface of a
chip along with supporting circuitry in addition to incorporating an electro
mechanical structure these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning
signals obtained from the micromachined sensing element

     our micromachined products are accelerometers used in a wide variety of
applications the majority of current revenue from micromachined products is
derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
applications emerging applications include gps automobile navigation systems
earthquake detectors and highend computer joysticks we are also engaged in the
development of micromachined products that may result in alloptical switching
elements for use in optical networks

                                        4

  general purpose and custom products

     across the entire range of ics designed and manufactured by us there are
general purpose products and custom products designed for specific applications
for specific customers in many of the new emerging markets in communications
computer and consumer products there is a tendency to work with selected large
customers to design applicationspecific solutions which can combine elements of
analog digital mixedsignal and micromachined functionality

assembled product technology

     our assembled products technology includes multichip modules mcms
hybrids and printed circuit board modules an mcm is a device made up of several
ic chips assembled in an automated fashion in a multilayer package that provides
high interconnect density at low cost a hybrid consists of several chips and
discrete components mounted and wired together on a substrate which is then
enclosed in a package a printedboard module consists of surfacemount
components assembled on a small printed board that is then encapsulated in a
small plastic case

     revenues from this product group have been declining for several years
primarily because hybrids are being replaced in many new designs with smaller
lowercost monolithic ics that offer higher levels of performance and
integration sales of these products have declined to approximately 2 of our
total sales

sales channels

     we sell our products in both north america and internationally through a
direct sales force thirdparty distributors and independent sales
representatives approximately 45 of our fiscal 2000 net sales came from
customers in north america as of december 1 2000 we had 13 sales offices in
the united states and our thirdparty distribution channel consisted of six
national and regional thirdparty distributors and several independent sales
representatives at numerous locations throughout the us and canada

     approximately 19 of our fiscal 2000 net sales came from sales to customers
in europe 14 to customers in japan and 22 to customers in other
international markets as of december 1 2000 we had direct sales offices in
australia austria canada china denmark france germany hong kong india
israel italy japan korea the netherlands singapore sweden taiwan and the
united kingdom we also had sales representatives andor distributors in
approximately 40 countries outside north america including countries where we
also have direct sales offices for further detail regarding geographic
information see note 4 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
incorporated herein by reference to the 2000 annual report to shareholders and
filed herewith as part of exhibit 132

     approximately 40 of our fiscal 2000 revenue was derived from sales made
through distributors these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our
products some of them also sell products competitive with our products
including those for which we are an alternate source sales to certain
distributors are made under agreements which provide protection to the
distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and
products that are slowmoving or that we have discontinued

     our worldwide sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional
program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade
publications direct mail programs promotional brochures technical seminars
and participation in trade shows we publish and distribute fulllength
databooks shortform catalogs applications guides technical handbooks and
detailed data sheets for individual products we also provide product and
application information via our worldwide web site on the internet and we
started to sell products on the internet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999
we also maintain a staff of application engineers who aid customers in
incorporating our products into their products during their product development
cycles

     for fiscal 2000 our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 36
of our net sales the largest single customer represented approximately 8 of
net sales

production and raw materials

     monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of
semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing
cutting the wafer into individual chips or dice assembly of the dice into
packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form the raw
materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing
chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals ceramic packages and
plastic used for packaging

     we employ a wide variety of companydeveloped proprietary processes
specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance linear
mixedsignal and systemlevel ics we also use industrystandard bipolar and
cmos wafer fabrication processes

     our ic products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by
thirdparty wafer fabricators we rely primarily on our own facilities for
fabricating wafers that require linear and mixedsignal processes we operate
wafer fabrication facilities in wilmington and cambridge massachusetts santa
clara and sunnyvale california belfast northern ireland and limerick
ireland we also operate assembly and test facilities located in the united
states ireland the philippines and taiwan and also use thirdparty
subcontractors we have agreements with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing
company tsmc and chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte ltd csm
for the production of digital and very large scale integration mixedsignal
devices to provide access to advanced process technology at competitive costs
we participated in a joint venture agreement wafertech llc with tsmc altera
integrated silicon solutions and several individual investors that built a
fabrication facility for eightinch wafers in camas washington originally we
had an 18 equity ownership in wafertech in january 1999 we concluded an
agreement to sell to other wafertech partners 78 of our equity ownership in
wafertech for cash equal to our carrying value at october 31 1998 subsequent
to our fiscal year ended october 28 2000 we realized approximately 61 million
from the sale of our remaining interest in wafertech to tsmc realizing a net
pretax gain of approximately 28 million

     hybrid products are manufactured by mounting and connecting together
several integrated circuit chips in a single package some of the chips used in
our hybrids are manufactured by us and some are purchased from outside
suppliers the production process for modular components subsystems and systems
consists primarily of assembly packaging and testing some of our assembled
products are assembled and tested within our us manufacturing facilities
while others are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the united
states or by subcontractors principally in the far east

     to respond to production capacity requirements we significantly expanded
our manufacturing capacity over the past several years major wafer fabrication
expansions were completed in wilmington massachusetts santa clara california
and limerick ireland also in fiscal 2000 we began construction of an
additional assembly and test facility in cavite philippines we expect that our
capital expenditures for fiscal 2001 will be approximately 450 million

backlog

     backlog at the end of fiscal 2000 was approximately 1062 million up from
approximately 446 million at the end of fiscal 1999 the increase in the
backlog is a result of the rapid increase in demand for our products from the
year earlier period this is the result of increased demand for our products in
the rapidly growing communications computer and consumer products markets in
periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times which
has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have
manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders as is customary in the
semiconductor industry we include customers forecast orders in backlog and
allow such orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without
significant penalty accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should
not be used as an indication of future revenues

                                        6

government contracts

     we estimate that approximately 4 of our fiscal 2000 total worldwide
revenue was attributable to sales to the us government and government
contractors and subcontractors our government contract related business is
predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts all such
contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination
at the election of the united states government

competition

     we compete with a large number of semiconductor companies in markets that
are highly competitive we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of
highperformance linear and mixedsignal signalprocessing components
competitors for our analog mixedsignal and dsp products include cirrus logic
inc harris corp linear technology corp lucent technologies inc maxim
integrated products inc motorola semiconductor products national
semiconductor corp sierra semiconductor corp siliconix inc and texas
instruments inc sales of our micromachined products currently comprise
acceleration sensors and our main competitors are bosch motorola and denso
which use a multichip solution whereas we use a single chip solution that we
believe provides cost reliability and functional advantages in the marketplace

     many other companies offer components that compete with our products some
also offer other electronic products and some have financial resources
substantially larger than ours also some formerly independent competitors have
been purchased by larger companies however to our knowledge no manufacturer
competes with us across all of the product types offered by us in our
signalprocessing components product line

     we believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for realworld
signalprocessing components depends upon several factors including product
price technical innovation product quality and reliability range of products
customer service and technical support we believe our aggressive technical
innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our
commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to
continue to compete successfully in our chosen markets against both foreign and
domestic semiconductor manufacturers

environment

     our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and
regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our
capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

employees

     as of october 28 2000 we employed approximately 9100 persons our future
success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and
senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain
and motivate qualified employees particularly those highly skilled design
process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and
the development of new products and processes the competition for such
personnel is intense and the loss of key employees could have a material
adverse effect on us we believe that relations with our employees are good
