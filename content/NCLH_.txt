our company 

business overview 

we are a leading global cruise company which operates the norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises brands as of december 31 2021 we had 28 ships with approximately 59150 berths and had orders for nine additional ships to be delivered through 2027 due to covid19 we temporarily suspended all global cruise voyages from march 2020 until july 2021 when we resumed cruise voyages on a limited basis we refer you to “—impact of covid19” for further information

our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including europe asia australia new zealand south america africa canada bermuda caribbean alaska and hawaii norwegian’s usflagged ship pride of america provides the industry’s only entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii

all of our brands offer an assortment of features amenities and activities including a variety of accommodations multiple dining venues bars and lounges spa casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices all brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage

we have nine ships on order across our portfolio of brands for the norwegian brand we have six prima class ships on order with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 for regent seven seas cruises we have one explorer class ship on order for delivery in 2023 for oceania cruises we have two allura class ships on order for delivery in 2023 and 2025 these additions to our fleet will increase our total berths to approximately 83000 which includes additional berths we plan to add to our prima class ships subject to certain conditions the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged 

impact of covid19 

due to the impact of covid19 travel restrictions and limited access to ports around the world in march 2020 the company implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands in the third quarter of 2021 we began a phased relaunch of certain cruise voyages with ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels 

beginning in december 2021 the spread of the omicron variant of covid19 with its increased transmissibility caused several operational challenges and disruptions including new travel restrictions and increased protocols in ports of call limiting port availability which led to the cancellation of certain voyages in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022 and the postponement of the restart of certain vessels as of the date hereof 16 of our 28 ships or 70 of our berth capacity are operating with guests on board this excludes a vessel which was paused from service beginning december 2021 due to the cancellation of its south africa and related itineraries as a result of travel restrictions and other operational challenges due to the omicron variant we expect to have approximately 85 of capacity operating by the end of the first quarter of 2022 with the full fleet expected to be back in operation during the early part of the second quarter of 2022 

in connection with the expiration of the temporary extension and modification of framework for conditional sailing order on january 15 2022 the cdc announced that it would be implementing the covid19 program for cruise ships operating in us waters the “program” a voluntary covid19 risk mitigation program for foreignflagged cruise ships operating in us waters the cdc released details regarding the program in february 2022 which we have reviewed we currently remain opted into the program as part of our sailsafe health and safety program our sailsafe global health and wellness council chaired by former head of the us food and drug administration dr scott gottlieb continues to advise the company on health and safety protocols in light of advancements in medicine and technology 

our selection of itineraries in the shortterm will be predicated by port availability and the safety of the destinations we visit we continue to work with our partners at ports as well as governmental agencies to address the impact that covid19 will have on future operations including the ability to receive guests potential capacity restrictions and the need for physical distancing and other health guidelines that may be imposed on guests onboard the ship in port facilities and while in the destinations we visit our goal is to provide a safe and healthy cruise vacation while at the same time keeping the guest experience as authentic as possible

all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets and onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing however sales of cruises are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions as a result of covid19 there are severe negative impacts on consumer spending as well as our travel advisors’ operations and their ability to book cruises refer to “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—update regarding covid19 pandemic” for additional information

​ 

strategy for covid19 

​ 

the company has taken several actions in response to the impact on our business brought on by the covid19 pandemic 

addressed significant operational challenges 

health and safety 

in response to the public health environment brought on by the covid19 pandemic we have developed sailsafe tm  a comprehensive and multifaceted health and safety strategy to enhance our already rigorous protocols and address the unique public health challenges posed by covid19 in july 2020 we announced a collaboration with royal caribbean group to form a group of experts called the “healthy sail panel” to guide the industry in the development of new and enhanced cruise health and safety standards the panel is cochaired by dr scott gottlieb former commissioner of the us food and drug administration and governor mike leavitt former secretary of the us department of health and human services and consists of globally recognized experts from various disciplines including public health infectious disease biosecurity hospitality and maritime operations the panel’s recommendations have informed new detailed health and safety protocols for our returntoservice plan 

the company also further extended its depth and breadth of experts with the formation of its sailsafe global health and wellness council comprised of four experts at the forefront of their fields and led by chairman dr scott gottlieb 

the council’s work complements the healthy sail panel initiative and focuses on the implementation compliance with and continuous improvement of health and safety protocols across the company’s operations the company continues to work with its expert advisors the healthy sail panel and global public health authorities and government agencies to refine its comprehensive and multilayered health and safety strategy to enhance its already rigorous health and safety standards in response to covid19 

port availability 

in preparation for our resumption of operations we coordinated closely with the homeports and ports of call around the world in which we had previously operated based on the openness and availability of ports we drafted a voyage resumption plan with a slate of voyages which we have modified as additional ports opened or temporarily closed for cruise traffic due to varied embarkation and disembarkation requirements by port we are implementing processes to inform passengers of local regulations and requirements we remain in contact with ports of call to ensure accessibility and any need for modifications due to port availability 

execution of financial action plan 

we continue to take proactive measures to enhance liquidity and financial flexibility in the current environment in march 2021 we received additional financing through various debt financings and an equity offering collectively totaling 27 billion in gross proceeds from the proceeds approximately 15 billion was used to extinguish debt in november 2021 the company executed a 1 billion commitment through august 15 2022 that provides additional liquidity to the company also in november 2021 we received additional financing through a debt financing and an equity offering collectively totaling 23 billion in gross proceeds from the proceeds approximately 20 billion was used to extinguish debt in addition in february 2022 we received additional financing through various debt financings collectively totaling 21 billion in gross proceeds all of which has been or will be used to redeem all of the outstanding 2024 senior secured notes and 2026 senior secured notes and to make principal payments on debt maturing in the shortterm including in each case to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon as well as related premiums fees and expenses refer to note 8 – “longterm debt” for further details about the above transactions 

we also undertook several proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the reduction of capital expenditures and deferral of debt amortization as well as a reduction in operating expenses including ship operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses refer to “ item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources ” for more detail regarding our covid19 financial action plan 

resumption of operations 

we began a phased relaunch of cruise voyages in july 2021 initially each newly launched ship is expected to operate at reduced occupancy which will gradually increase over time we plan to continue gradually launching ships from each brand through the early part of the second quarter of 2022 based on the current conditions we are planning for all ships to sail at full capacity by the end of 2022 the timing for returning ships to service the level of occupancy on our ships and the percentage of our fleet in service will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic further resurgences and new more contagious andor vaccineresistant variants of covid19 the availability distribution rate of public acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 our ability to comply with governmental regulations and implement new health and safety protocols port availability travel restrictions bans and advisories and our ability to restaff certain ships refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further details regarding the uncertainties of returning to sailing at full fleet capacity and “item 1a risk factors—if our phased restart of cruise operations does not resume as planned we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities” for details regarding the potential effect of delays on our debt covenants

our covid19 vaccination policy requires that all guests with the exception of guests under the age of 12 on norwegian cruise line sailings beginning march 1 2022 and all crew must be vaccinated in the us certain states have enacted legislation prohibiting companies from verifying the vaccination status of guests we challenged such a 

prohibition in florida in court and received a preliminary injunction allowing us to operate as planned as a result of regulatory requirements and other logistical challenges the timeline for our ability to return our entire fleet to cruises is fluid nevertheless we continue to work with other federal agencies public health authorities and national and local governments in areas where we operate to take all necessary measures to protect our guests crew and the communities visited as we continue to resume operations

convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel or twice in five years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed three years depending on flag state and age of vessel however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every five years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability we take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guestfacing services and innovative compliance technology

nclh and nclc are exempted companies formed under the laws of bermuda and some of their subsidiaries have been formed in bermuda guernsey isle of man british virgin islands cayman islands or the bahamas pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws are required to demonstrate substantial economic substance in that jurisdiction in general terms substantial economic substance means i the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction ii core incomegenerating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction iii there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction iv the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction and v there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction we have evaluated the activities of nclh nclc and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases those activities are relevant activities for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that consequently certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements we may be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions if such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements we may be liable for penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions andor required to redomicile such entities to different jurisdictions 

environmental protection 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge wastewater management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various water and air qualityrelated requirements

with regard to air quality requirements the imo convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 various compliance methods such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized

marpol also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated emission control areas “ecas” which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel north american waters and the us caribbean sea ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods ecas have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen from newly built ships additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around norway japan and the mediterranean sea being considered

ballast water discharges are governed by the marpol ballast water management convention which came into force in 2017 “the convention” and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization may contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different or potentially unsuitable environments applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species

marpol also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage oil and sewage from ships including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage without causing delay to ships ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited unless they comply with resolution mepc 22764 adopted by the marine environmental protection committee “mepc” of the imo stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021

these requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” and the us coast guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federallyprotected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” program authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vesselspecific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping in 2018 the vessel incidental discharge act “vida” which will eventually replace the vgp was signed into law and in october 2020 the epa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish national standards of performance under vida that would apply to 20 different types of vessel equipment and systems as well as general discharge standards that would apply to all types of vessel incidental discharges the vgp has been administratively extended while standards under vida are being developed with certain exceptions vida requires that the new standards be at least as stringent as the vgp requirements

the act to prevent pollution from ships which implements certain elements of marpol in the us provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases the laws have no statutory limits of liability among the most stringent requirements are those set by the state of alaska which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state 

waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

the european union “eu” has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the eu requires the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports all noneca waters have a 05 fuel sulfur limit with regard to carbon dioxide emissions in july 2021 the eu published proposed legislation that would extend its emissions trading system to the maritime transport sector under the proposal ships over 5000 gross tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from eu member state ports would be required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage depending on whether the voyage was between two eu ports or an eu and a noneu port the requirements are proposed to be phased in from 2023 to 2026 beginning in 2023 covered entities would be required to surrender allowances equivalent to 20 of their verified emissions with the amount increasing to 45 in 2024 70 in 2026 and 100 in 2026

in 2021 the imo adopted two new requirements going into effect in 2023 the carbon intensity indicator the “cii” and energy efficiency ship index the “eexi” which each regulate carbon emissions for ships the cii is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile ships are given an annual rating from a to e with a c or better required for compliance for ships that receive a d rating for three consecutive years or an e rating for one year a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved in 2023 ships will be required to reduce carbon intensity by 5 from a 2019 baseline with 2 incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030 the eexi is a design recertification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power transport capacity and ship speed

compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and the purchase of emissions allowances increase costs for compliant newbuilds render some ships obsolete significantly increase costs for alternative fuels and require changes in operating procedures including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations or slowing the speed of our ships which could adversely impact our operations these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

permits for glacier bay alaska 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through september 30 2029 

passenger and crew wellbeing 

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the cdc and the fda we have rated at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

currently we are working directly with the cdc maritime unit as well as other health regulatory authorities such as eu healthy gateways to adjust our covid19 response protocols we refer you to “—strategy for covid19—resumption of operations” for further information

security and safety 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

maritimelabor 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers as amended “stcw” establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

financial requirements 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 320 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments 

in addition our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the uk and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions as of december 31 2021 we have in place approximately £481 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £511 million the company has provided approximately 289 million in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required

compliance with these regulations has had an impact on our financial condition from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general we cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see “part i item 1arisk factors” in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs andor decreased revenue”

taxation 

us income taxation 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” the nyse is considered to be an established securities market in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs’ interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

for 2021 2020 and 2019 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “ussource shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to us federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 21 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our ussource shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of ussource shipping income and substantially all of our ussource shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our ussource shipping income the “4 tax regime”

other united states taxation 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land 

packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

uk income taxation 

nclh and nclc are tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

changes in tax laws 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

human capital 

at nclh our culture is defined by our corporate values of flawless execution dedication to family and community spirit of entrepreneurship financial excellence and environmental stewardship these values were internally developed and are authentic to our company as they define success in our culture and establish the foundation upon which it is built we believe our culture and commitment to our team members attract and retain top talent while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately results in significant value to our company and its shareholders

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business if any of the risks discussed or additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the covid19 pandemic has also had the effect of heightening many of the risks described below the ordering of the risk factors below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

​ 

covid19 and debtliquidity related risk factors 

​ 

covid19 has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial condition and operations the current and uncertain future impact of the covid19 pandemic including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel including on cruises is expected to continue to impact our results operations outlook plans goals growth reputation cash flows liquidity demand for voyages and share price 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have significant negative impacts on all aspects of our business in march 2020 we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands we began resuming cruise voyages in july 2021 in a phased manner as part of our return to service plan we expect the remaining ships in our fleet will continue incrementally resuming voyage operations through the early part of the second quarter of 2022 but due to the uncertainties surrounding the covid19 pandemic we have cancelled some announced restart cruise voyages and delayed the expected restart dates for some of our ships it may take us longer than expected to return our entire fleet to cruise voyage operations andor the suspension could potentially be reinstated and the total length of time the majority of our fleet is out of cruise voyage operations or operating at significantly reduced occupancy levels may be prolonged in addition we have been and will continue to be further negatively impacted by related developments including heightened governmental regulations travel advisories travel bans and restrictions including those implemented by the us department of state the cdc the department of homeland security and other state federal and international governments and regulators each of which has impacted and is expected to continue to significantly impact global guest sourcing and our access to various ports of call around the globe additionally in the us certain states have enacted legislation prohibiting companies from verifying the vaccination status of guests which in some instances we have challenged in court as a result of these requirements and other logistical challenges the timeline for our ability to return our entire fleet to cruises is fluid we expect to continue to incur significant covid19 related costs in relation to these regulations and as we implement and maintain healthrelated protocols on our ships such as controlled capacity and testing which have had and may continue to have a significant effect on our operations we have had instances of covid19 on our ships and there is no guarantee that the health and safety protocols we implement will be successful in preventing the spread of covid19 onboard our ships and among our passengers and crew

​ 

to date the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant costs and lost revenue as a result of the suspension of cruise voyages implementation of additional health and safety measures reduced demand for cruise vacations guest compensation itinerary modifications redeployments and cancellations travel restrictions and advisories the unavailability of ports andor destinations protected commissions costs to return our passengers to their home destinations and expenses to transport our crew to and from our ships and to assist some of our crew with quarantine or isolation and food and housing in the event they are prevented from returning home in an optimal time frame

​ 

our ability to transport crew to and from our ships is dependent on a number of factors including the ability to transport crew members to and from their home countries due to the limited number of commercial flights and charter options available and governmental restrictions and regulations with respect to disembarking crew members and travel generally additionally our policy that crew members must be fully vaccinated has created logistical challenges due to limitations on vaccine supplies logistical complexities relating to vaccinating crew members who reside in different countries around the world and vaccine hesitancy such restrictions on crew travel and challenges in making sure our crew members have been vaccinated has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to staff our ships as operations continue to resume

​ 

we have been and may continue to be the subject of lawsuits and investigations stemming from covid19 for example in march 2020 the florida attorney general announced an investigation related to our marketing during the covid19 pandemic following the announcement of the investigation by the florida attorney general we received notifications from other attorneys general and governmental agencies that they are conducting similar investigations we cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material

​ 

we have nine newbuilds on order scheduled to be delivered through 2027 the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged

​ 

demand for cruises may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if and when each brand will return to prepandemic demand or pricing levels due to the discretionary nature of leisure travel spending and the competitive nature of the cruise industry our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the us economy and economies in other regions of the world unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted and may result in the future in decreased demand for cruise vacations changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors all of which in turn have had and may continue to have in the future a strong negative effect on our business in particular our bookings may be negatively impacted by enhanced health and safety protocols including vaccination requirements concerns that cruises are susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases as well as adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate including higher unemployment rates declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of covid19 the ongoing covid19 pandemic and associated disruption to economic activity is expected to have a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and in turn is expected to depress demand for cruise vacations into the foreseeable future in addition we cannot predict the impact covid19 will have on our partners such as travel agencies suppliers and other vendors we may be adversely impacted by any adverse impact our partners suffer the global supply chain has also been negatively impacted by covid19 which has had an effect on our operations and our ability to source supplies we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and our cash flows required for cash refunds of fares for cancelled sailings as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the public’s concern regarding the health and safety of travel including by cruise ship and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising depending on the timing for bringing our full fleet back in service and number of cancellations we may be required to provide cash refunds for a substantial portion of the balance of our advance ticket sales accordingly as a result of these unprecedented circumstances we cannot predict the full impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

moreover our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends in part upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public’s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally as well as regarding the cruise industry and our ships actual or perceived risk of infection could have an adverse effect on the public’s perception of the company which could harm our reputation and business additionally some of our protocols such as our requirement that all guests with the exception of guests under the age of 12 on norwegian cruise line sailings beginning march 1 2022 and all crew must be vaccinated for our initial voyages may attract negative publicity

​ 

as a result of the impacts of covid19 provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements have and may continue to adversely affect our liquidity we have agreements with several credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and provide other services under these agreements the credit card companies could under certain circumstances and upon written notice require us to maintain a reserve which reserve would be funded by the credit card companies withholding or offsetting our credit card receivables or our posting of cash or other collateral as a 

result of the impacts of covid19 we have seen an increase in demand from consumers for refunds on their tickets and we anticipate this will continue to be the case for the near future as of december 31 2021 we had cash collateral reserves of approximately 12 billion with credit card processors recognized in accounts receivable net or other longterm assets we may be required to pledge additional collateral andor post additional cash reserves or take other actions that may further reduce our liquidity as a consequence our financial position and liquidity could be further materially impacted

​ 

as a result of all of the foregoing we expect to report a net loss until we are able to resume regular voyages our ability to forecast our cash inflows and additional capital needs is hampered and we could be required to raise additional capital in the future our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing the terms and conditions of our existing debt agreements and any agreements governing future indebtedness our prospects and our credit ratings since march 2020 moody’s and sp global have both downgraded our credit ratings if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted accordingly there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations

​ 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs the terms of any instruments governing future indebtedness may also require us to provide incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations our ability to incur future indebtedness could be impacted by the accuracy of any appraisals of our assets as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise

​ 

the extent of the effects of the pandemic on our business and the cruise industry at large is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments many of which are outside of our control including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic including the severity and transmission rates of more contagious andor vaccineresistant variants of covid19 the availability distribution rate of public acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 the duration and scope of related federal state and local government orders and restrictions the extent of the impact of covid19 on overall demand for cruise vacations and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and normal economic and operating conditions to resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted covid19 has also had the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein such as those relating to our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness

​ 

additionally epidemics pandemics and viral outbreaks or other wideranging health scares in the future would likely also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

if our phased restart of cruise operations does not resume as planned we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities 

​ 

certain of our debt facilities include maintenance and financial covenants for example under the senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain a loan to value ratio of no less than 070 to 100 financial covenants include free liquidity of no less than 200000000 at all times a total net funded debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 086 to 100 on march 31 2023 085 to 100 on june 30 2023 and 083 to 100 at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter and an ebitda to consolidated debt service ratio of at least 125 to 100 at the end of each fiscal quarter unless free liquidity is greater than or equal to 200000000 at that time the testing of the covenants under the senior secured credit facility 

has been suspended to and including december 31 2022 with the exception of the free liquidity test as a result of the covid19 pandemic we paused our global fleet cruise operations from march 2020 until july 2021 although we resumed our cruise voyages on a limited basis in july 2021 if we are unable to recommence our normal operations in the time period and manner expected or if we must again pause our voyages we may be out of compliance with some or all of the maintenance and financial covenants in certain of our debt facilities if we expect to not be in compliance we would expect to seek waivers from the lenders under these facilities or renegotiate these facilities prior to any covenant violation

​ 

any covenant waiver or renegotiation of any of our debt facilities has led and may in the future lead to increased costs increased interest rates additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under these debt facilities and such increased costs restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities will be limited by the restrictions in our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers or renegotiate these facilities in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all if we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities we would be in default of such agreements which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements as a consequence we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities if we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate these facilities there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities

​ 

with respect to each of these debt facilities if we were unable to or did not obtain a waiver renegotiate or refinance or repay such debt facilities it would lead to an event of default under such facilities which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities in turn this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which includes a significant portion of our assets including our ships any such action would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations as a result the failure to obtain the covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations

​ 

we anticipate that we will need additional financing in the future which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

​ 

we anticipate that we will need additional equity andor debt financing to fund our operations in the future especially if our phased resumption of cruise voyages does not progress as expected we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all depending on market and other conditions the ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control including general economic and market conditions the health of financial institutions our credit ratings and investors’ and lenders’ assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the cruise industry in general all of which may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements and we may be required to further encumber our assets we may not have sufficient available collateral to pledge to support additional financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures which could negatively affect our business our credit ratings which have been downgraded as a result of the impact on our business of the covid19 pandemic could be further downgraded which could have an impact on the availability andor cost of financing in addition we may conclude that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern which could have additional effects on our credit ratings and the availability andor cost of financing there can be no assurance that our ability to access the credit andor capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy if we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows andor borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets our business and financial condition could be adversely affected and it may be necessary for us to reorganize our company in its entirety including through bankruptcy proceedings and our shareholders may lose their investment in our ordinary shares

​ 

if we raise additional funds through equity andor debt issuances nclh’s shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities could have rights preferences and privileges that are superior to that of holders of nclh’s ordinary shares further the exchange of some or all of our outstanding exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of nclh’s shareholders upon exchange of any of the exchangeable notes any sales in the public market of nclh’s ordinary shares issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of nclh’s ordinary shares in addition the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling by market participants that engage in hedging or arbitrage activity and anticipated exchange of any of the exchangeable notes into nclh ordinary shares could depress the price of nclh’s ordinary shares

​ 

our indebtedness and the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a substantial majority of our assets are collateral under our debt agreements 

​ 

a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy and the industry in which we operate we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness which may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

​ 

in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay dividends or make distributions to nclh repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

​ 

any further impairment of our trade names or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

​ 

we evaluate trade names and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable several factors including a challenging operating environment such as the operating environment created by the covid19 pandemic impacts affecting consumer demand or spending the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s trade name or goodwill we recognized significant impairment losses during 2020 related to the covid19 pandemic we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments however a change in our estimated future operating cash flows may result in a decline in fair value in future periods which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges 

​ 

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

​ 

economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties 

under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

​ 

in 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulated the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced its intention to phase out libor by the end of 2021 and the alternative reference rates committee selected the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the rate recommended to replace us dollar libor “usd libor” in december 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the administrator of libor released a consultation disclosing that it would cease publication of oneweek and twomonth usd libor after december 31 2021 but continue to publish the remaining tenors of usd libor for an additional 18 months through june 30 2023 these remaining tenors of usd libor—overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12months—encompass the tenors referenced in certain of our borrowings and interest rate swaps however uncertainty remains as many market participants await the development of term sofr products ie forwardlooking rates and indices that might coexist with sofr in addition recent new york state legislation effectively codified the use of sofr as the alternative to libor in the absence of another chosen replacement rate which may affect contracts governed by new york state law

​ 

we plan to transition away from libor as a reference rate in the coming months we will need to amend our credit facilities to determine replacement rates which may result in interest payments that differ from our original expectations and which may materially impact the amount of our interest payments under our variable rate debt we will also need to consider any new contracts and whether they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the alternative reference rates committee additionally sofr is calculated based on shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities sofr is observed and backward looking which stands in contrast with libor which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results

​ 

operational related risk factors 

​ 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to health safety and environmental concerns existing capacity constraints security adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes floods typhoons and earthquakes financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies the covid19 pandemic has at times limited the number of ports that are able and willing to accommodate passenger cruise voyages and we expect these limitations will continue as the prevalence of covid19 fluctuates in certain destinations in the past regulatory changes have prohibited us from visiting ports in destinations like cuba and we have temporarily changed certain itineraries in the caribbean due to damage some ports sustained from hurricanes there can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future due to environmental and overcrowding concerns some local governments have begun to take measures to limit the number of cruise ships and passengers allowed at certain destinations for example dubrovnik venice and barcelona have either implemented or considered implementing such limitations on cruise ships and passengers limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports have adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations in the past and could do so in the future

​ 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes significant delays and disruptions or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

​ 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of health and safety events strikes or other staffing shortages weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example many commercial airlines have reduced services and experienced staffing shortages and other disruptions due to the covid19 pandemic covid19 related regulations have also sometimes prevented us from using commercial airline services to transport our crew members to and from our ships which has resulted in increased costs to our company

​ 

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

​ 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

​ 

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes floods and typhoons fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs and the frequency and severity of natural disasters may increase due to climate change the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships in the past and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us the expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified could have an adverse impact on demand which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor increased expenditures

​ 

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

​ 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates inflation higher taxes changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade trade disputes and increased tariffs could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

​ 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations subject us to significant fines penalties and damages and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and disruptions to these systems or networks could impair our operations have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters information systems failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks our business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security may not prevent disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information the security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business we experience cyberattacks of varying degrees on our systems and networks and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyberattacks can include computer viruses malware worms hackers and other malicious software programs or other attacks including physical and electronic breakins router disruption sabotage or espionage disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denialofservice attacks for example in october 2018 we discovered limited instances of unauthorized access to certain employee email communications some of which contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information we have implemented additional safeguards and we do not believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident however there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in addition we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches unauthorized access or other cyberattacks or incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents our failure to successfully prevent mitigate or timely respond to such incidents could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation

​ 

we are also subject to laws in multiple jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data noncompliance with these laws or the compromise of information systems used by us or our service providers resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests employees or vendors could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment the regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another

​ 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems or a cyberattack or other cyber incident we may incur costs associated with the following response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement data restoration regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees damages and settlements in addition data security breaches a cyberattack or other cyber incident may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data loss of company assets damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

​ 

changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices 

​ 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel including more costly alternate fuel sources would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations for example as of january 2020 the imo’s convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships marpol set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the previous 35 global limit various compliance methods such as the use of lowsulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized we have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet which will allow us to continue to use highsulfur fuel on those ships in certain areas however if exhaust gas cleaning systems are not widely used in the industry low demand for highsulfur fuel may increase the price for such fuel ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning systems and in specified areas even ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems will be required to use lowsulfur fuels lowsulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities we may also be required to use alternate fuel sources in the future as additional regulations aimed at reducing carbon intensity are introduced or in order to achieve any emissions reductions targets we may adopt for example the imo adopted two new requirements going into effect in 2023 the carbon intensity indicator and energy efficiency ship index which each regulate carbon emissions for ships in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

​ 

mechanical malfunctions and repairs delays in our shipbuilding program maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair for example in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

​ 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of 

prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business currently the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis additionally we are reliant on a third party to oversee certain newbuild and drydock projects any occurrence that prevented such third party from continuing to oversee such projects or substantially increased the costs related to such oversight could have an adverse effect on our operations these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

​ 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

​ 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

​ 

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business currently we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain crew members any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

​ 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

​ 

the impacts of and uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic may make it more difficult to retain crew members to restaff our fleet as we continue our phased relaunch of ships and to recruit new employees generally

​ 

impacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

there has been an increased focus on greenhouse gas and other emissions from global regulators consumers and other stakeholders regulations addressing climate change that have already been adopted or are being considered as described under “risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate” may have significant adverse impacts to our profitability and operations in addition concern about climate change may cause consumers to avoid certain kinds of travel including cruise and air travel which could impact our ability to source guests increasing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions may attract scrutiny from investors and may make it more difficult for us to raise capital our ships port facilities corporate offices and island destinations may also be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change we may be required or choose to make significant investments in technology equipment and alternative fuels in order to achieve any climaterelated targets we may set and our profitability and operations may be adversely impacted by such investments

​ 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

there can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we or other members of our protection and indemnity associations were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected for example in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

​ 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

​ 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

​ 

the us government announced that effective may 2 2019 it will no longer suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of 1996 popularly known as the helmsburton act allowing certain individuals whose property was confiscated by the cuban government beginning in 1959 to sue anyone who traffics in the property in question in us courts a claim against us is pending and additional claims may be brought against us in the future if these suits are successful they could result in substantial monetary damages against the company lawsuits and investigations stemming from covid19 have also been brought against us and we may be subject to additional lawsuits and investigations related to covid19 in the future we cannot predict 

the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material

​ 

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

​ 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

​ 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

​ 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

​ 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

​ 

our expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and landbased destination projects may not be successful 

​ 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets in the future such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations we have also made and plan to continue to make investments in landbased projects including port facilities and destination projects that are susceptible to impacts from among other things weather events regulatory restrictions labor risks shortages of goods and materials and resistance from local populations any such impacts to our landbased projects could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

​ 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add nine additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations additionally older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices

​ 

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

​ 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs andor decreased revenue 

​ 

increasingly stringent and complex international federal state and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union individual countries the united states and individual states have implemented and are considering new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol imo’s requirements governing environmental protection and stcw an imo regulation governing ship manning in the united states the environmental protection agency and the us coast guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations

​ 

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at restricting or taxing emissions including those of greenhouse gases requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels requiring the use of shore power while in port increasing fuel efficiency requirements reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities for example marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships ships operating in designated ecas are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems in 2021 the imo adopted two new requirements going into effect in 2023 the carbon intensity indicator the “cii” and energy efficiency ship index the “eexi” which each regulate carbon emissions for ships the cii is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile ships are given an annual rating from a to e with a c or better required for compliance for ships that receive a d rating for three consecutive years or an e rating for one year a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved in 2023 ships will be required to reduce carbon intensity by 5 from a 2019 baseline with 2 incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030 the eexi is a design recertification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power transport capacity and ship speed in addition in july 2021 the eu published proposed legislation that would extend its carbon dioxide emissions trading system to the maritime transport sector under the proposal ships over 5000 gross tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from eu member state ports would be required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage depending on whether the voyage was between two eu ports or an eu and a noneu port the requirements are proposed to be phased in from 2023 to 2026 beginning in 2023 covered entities would be required to surrender allowances equivalent to 20 of their verified emissions with the amount increasing to 45 in 2024 70 in 2026 and 100 in 2026

​ 

compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and the purchase of emissions allowances increase costs for compliant newbuilds render some ships obsolete significantly increase costs for alternative fuels and require changes in operating procedures including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations or slowing the speed of our ships which could adversely impact our operations these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact

​ 

additionally in the past states have implemented taxes that impact the cruise industry it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

​ 

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

​ 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

​ 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business—taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

​ 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

​ 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

​ 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

​ 

our ability to comply with economic substance requirements in certain jurisdictions and increased costs and efforts associated with our efforts to comply may have a negative impact on our operations 

​ 

our company and certain of its subsidiaries may be subject to economic substance requirements in their jurisdictions of formation including but not limited to bermuda guernsey isle of man british virgin islands cayman islands the bahamas saint lucia and marshall islands pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws are required to demonstrate substantial economic substance in that jurisdiction in general terms substantial economic substance means i the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction ii core incomegenerating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction iii there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction iv the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction and v there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction we have evaluated the activities of nclh nclc and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases those activities 

are relevant activities for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that consequently certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements we may be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions if such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements we may be liable to penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions andor required to redomicile such entities to different jurisdictions that may have tax regimes and other regulatory regimes which may be less favorable 

​ 

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

​ 

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 

​ 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

​ 

nclh does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

​ 

nclh does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

​ 

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

​ 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests for instance these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include i the ability of nclh’s board of directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval ii a classified board of directors iii the sole power of a majority of nclh’s board of directors to fix the number of directors iv the power of nclh’s board of directors to fill any vacancy on nclh’s board of directors in most circumstances including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise and v advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings

​ 

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions may preclude third parties 

from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months however our cruise voyages were completely suspended from march 2020 until july 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic and our resumption of cruise voyages will be phased in gradually as described under “—update regarding covid19 pandemic” below passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment port fees and taxes and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services and photo services our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated 

financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to liquidity ship accounting and asset impairment

we make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our liquidity 

significant events affecting travel including covid19 typically have an impact on demand for cruise vacations with the full extent of the impact generally determined by the length of time the event influences travel decisions we believe the ongoing effects of covid19 on our operations and global bookings have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our financial results and liquidity and such negative impact may continue beyond the containment of the pandemic 

the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties our principal assumptions for future cash flow projections include

 

due to the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic further resurgences and new more contagious andor vaccineresistant variants of covid19 the availability distribution rate of public acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 our ability to comply with governmental regulations and implement new health and safety protocols port availability travel restrictions bans and advisories and our ability to restaff certain ships we cannot predict with certainty when our full fleet will be back in service at historical occupancy levels our projected liquidity requirements reflect our principal assumptions surrounding ongoing operating costs as well as liquidity requirements for financing costs and necessary capital expenditures 

we cannot make assurances that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements may not change because we have never experienced a complete cessation and resumption of our cruise voyages accordingly the full effect of our suspension of cruise voyages on our financial performance and financial condition cannot be quantified at this time we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of covid19 within our financial statements and there may be material changes to those estimates in future periods the company has taken and will continue to take proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of covid19 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship when we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship’s cost basis we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship’s cost basis repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

we determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull the useful lives of ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components in addition to determine the useful lives of the ship or ship components we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets manufacturer recommended lives and anticipated changes in technological conditions given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher in 2020 one ship had significant improvements that extended the remaining weighted average useful life of the vessel accordingly we updated our estimate of both its useful life and residual value based on the new weighted average useful life of its current components the impact of the change in estimate was accounted on a prospective basis and was not material

if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated weighted average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2021 would have increased by 162 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 764 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

asset impairment 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for ship impairment analyses the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates judgments and projections as necessary our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk

we evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment on december 31 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill we use a qualitative assessment which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value for trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment

in order to make this evaluation we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist



 

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships goodwill tradenames and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge if a material change occurred or the result of the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value we would conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value to its carrying value 

we have concluded that our business has three reporting units each brand oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment 

for our annual impairment evaluation we performed a qualitative assessment for the regent seven seas reporting unit and of each brand’s trade names as part of our analysis we performed an assessment of the key assumptions impacting the quantitative tests performed in 2020 and performed sensitivities on cash flow projections discount rates and royalty rates as of december 31 2021 there was 981 million of goodwill remaining for the regent seven seas reporting unit trade names were 5005 million as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 our annual impairment reviews support the carrying values of these assets 

​ 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these and other nongaap financial measures we utilize net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to manage our business on a daytoday basis in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance as a result of our voluntary suspension of sailings from march 2020 until july 2021 we did not have any capacity days during the suspension period accordingly we have not presented herein per capacity day data for the years ended december 31 2021 or 2020

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

in addition adjusted net income loss and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income loss and eps we use adjusted net income loss and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation during normal operations the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net income loss and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 16 billion related to impairment losses we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income loss since the expenses are not representative of our daytoday operations however this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this form 10k

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

update regarding covid19 pandemic 

​ 

suspension of cruise voyages 

​ 

due to the impact of covid19 travel restrictions and limited access to ports around the world in march 2020 the company implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands in the third quarter of 2021 we began a phased relaunch of certain cruise voyages with ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels 

​ 

beginning in december 2021 the spread of the omicron variant of covid19 with its increased transmissibility caused several operational challenges and disruptions including new travel restrictions and increased protocols in ports of call limiting port availability which led to the cancellation of certain voyages in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022 and the postponement of the restart of certain vessels as of the date hereof 16 of our 28 ships or 70 of our berth capacity are operating with guests on board this excludes a vessel which was paused from service beginning december 2021 due to the cancellation of its south africa and related itineraries as a result of travel restrictions and other operational challenges due to the omicron variant we continue to execute on the phased relaunch plans for our 28ship fleet we expect to have approximately 85 of capacity operating by the end of the first quarter of 2022 with the full fleet expected to be back in operation during the early part of the second quarter of 2022 refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further details regarding the uncertainties of returning to sailing at full fleet capacity and “item 1a risk factors—if our phased restart of cruise operations does not resume as planned we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities” for details regarding the potential effect of delays on our debt covenants

​ 

in connection with the expiration of the temporary extension and modification of framework for conditional sailing order on january 15 2022 the cdc announced that it would be implementing the covid19 program for cruise ships operating in us waters the “program” a voluntary covid19 risk mitigation program for foreignflagged cruise ships operating in us waters the cdc released details regarding the program in february 2022 which we have reviewed we currently remain opted into the program as part of our sailsafe health and safety program our sailsafe global health and wellness council chaired by former head of the us food and drug administration dr scott gottlieb continues to advise the company on health and safety protocols in light of advancements in medicine and technology

​ 

as a result of the unprecedented circumstances caused by the pandemic we are not able to predict the full impact of the pandemic on our company refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further details regarding the significant impact the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on our financial condition and operations 

​ 

modified policies 

​ 

our brands have launched cancellation policies for certain sailings booked during certain time periods to permit our guests to cancel cruises which were not part of a temporary suspension of voyages up to 15 days or 48 hours prior depending on the brand to embarkation and receive a refund in the form of a credit to be applied toward a future cruise these programs were in place for cruises booked through specific time periods specified by brand certain cruises booked for certain periods will be permitted a 60day cancellation window for refunds the future cruise credits issued under these programs are generally valid for any sailing through december 31 2022 and we may extend the length of time these future cruise credits may be redeemed the use of such credits may prevent us from garnering certain future cash collections as staterooms booked by guests with such credits will not be available for sale resulting in less cash collected from bookings to new guests we may incur incremental commission expense for the use of these future cruise credits in addition to provide more flexibility to our guests we have also extended our modified final payment schedule for most voyages on regent seven seas cruises through july 31 2022 for certain voyages on oceania cruises through june 30 2022 and for all voyages on norwegian cruise line through april 30 2022 which now requires payment 60 days prior to embarkation versus the standard 120 days

​ 

update on bookings 

​ 

net booking volumes at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021 continued to demonstrate substantial weekoverweek sequential growth after the slowdown in booking activity caused by the delta variant of covid19 net booking volumes in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2021 began to be negatively impacted by the omicron variant of covid19 primarily for closein voyages in the first and second quarters of 2022 in recent weeks as the omicron wave subsided net booking trends have improved sequentially as a result the company’s current cumulative booked position for the first half of 2022 is below the strong levels of 2019 at higher prices even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits while booked position for the second half when the full fleet is expected to be back in operation is in line with the comparable 2019 period and at higher prices also including the impact of future cruise credits booked position for each quarter compared to the comparable quarter in 2019 improves sequentially through the year booking trends for 2023 demonstrate continued strong demand for sailings with booked position and pricing higher and at record levels when compared to bookings for 2020 in 2019 our full fleet may not resume operations on our expected schedule and as a result current booking data may not be informative in addition because of our updated cancellation policies bookings may not be representative of actual cruise revenues

​ 

there are remaining uncertainties about when our full fleet will be back in service at historical occupancy levels and accordingly we cannot estimate the impact on our business financial condition or near or longerterm financial or operational results with certainty however we expect to report a net loss until we are able to resume regular voyages as a result of omicron variantrelated impacts to operations in the first quarter of 2022 we now expect net cash provided by operating activities to be positive during the second quarter of 2022 refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further details regarding the significant impact the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on our financial condition and operations 

​ 

financing transactions and cost containment measures 

​ 

in 2021 and 2022 we continued to take actions to bolster our financial condition while our global cruise voyages are disrupted we have taken the following additional actions to enhance our liquidity profile and financial flexibility

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

refer to note 8 – “longterm debt” for further details about the above transactions

​ 

we undertook several proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the reduction of capital expenditures and deferral of debt amortization as well as a reduction in operating expenses including ship operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses cost savings initiatives to reduce selling general and administrative expenses which had already been implemented at the beginning of 2021 included the significant reduction or deferral of marketing expenditures the implementation of hiring freezes a 20 salary or hours reduction for certain shoreside team members a pause in our 401k matching contributions corporate travel freezes for shoreside employees and employee furloughs these cost

savings initiatives have now been discontinued as we resume cruise voyages

​ 

see “—liquidity and capital resources” below for more information

​ 

we have been experiencing some cost pressure in our supply chain due to inflation in an attempt to mitigate risks related to inflation our supply chain department has negotiated contracts with varying terms with a goal of providing us with the ability to take advantage of cost declines and diversified our sourcing options

​ 

executive overview 

the ongoing effects of covid19 on our operations and global bookings have had a significant adverse effect on our results of operations

total revenue decreased 494 to 06 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 capacity days decreased by 181

 year ended december 31 2021 “2021” compared to year ended december 31 2020 “2020” 

revenue 

total revenue decreased 494 to 06 billion in 2021 compared to 13 billion in 2020 the adverse impact on revenue was due to the suspension of all cruise voyages in march 2020 through the first half of 2021 and the phased relaunch of certain cruise voyages with ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels in the second half of 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in an 181 decrease in capacity days 

expense 

total cruise operating expense decreased 50 in 2021 compared to 2020 in 2021 our cruise operating expenses prior to the resumption of cruise voyages were primarily related to crew costs including salaries food and other travel costs fuel and other ongoing costs such as insurance and ship maintenance including drydock expenses the reduction in cruise operating expense in 2021 reflects lower direct costs such as commissions in the second half of 2021 due to fewer capacity days partially offset by increases in expenses related to our return to service such as costs related to crew and passenger testing for covid19 in 2020 our cruise operating expenses subsequent to the suspension of cruise voyages on march 13 2020 primarily included the cost of protected commissions and crew costs including salaries food and other repatriation costs fuel and other ongoing costs such as insurance and ship maintenance gross cruise cost increased 25 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily related to the change in costs described above offset by an increase in marketing general and administrative expenses primarily related to the discontinuation of costsaving initiatives described under “update regarding covid19 pandemic—financing transactions and cost containment measures” as we return to service total other operating expense decreased 482 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and trade names triggered by the covid19 pandemic in 2020 depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to a 255 million impairment loss recognized in 2020 

interest expense net was 21 billion in 2021 compared to 4823 million in 2020 the increase in 2021 primarily reflects losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 14 billion related to the repurchase of certain exchangeable notes as well as additional debt outstanding at higher interest rates partially offset by lower libor 2020 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 278 million

other income expense net was income of 1240 million in 2021 compared to expense of 336 million in 2020 other income in 2021 was primarily due to gains from derivatives not designated as hedges and foreign currency exchange other expense in 2020 was primarily due to losses from foreign currency exchange and fuel hedges recognized in earnings as a result of the forecasted transactions no longer being probable or no longer designated as hedges

income tax benefit expense was an expense of 53 million in 2021 compared to 125 million in 2020 in 2020 the tax expense is primarily due to a valuation allowance of 396 million recognized in the fourth quarter on certain net operating loss carryforwards partially offset by operating losses 

year ended december 31 2020 “2020” compared to year ended december 31 2019 “2019” 

revenue 

total revenue decreased 802 to 13 billion in 2020 compared to 65 billion in 2019 the adverse impact on revenue was due to the cancellation of the vast majority of sailings in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a 786 decrease in capacity days 

expense 

total cruise operating expense decreased 538 in 2020 compared to 2019 in 2020 our expenses subsequent to the suspension of voyages primarily included the cost of protected commissions and crew costs including salaries food and other repatriation costs fuel and other ongoing costs such as insurance and ship maintenance to repatriate crew as fast as possible the company leveraged certain ships in its fleet to assist with the repatriation efforts along with utilizing scheduled chartered flights additionally during the first quarter of 2020 there was a notable increase from 2019 in fuel expense associated with the international maritime organization’s 2020 regulations and cruise operating expense increased due to the addition of norwegian encore and seven seas splendor to the fleet gross cruise cost decreased 474 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in total cruise operating expense described above in addition to a 235 decrease in marketing general and administrative expenses primarily due to cost savings initiatives in connection with the covid19 pandemic as described under “update regarding covid19 pandemic—financing transactions and cost containment measures” total other operating expense increased 894 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and trade names triggered by the covid19 pandemic depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to the delivery of norwegian encore in the fourth quarter of 2019 and seven seas splendor in the first quarter of 2020 as well as ship improvement projects 

interest expense net was 4823 million in 2020 compared to 2729 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 is driven by additional debt outstanding at higher interest rates partially offset by lower libor in 2020 interest expense also reflects losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 278 million 2019 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 167 million

other income expense net was expense of 336 million in 2020 compared to income of 62 million in 2019 other expense in 2020 was primarily due to losses from foreign currency exchange and fuel hedges recognized in earnings as a result of the forecasted transactions no longer being probable or no longer designated as hedges other income in 2019 was primarily due to gains from insurance proceeds and a litigation settlement partially offset by losses on foreign currency exchange

income tax benefit expense was an expense of 125 million in 2020 compared to a benefit of 189 million in 2019 in 2020 the tax expense is primarily due to a valuation allowance of 396 million recognized in the fourth quarter on certain net operating loss carryforwards partially offset by operating losses during 2018 we implemented certain tax restructuring strategies that created our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of prestige for which we had previously provided a full valuation allowance as a result we recorded a tax benefit of 357 million in connection with the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance in 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

as of december 31 2021 our liquidity was 27 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a 1 billion commitment available through august 15 2022 our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service as of december 31 2021 we had a working capital deficit of 04 billion this deficit included 16 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our liquidity and undrawn exportcredit backed facilities  allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

during 2021 and 2022 the company completed various debt financings and equity offerings totaling 70 billion in gross proceeds of which 55 billion was used or will be used to extinguish debt and make principal payments maturing in the shortterm the nclh equity offerings in march and november 2021 resulted in 99436801 ordinary shares being issued which does not include any ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to our exchangeable notes see note 8 – “longterm debt” for further information

in january 2021 we amended our senior secured credit facility to further defer certain amortization payments due prior to june 30 2022 and to waive certain financial and other covenants through december 31 2022 in connection with such amendment our minimum liquidity requirement was increased to 200 million and such requirement applies through december 31 2022 in november 2021 the company further amended the senior secured credit facility to provide that among other things certain financial covenants shall be modified to provide that following the covenant relief period ending on december 31 2022 a free liquidity shall be required to be greater than or equal to 200000000 at any time b the ratio of total net funded debt to total capitalization shall be required to be not greater than 086 to 100 on march 31 2023 085 to 100 on june 30 2023 and 083 to 100 thereafter and c the ratio of ebitda to consolidated debt service shall be required to be greater than or equal to 125 to 100 unless free liquidity is greater than 200000000 this amendment also included changes to certain baskets providing the ability to make certain investments and incur debt

in addition in february 2021 we amended certain of our exportcredit backed facilities to defer amortization payments aggregating approximately 680 million through march 31 2022 we also amended all of our exportcredit backed facilities to provide that from the effective date of the amendments to and including december 31 2022 certain of the financial covenants under such facilities will be suspended and the free liquidity test will be replaced by a covenant to maintain at least 200 million in free liquidity the amendments also made certain other changes to the facilities including imposing further restrictions on nclc’s ability to incur debt create security issue equity and make dividends and other distributions additionally in december 2021 our exportcredit backed facilities were amended to provide for among other things the expiration of certain provisions upon repayment in full of certain amortization payments that are the subject of previous deferral arrangements and the modification of certain financial covenants to apply from january 1 2023 until september 30 2025 including the covenant to maintain at least 200 million in free liquidity which was previously imposed until december 31 2022 the amendments also made certain additional changes including the relaxation of certain restrictions on our ability to incur and repay or prepay debt create security and make dividends and other distributions

in july 2021 we amended nine credit facilities for our newbuild agreements and increased the combined commitments under such credit facilities by approximately 770 million to cover owner’s supply generally consisting of provisions for the ship modifications and financing premiums

in november 2021 the company executed a 1 billion commitment through august 15 2022 that provides additional liquidity to the company the company has not drawn and currently does not intend to draw under this commitment if drawn this commitment will convert into an unsecured note maturing in april 2024

the companys monthly average cash burn for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 345 million slightly below the prior estimate of approximately 350 million looking ahead the company expects the first quarter of 2022 monthly average cash burn to increase to approximately 390 million driven by the continued phased relaunch of additional vessels this cash burn rate does not include expected cash inflows from new and existing bookings or contribution from ships that have reentered service 

cash burn rates include ongoing ship operating expenses administrative operating expenses interest expense taxes debt deferral fees and expected nonnewbuild capital expenditures and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings newbuild related capital expenditures and other working capital changes future cash burn rate estimates also exclude unforeseen expenses the fourth quarter of 2021 cash burn rate and first quarter of 2022 estimate reflect the previously agreed to deferral of debt amortization and newbuild related payments

we continue to expect a gradual phased relaunch of our ships with our ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels as described in “update regarding covid19 pandemic” refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further details regarding the significant impact the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on our financial condition and operations the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties refer to note 2 – “summary of significant accounting policies” for further information on liquidity and management’s plan 

there can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the covid19 global pandemic based on the liquidity estimates and our current resources we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next 12 months nonetheless we anticipate that we will need additional equity andor debt financing to fund our operations in the future if we are unable to resume our cruise voyages on the schedule expected and particularly if a substantial portion of our fleet continues to have suspended cruise voyages or operate at significantly reduced occupancy levels for a prolonged period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations beyond 12 months we will pursue refinancings and other balance sheet optimization transactions from time to time in order to reduce interest rates and extend debt maturities we expect to collaborate with financing institutions regarding these refinancing and optimization transactions as opportunities arise in the shortterm to amend longterm arrangements

we have received certain financial and other debt covenant waivers and added new free liquidity requirements at december 31 2021 taking into account such waivers we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants if we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants we would have to seek to amend the covenants however no assurances can be made that such amendments would be approved by our lenders generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default andor cross acceleration clauses substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated which would have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity 

since march 2020 moody’s has downgraded our longterm issuer rating to b2 our senior secured rating to b1 and our senior unsecured rating to caa1 since april 2020 sp global has downgraded our issuer credit rating to b lowered our issuelevel rating on our 875 million revolving loan facility and 15 billion term loan a facility to bb our issuelevel rating on our other senior secured notes to b and our senior unsecured rating to b if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted we also have significant capacity to incur additional indebtedness under our debt agreements and may issue additional ordinary shares from time to time subject to our authorized number of ordinary shares however there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations 

as of december 31 2021 we had advance ticket sales of 18 billion including the longterm portion which included approximately 07 billion of future cruise credits we also have agreements with our credit card processors that as of december 31 2021 governed approximately 13 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the company relating to future voyages these agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances including the existence of a material adverse change excessive chargebacks and other triggering events that the company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral although the agreements vary these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased as of december 31 2021 we had cash collateral reserves of approximately 12 billion with credit card processors recognized in accounts receivable net or other longterm assets we may be required to pledge additional collateral andor post additional cash reserves or take other actions that may reduce our liquidity

future capital commitments 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts are 16 billion 25 billion and 14 billion for the years ending december 31 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively we have exportcredit backed financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 10 billion 20 billion and 07 billion for the years ending december 31 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively anticipated nonnewbuild capital expenditures are 05 billion for the year ended december 31 2022 which includes health and safety investments future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense

for the norwegian brand we have six prima class ships on order each ranging from approximately 140000 to 156300 gross tons with approximately 3215 to 3550 berths with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 for the regent brand we have one explorer class ship on order to be delivered in 2023 which will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

capitalized interest for the year ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was 436 million 252 million and 329 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

for other operational commitments for lease and port obligations we refer you to note 5 – “leases” and note 13 – “commitments and contingencies” respectively for further information

funding sources 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other ratios substantially all of our ships are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we have received certain financial and other debt covenant waivers through december 31 2022 and added new free liquidity requirements we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2021

in addition our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor pay dividends to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries 

for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

​ 

in light of the measures described under update regarding covid19 pandemic—financing transactions and cost containment measures we believe our cash on hand shortterm investments the undrawn 1 billion commitment the expected return of a portion of the cash collateral from our credit card processors expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12month period certain debt covenant waivers and modifications were received in 2021 to enable the company to maintain this compliance refer to “—liquidity and capital resources” for further information regarding the debt covenant waivers and liquidity requirements 

​ 

other 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these transactions were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities 

we refer you to “—liquidity and capital resources” for information regarding collateral provided to our credit card processors




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 we had an interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2021 72 of our debt was fixed and 28 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swap the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate derivative agreements was 02 billion as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2020 74 of our debt was fixed and 26 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps and collars the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate derivative agreements was 07 billion as of december 31 2020 the change in our fixed rate percentage from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 was primarily due to the maturity of interest rate swaps 

based on our december 31 2021 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 356 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €50 billion or 57 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2020 the payments not hedged aggregated €50 billion or 61 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2020 the change from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 included the addition of foreign currency hedges offset by the maturity of certain foreign currency hedges we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2021 would result in a 06 billion change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 188 for the year ended december 31 2021 and 156 for the year ended december 31 2020 we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2021 excluding fuel swaps for transactions that are no longer probable of occurrence we had hedged approximately 42 and 24 of our 2022 and 2023 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively as of december 31 2020 we had hedged approximately 37 and 15 of our 2022 and 2023 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively additional fuel swaps were executed between december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 to lower our fuel price risk

we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2022 fuel expense by 633 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 331 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

our company 

business overview 

we are a leading global cruise company which operates the norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises brands as of december 31 2020 we had 28 ships with approximately 59150 berths and had orders for nine additional ships to be delivered through 2027 due to covid19 we have temporarily suspended global cruise voyages through may 31 2021 we refer you to “—impact of covid19” for further information

our brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including europe asia australia new zealand south america africa canada bermuda caribbean alaska and hawaii norwegian’s usflagged ship pride of america provides the industry’s only entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii

all of our brands offer an assortment of features amenities and activities including a variety of accommodations multiple dining venues bars and lounges spa casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices all brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage

we have nine ships on order across our portfolio of brands for the norwegian brand project leonardo will introduce six additional ships with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 for regent seven seas cruises we have one explorer class ship on order for delivery in 2023 for oceania cruises we have two allura class ships on order for delivery in 2023 and 2025 these additions to our fleet will increase our total berths to approximately 83000 which includes additional berths we plan to add to our project leonardo ships subject to certain conditions the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged 

impact of covid19 

beginning on march 13 2020 nclh suspended all cruise voyages in response to covid19 this suspension has been extended through may 31 2021 the resumption of operations will be dependent in part on our ability to comply with various governmental regulations the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic the lifting of various travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries and communities around the world as well as port availability 

we expect a gradual phased relaunch of our ships after the voyage suspension period with our ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels our selection of itineraries in the shortterm will be predicated by port availability and the safety of the destinations we visit we continue to work with our partners at ports as well as governmental agencies to address the impact that covid19 will have on future operations including the ability to receive guests potential capacity restrictions and the need for physical distancing and other health guidelines that may be imposed on guests onboard the ship in port facilities and while in the destinations we visit our goal is to provide a safe and healthy cruise vacation while at the same time keeping the guest experience as authentic as possible

all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets and onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing however sales of cruises are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions as a result of covid19 there are severe negative impacts on consumer spending as well as our travel advisors’ operations and their ability to book cruises while booking volumes since the emergence of the covid19 global pandemic have remained below historical levels there continues to be demand for future cruise vacations despite reduced marketing investments refer to “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—update regarding covid19 pandemic” for additional information

​ 

strategy for covid19 

​ 

the company has taken several actions in response to the impact on our business brought on by the covid19 pandemic 

swift execution of financial action plan 

since march 2020 we launched a series of capital markets transactions to bolster our financial position during the voyage suspension period which in aggregate raised approximately 56 billion we have also taken several additional measures to improve our liquidity through deferring certain ship milestone payments deferring certain debt amortization payments and extending certain maturities under our debt agreements including under our agreements with export credit agencies “ecas” and related governments we have also undertaken several proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of covid19 through the reduction of capital expenditures as well as reductions in operating expenses including ship operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses refer to “ item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources ” for more detail regarding our covid19 financial action plan 

addressed significant operational challenges 

in response to the covid19 pandemic for the first time in the company’s history we implemented a voluntary suspension of global cruise voyages all passengers were disembarked from the 28 ships in the company’s fleet by march 28 2020

after our voluntary suspension of sailings we successfully completed the safe repatriation of our shipboard team members to their home countries around the globe we have repatriated shipboard team members to over 120 countries through a combination of chartered and commercial air flights as well as the use of certain of our ships in anticipation of a resumption of sailings following the conditional order and the amount of time expected to recruit train and transport crew we had begun the process of restaffing a limited number of our vessels however as a result of the resurgence of covid19 around the globe the continued lack of port availability and permission to sail in the destinations we normally serve along with other factors which make the timing of the resumption of cruise operations uncertain a portion of those crew members will be repatriated in the near term

roadmap to relaunch 

we have developed a comprehensive and multifaceted health and safety strategy to enhance our already rigorous protocols and address the unique public health challenges posed by covid19 in july 2020 we announced a collaboration with royal caribbean group to form a group of experts called the “healthy sail panel” to guide the 

industry in the development of new and enhanced cruise health and safety standards the panel is cochaired by dr scott gottlieb former commissioner of the us food and drug administration and governor mike leavitt former secretary of the us department of health and human services and consists of globally recognized experts from various disciplines including public health infectious disease biosecurity hospitality and maritime operations on september 21 2020 the expert panel published a report which included 74 detailed best practices across five key areas of focus to protect the public health and safety of guests crew and the communities where our cruise ships visit the panel also submitted its recommendations to the cdc in response to a cdc request for public comment to inform future public health guidance and preventative measures relating to travel on cruise ships the panel’s recommendations are informing new detailed health and safety protocols for our returntoservice plan the company continues to work with its expert advisors the healthy sail panel and global public health authorities and government agencies to refine its comprehensive and multilayered health and safety strategy to enhance its already rigorous health and safety standards in response to covid19

on october 30 2020 the cdc issued a conditional order that introduced a phased approach for the resumption of passenger cruises these phases include a the establishment of laboratory testing of crew onboard cruise ships in us waters b simulated voyages designed to test a cruise ship operator’s ability to mitigate covid19 on cruise ships c a certification process and d a return to passenger voyages in a manner that mitigates the risk of covid19 introduction transmission or spread among passenger and crew onboard ships and ashore to communities the conditional order replaced the cdc’s no sail order that expired on october 31 2020 and will remain in effect until the earlier of a the expiration of the secretary of health and human services’ declaration that covid19 constitutes a public health emergency b the cdc director’s rescission or modification of the conditional order based on specific public health or other considerations or c november 1 2021 additionally pursuant to the conditional order the cdc may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and the phases described above may be subject to change based on public health considerations including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ship operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of covid19 significant uncertainties remain regarding specific requirements of the conditional order including pending technical instructions from the cdc we continue to work through the requirements of the conditional order and work with the cdc and other federal agencies public health authorities and national and local governments in areas where we operate to take all necessary measures to protect our guests crew and the communities visited once operations resume we have begun the planning process to implement some of these recommendations including purchasing related equipment and supplies 

we expect a gradual phased relaunch of our ships after the voyage suspension period with our ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels the timing for returning our ships to service and the percentage of our fleet in service will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic including further resurgences and new variants of covid19 the availability distribution and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 our ability to comply with the conditional order port availability travel restrictions bans and advisories and our ability to restaff our ships and implement new enhanced health and safety protocols

for the norwegian brand project leonardo will introduce six additional ships each ranging from approximately 140000 to 156300 gross tons with approximately 3300 to 3550 berths with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 for the regent brand we have one explorer class ship on order to be delivered in 2023 which will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged

we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027 subject to certain conditions

competition 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival and royal caribbean as well as other cruise lines such as msc cruises crystal cruises viking ocean cruises and virgin voyages in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

ship maintenance and logistics 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel or twice in five years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed three years depending on flag state and age of vessel however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every five years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability we take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guestfacing services and innovative compliance technology

suppliers 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage advertising and marketing and travel advisor services most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition due to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

regulatory matters 

registration of our ships 

nineteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship eight of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

economic substance requirements 

nclh and nclc are exempted companies formed under the laws of bermuda and some of their subsidiaries have been formed in bermuda guernsey isle of man british virgin islands cayman islands or the bahamas in june 2018 the european union issued a scoping paper which set out economic substance requirements that targeted international financial centers including the jurisdictions listed above were required to adopt before 2019 with regard to relevant entities based in those jurisdictions pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws are required to demonstrate substantial economic substance in that jurisdiction in general terms substantial economic substance means i the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction ii core incomegenerating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction iii there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction iv the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction and v there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction we have evaluated the activities of nclh nclc and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases those activities are relevant activities for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that consequently certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements we may be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions if such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements we may be liable for penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions andor required to redomicile such entities to different jurisdictions 

environmental protection 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge wastewater management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various water and air qualityrelated requirements

with regard to air quality requirements the imo convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 various compliance methods such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized

marpol also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated emission control areas “ecas” which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel north american waters and the us caribbean sea ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods ecas have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen from newly built ships additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around norway japan and the mediterranean sea being considered

ballast water discharges are governed by the marpol ballast water management convention which came into force in 2017 “the convention” and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization may contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different or potentially unsuitable environments applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species

marpol also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage oil and sewage from ships including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage without causing delay to ships ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited unless they comply with resolution mepc 22764 adopted by the marine environmental protection committee “mepc” of the imo stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021

these requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” and the us coast guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federallyprotected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” program authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vesselspecific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

the act to prevent pollution from ships which implements certain elements of marpol in the us provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases the laws have no statutory limits of liability among the most stringent requirements are those set by the state of alaska which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

the european union “eu” has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the eu requires the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports as of january 1 2020 all noneca waters have a 05 fuel sulfur limit

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahamas ltd and ncl america llc are certified under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms and promote environmental awareness among our stakeholders both through our corporate global sustainability program sail  sustain and our annual stewardship report

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

permits for glacier bay alaska 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through september 30 2029 

passenger and crew wellbeing 

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the cdc and the fda we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

we refer you to “—strategy for covid19—roadmap to relaunch” for further information

security and safety 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

maritimelabor 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers as amended “stcw” establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

financial requirements 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 320 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments 

in addition our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the uk and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions as of december 31 2020 we have in place approximately £393 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £483 million the company has provided approximately 305 million in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required

compliance with these regulations has had an impact on our financial condition from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general we cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

taxation 

us income taxation 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” the nyse is considered to be an established securities market in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

for 2020 2019 and 2018 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to us federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 21 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

other united states taxation 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

uk income taxation 

nclh and nclc are tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for 

exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

changes in tax laws 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

as of december 31 2020 the composition of our workforce was as follows

 

compensation and benefits 

critical to our success is identifying recruiting retaining top talent and incentivizing existing and future team members we attract and retain talented team members by offering competitive compensation and benefits our payforperformance compensation philosophy for our shoreside team is based on rewarding each team member’s individual contributions we use a combination of fixed and variable pay components including base salary bonus equity commissions and merit increases we maintain a longterm incentive plan for our managerlevel team members and above that allows us to provide sharebased compensation to enhance our payforperformance culture and to support our attraction retention and motivational goals our compensation programs for our shipboard team are similarly competitive and for the majority of this team negotiated with various unions and documented in collective bargaining agreements 

the success of our company is connected to the wellbeing of our team members such that we offer a competitive benefits package including physical financial and emotional wellbeing benefits we offer our fulltime us shoreside team members a choice of companysubsidized medical and dental programs to meet their needs and those of their families in addition we offer health savings and flexible spending accounts vision cover paid time off employee assistance programs short term disability and voluntary longterm disability insurance term life and business travel insurance additionally we offer a 401k retirement savings plan education assistance including tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we repatriated our nonessential crew members and transitioned our shoreside team to a remote work environment which currently remains in place our crew repatriation was carried out as quickly as possible given constraints presented by travel restrictions regulatory requirements and other challenges we utilized air charters and commercial flights as well as certain of our own vessels to transport crew home during this time our crew were compensated according to their respective collective bargaining agreements and were provided wifi medical care accommodations and a daily onboard stipend when in stand down status after the conclusion of their contract they had continual access to medical professionals to support their physical and mental wellbeing the company also funded housing expenses if quarantine was required upon arrival while crew members are at home the company maintains regular contact and provides business updates on our company as well as the state of the industry to keep them informed

due to the global suspension of our cruise voyages since march 13 2020 we took certain actions to preserve liquidity we reduced our salary and benefit expense to a level more commensurate with our operations by reducing salaries and hours worked by 20 across the board during 2020 furloughing certain shoreside team members and generally not backfilling vacated positions the furlough program was chosen over a reduction in force as it facilitated retention of our valued team members while we await a return to sailing consistent with our familycentric culture we continued the 

employer subsidy for medical cover for our furloughed team members and in addition funded the team member’s portion for our furloughed team and their dependents we also participated in short time compensation programs in florida and arizona to support our team members on 20 reduced hours to receive benefits from their state unemployment offices our shoreside offices monitor and follow government legislation and guidance and are prepared to return to our office environments when it is deemed safe to do so for the protection of our shipboard team members guests and communities we visit our healthy sail panel has developed a comprehensive and multifaceted health and safety strategy to enhance our already rigorous protocols and address the unique public health challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic 

training and development 

the opportunity to grow and develop skills and experience regardless of job role division or geographic location is critical to the success of the company as a global organization we actively foster a culture of learning and offer a variety of developmental courses for our team members we provide a mentorship program where even our most senior leaders actively participate succession planning is part of our culture we have a yearround focus on providing team members with opportunities to develop their leadership skills and add to our bench of talent through various training initiatives succession planning and talent review programs allow us to continuously calibrate and evaluate high potential talent offering talent rotations and investing in development for longterm success 

shipboard team members have the opportunity to learn the skills and responsibilities of another position in a different department either to increase their effectiveness in the company or to give them the opportunity to shift their career path 

retention and engagement 

we have a history of strong retention rates across our shoreside and shipboard teams which we attribute to our culture that allows our team members to thrive and achieve their career goals our voluntary retention rate throughout 2020 remained at historical levels despite the impact that the covid19 pandemic has had on our company and industry we implemented a standby pay program in 2020 to retain our key shipboard officers who are off their normal contract rotation which will facilitate our return to service with our experienced team 

exceptional team members are recognized by a robust annual award of excellence recognition program which acknowledges and rewards individual team members and teams for their demonstration of company values we recently developed the kloster visionary award which honors the company’s founder knut kloster by recognizing a team member whose spirit of innovation follows in the footsteps of this visionary through the shipboard vacation hero awards program shipboard supervisors and management recognize select shipboard team members that have proven to be outstanding in selected categories this award program is designed to provide recognition and promote total guest satisfaction by encouraging and rewarding team members for demonstrating excellence in service teamwork attitude and leadership

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business if any of the risks discussed or additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the covid19 pandemic has also had the effect of heightening many of the risks described below the ordering of the risk factors below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

​ 

covid19 and debtliquidity related risk factors 

​ 

covid19 has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial condition and operations the current and uncertain future impact of the covid19 pandemic including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel including on cruises is expected to continue to impact our results operations outlook plans goals growth reputation cash flows liquidity demand for voyages and share price 

​ 

the spread of covid19 and the developments surrounding the global pandemic are having significant negative impacts on all aspects of our business in march 2020 we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands which has subsequently been extended through may 31 2021 we are currently expecting a gradual phased relaunch of cruise voyages in the future but due to the uncertainties surrounding the covid19 pandemic the suspension may be extended again or could potentially be reinstated after we have begun sailing and the total length of the suspension may be prolonged in addition we have been and will continue to be further negatively impacted by related developments including heightened governmental regulations and travel advisories including recommendations and orders by the us department of state the cdc and the department of homeland security and travel bans and restrictions each of which has impacted and is expected to continue to significantly impact global guest sourcing and our access to various ports of call around the globe on october 30 2020 the cdc issued a conditional order that introduces a phased approach for the resumption of passenger cruises we continue to work through the requirements of the conditional order but as currently drafted it is unclear whether we will be able to comply with the conditional order and the timing for our ability to resume cruises is therefore uncertain additionally compliance with the conditional order may involve significant costs and could create significant uncertainties about our ability to continue to operate our cruise voyages once sailing resumes we will continue to incur covid19 related costs as we implement additional healthrelated protocols on our ships such as physical distancing measures which may have a significant effect on our operations in addition the industry will be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet there is no guarantee that the health and safety protocols we implement will be successful in preventing the spread of covid19 onboard our ships and among our passengers and crew

​ 

to date the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant costs and lost revenue as a result of the suspension of cruise voyages reduced demand for cruise vacations guest compensation itinerary modifications redeployments and cancellations travel restrictions and advisories the unavailability of ports andor destinations costs to return our passengers to their home destinations and expenses to transport our crew to and from our ships and to assist some of our crew that have been unable to return home in an optimal time frame with food and housing

​ 

we have actively worked to disembark our crew members who will not remain with our ships through the suspension and transport them safely to their home countries but our ability to transport crew to and from our ships in the future is dependent on a number of factors including the ability to transport crew members to and from their home countries due to the limited number of commercial flights and charter options available and governmental restrictions and regulations with respect to disembarking crew members and travel generally such restrictions on crew travel could impact our ability to restaff our ships once operations resume

​ 

between march 12 2020 and april 30 2020 three class action lawsuits were filed against us under sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder alleging that we made false and misleading statements to the market and customers about covid19 in addition in march 2020 the florida attorney general announced an investigation related to our marketing during the covid19 pandemic following the announcement of the investigation by the florida attorney general we received notifications from other attorneys general and governmental agencies that they are conducting similar investigations we may be the subject of additional lawsuits and investigations stemming from covid19 we cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material

​ 

we have nine newbuilds on order scheduled to be delivered through 2027 the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged

​ 

due to the unknown duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic travel restrictions bans and advisories uncertainties around our ability to comply with the conditional order the potential unavailability of ports andor destinations unknown cancellations and timing of redeployments and a general impact on consumer sentiment regarding cruise travel there are continuing uncertainties about when our full fleet will be back in service at historical occupancy levels even if we are able to relaunch cruise voyages moreover even after we relaunch our cruise voyages demand for 

cruises may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if and when each brand will return to prepandemic demand or pricing levels due to the discretionary nature of leisure travel spending and the competitive nature of the cruise industry our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the us economy and economies in other regions of the world unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted and may result in the future in decreased demand for cruise vacations changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors all of which in turn have had and may continue to have in the future a strong negative effect on our business in particular our bookings may be negatively impacted by enhanced health and safety protocols including potential vaccination requirements concerns that cruises are susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases as well as adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate including higher unemployment rates declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of covid19 the ongoing covid19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels are expected to have a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and in turn is expected to depress demand for cruise vacations into the foreseeable future due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of this pandemic we can provide no assurance as to when and at what pace demand for cruise vacations will return to prepandemic levels if at all accordingly we cannot predict the full impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we cannot predict the impact covid19 will have on our partners such as travel agencies suppliers and other vendors we may be adversely impacted by any adverse impact our partners suffer

​ 

as a result of these unprecedented circumstances we are not able to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our company in particular we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and our cash flows required for cash refunds of fares for cancelled sailings as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the public’s concern regarding the health and safety of travel including by cruise ship and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising depending on the length of the suspension and number of cancellations we may be required to provide cash refunds for a substantial portion of the balance of our advanced ticket sales

​ 

moreover our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends in part upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public’s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally as well as regarding the cruise industry and our ships actual or perceived risk of infection could have an adverse effect on the public’s perception of the company which could harm our reputation and business

​ 

as a result of the impacts of covid19 provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements have and may continue to adversely affect our liquidity we have agreements with several credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and provide other services under these agreements the credit card companies could under certain circumstances and upon written notice require us to maintain a reserve which reserve would be funded by the credit card companies withholding or offsetting our credit card receivables or our posting of cash or other collateral as a result of the impacts of covid19 we have seen an increase in demand from consumers for refunds on their tickets and we anticipate this will continue to be the case for the near future as of december 31 2020 we had a reserve of approximately 200 million with a credit card processor recognized in other longterm assets and in january 2021 we provided additional cash collateral of 250 million additionally we are required to fund all refunds until further notice and 100 of incoming advance ticket sales deposits with this credit card processor will be withheld and are not expected to be released until the credit card processor’s exposure is fully collateralized as of december 31 2020 the exposure was approximately 780 million the reserve shortfall of approximately 330 million after taking into effect the january additional collateral provided will decrease as refunds are funded cruises are provided and amounts withheld by the credit card processor are allocated to the reserve rather than remitted to the company we may be required to find new credit card processors pledge additional collateral andor post cash reserves or take other actions that may further reduce our liquidity as a consequence our financial position and liquidity could be further materially impacted

​ 

as a result of all of the foregoing we will report a net loss for the three months ending march 31 2021 and expect to report a net loss until we are able to resume voyages our ability to forecast our cash inflows and additional capital needs is hampered and we could be required to raise additional capital in the future our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing the terms and conditions of our existing debt agreements and any agreements governing future indebtedness our prospects and our credit ratings since march 2020 moody’s has downgraded our longterm issuer rating to b2 our senior secured rating to b1 and our senior unsecured rating to caa1 since april 2020 

sp global has downgraded our issuer credit rating to b lowered our issuelevel rating on our 875 million revolving loan facility and 15 billion term loan a facility to bb our issuelevel rating on our 675 million 2024 senior secured notes and 750 million 2026 senior secured notes to bb and our senior unsecured rating to b we anticipate that sp global will further downgrade our issuer credit rating to b and lower our senior unsecured rating to b or ccc if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations

​ 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs the terms of any instruments governing future indebtedness may also require us to provide incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations

​ 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty the current pandemic and continued spread of covid19 has caused a global recession which could have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations and this impact could exist for an extended period of time

​ 

the extent of the effects of the pandemic on our business and the cruise industry at large is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments many of which are outside of our control including but not limited to the duration spread severity and any recurrence of the pandemic the severity and transmission rates of new variants of covid19 the availability distribution and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 the duration and scope of related federal state and local government orders and restrictions the extent of the impact of covid19 on overall demand for cruise vacations and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and normal economic and operating conditions to resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted covid19 has also had the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein such as those relating to our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness

​ 

additionally epidemics pandemics and viral outbreaks or other wideranging health scares in the future would likely also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have paused our global fleet cruise operations and if we are unable to recommence normal operations we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities 

​ 

certain of our debt facilities include maintenance and financial covenants for example under the senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain a loan to value ratio of no less than 070 to 100 financial covenants include free liquidity of no less than 50000000 at all times a total net funded debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 070 to 100 at the end of each quarter and either free liquidity of no less than 100000000 or ebitda to consolidated debt service ratio of at least 125 to 100 at the end of each fiscal quarter as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have paused our global fleet cruise operations and if we are unable to recommence normal operations we may be out of compliance with some or all of the maintenance and financial covenants in certain of our debt facilities if we expect to not be in compliance we would expect to seek waivers from the lenders under these facilities or renegotiate these facilities prior to any covenant violation for example on january 29 2021 we entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility which provides that from the amendment effective date to and including december 31 2022 the testing of the covenants under the senior secured credit facility will be suspended and the free liquidity test will be replaced by a covenant to maintain at least 200000000 in free liquidity certified on a monthly basis this amendment 

also made certain other changes to the senior secured credit facility including tightening certain of the baskets applicable to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and make asset dispositions investments and restricted payments

any covenant waiver or renegotiation of any of our debt facilities has led and may in the future lead to increased costs increased interest rates additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under these debt facilities and such increased costs restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities will be limited by the restrictions in our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers or renegotiate these facilities in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all if we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities we would be in default of such agreements which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements as a consequence we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities if we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital or divest assets to refinance or repay such facility or facilities

​ 

with respect to each of these debt facilities if we were unable to or did not obtain a waiver renegotiate or refinance or repay such debt facilities it would lead to an event of default under such facilities which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities in turn this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which includes a significant portion of our assets including our ships any such action would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations as a result the failure to obtain the covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations

​ 

we anticipate that we will need additional financing in the future which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

​ 

we anticipate that we will need additional equity andor debt financing to fund our operations in the future especially if our suspension of cruise voyages is prolonged we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all depending on market and other conditions the ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control including general economic and market conditions the health of financial institutions our credit ratings and investors’ and lenders’ assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the cruise industry in general all of which may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic nclh anticipates seeking shareholder approval to increase its authorized share capital at a future shareholder meeting so that it can raise additional equity capital such increase may not be approved if we raise additional funds through equity or debt issuances our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities could have rights preferences and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our ordinary shares if and when holders of our exchangeable notes exchange their exchangeable notes for ordinary shares nclh’s shareholders will be significantly diluted if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements and we may be required to further encumber our assets we may not have sufficient available collateral to pledge to support additional financing if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms or at all we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures which could negatively affect our business our credit ratings which have been downgraded as a result of the impact on our business of the covid19 pandemic could be further downgraded which could have an impact on the availability or cost of financing in addition we may conclude that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern which could have additional effects on our credit ratings and the availability or cost of financing there can be no assurance that our ability to access the credit or capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy if we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows andor borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets our business and financial condition could be adversely affected and it may be necessary for us to reorganize our company in its entirety including through bankruptcy proceedings and our shareholders may lose their investment in our ordinary shares

​ 

our indebtedness and the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a substantial majority of our assets are collateral under our debt agreements 

​ 

a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy and the industry in which we operate we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness which may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

​ 

in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay dividends or make distributions to nclh repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

​ 

any further impairment of our trade names or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

​ 

we evaluate trade names and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable several factors including a challenging operating environment impacts affecting consumer demand or spending the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations for example we suspended our cruise voyages in march 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic which substantially impacted our cash flows reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s trade name or goodwill during the three months ended march 31 2020 we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of 13 billion see note 4 —“goodwill and intangible assets” for additional information as of december 31 2020 there was 981 million of goodwill for the regent seven seas reporting unit after impairment we also recognized an impairment loss for our oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises trade names during the year ended december 31 2020 in an aggregate amount of 3170 million with 5005 million remaining as of december 31 2020 we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments however a change in our estimated future operating cash flows may result in a decline in fair value in future periods which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges 

​ 

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

​ 

economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

​ 

certain of our debt agreements use libor as a reference rate for interest rate calculations in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is intended to replace us dollar libor plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced at this time we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our results of operations in addition some of our debt agreements which use libor as a reference rate do not contain fallback reference rates if libor is discontinued we may incur additional costs related to contract renegotiation for such agreements

​ 

operational related risk factors 

​ 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to health safety and environmental concerns existing capacity constraints security adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes floods typhoons and earthquakes financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies the covid19 pandemic has substantially limited the number of ports that are able and willing to accommodate passenger cruise voyages and we cannot be sure how long these limitations will continue in the past regulatory changes have prohibited us from visiting ports in destinations like cuba and we have temporarily changed certain itineraries in the caribbean due to damage some ports sustained from hurricanes there can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future due to environmental and overcrowding concerns some local governments have begun to take measures to limit the number of cruise ships and passengers allowed at certain destinations for example dubrovnik venice and barcelona have either implemented or considered implementing such limitations on cruise ships and passengers limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports have adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations in the past and could do so in the future

​ 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

​ 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of health and safety events strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example many commercial airlines have reduced services due to the covid19 pandemic covid19 related regulations have also prevented us from using commercial airline services to transport many of our crew members to and from our ships which has resulted in increased costs to our company

​ 

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

​ 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

​ 

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes floods and typhoons fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs and the frequency and severity of natural disasters may increase due to climate change the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships in the past and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us the expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor increased expenditures

​ 

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

​ 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade trade disputes and increased tariffs could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

​ 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations subject us to significant fines penalties and damages and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and disruptions to these systems or networks could impair our operations have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty 

technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters information systems failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks our business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security may not prevent disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

​ 

as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information the security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business we experience cyberattacks of varying degrees on our systems and networks and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyberattacks can include to computer viruses malware worms hackers and other malicious software programs or other attacks including physical and electronic breakins router disruption sabotage or espionage disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denialofservice attacks for example in october 2018 we discovered limited instances of unauthorized access to certain employee email communications some of which contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information we have implemented additional safeguards and we do not believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident however there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in addition we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches unauthorized access or other cyberattacks or incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents our failure to successfully prevent mitigate or timely respond to such incidents could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation

​ 

we are also subject to laws in multiple jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data noncompliance with these laws or the compromise of information systems used by us or our service providers resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests employees or vendors could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment the regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another

​ 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems or a cyberattack or other cyber incident we may incur costs associated with the following response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement data restoration regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees damages and settlements in addition data security breaches a cyberattack or other cyber incident may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data loss of company assets damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

​ 

changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices 

​ 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations for example as of january 2020 the imo’s convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships marpol set a 

global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the previous 35 global limit various compliance methods such as the use of lowsulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized we have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet which will allow us to continue to use highsulfur fuel on those ships in certain areas however if exhaust gas cleaning systems are not widely used in the industry low demand for highsulfur fuel may increase the price for such fuel ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning systems and in specified areas even ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems will be required to use lowsulfur fuels lowsulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

​ 

mechanical malfunctions and repairs delays in our shipbuilding program maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair for example in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

​ 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business currently the impacts of covid19 on the shipyards where our ships are under construction or will be constructed have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries and the impacts of covid19 could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future which may be prolonged the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

​ 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

​ 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

​ 

we have operations in and source passengers from the uk and member countries of the eu and nclh and nclc are tax residents of the uk the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the uk and the eu ended on december 31 2020 in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that will apply provisionally after the end of the transition period until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement on december 31 2020 the uk passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement with the eu expected to formally adopt the agreement in early 2021 the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu including as it relates to trade transport visas judicial law enforcement and security matters and provides for continued participation in community programs and mechanisms for dispute resolution although we have an international customer base we could be adversely affected by greater currency and economic volatility in the uk brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

​ 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

​ 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

​ 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

​ 

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

​ 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add nine additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations additionally older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices

​ 

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

​ 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets in the future such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

there can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we or other members of our protection and indemnity associations were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected for example in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

​ 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

​ 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

​ 

the us government announced that effective may 2 2019 it will no longer suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of 1996 popularly known as the helmsburton act allowing certain individuals whose property was confiscated by the cuban government beginning in 1959 to sue anyone who traffics in the property in question in us courts a claim against us is pending and additional claims may be brought against us in the future if these suits are successful they could result in substantial monetary damages against the company lawsuits and investigations stemming from covid19 have also been brought against us and we may be subject to additional lawsuits and investigations related to covid19 in the future we cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results but any such impact may be material

​ 

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business currently we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain crew members any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

​ 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

​ 

the impacts of and uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic may make it more difficult to retain crew members to restaff our fleet once we resume operations and to recruit new employees generally

​ 

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

​ 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

​ 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

​ 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

​ 

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

​ 

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

​ 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

​ 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex 

stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business—taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

​ 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

​ 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

​ 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

​ 

increasingly stringent and complex international federal state and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union individual countries the united states and individual states have implemented and are considering new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol imo’s requirements governing environmental protection and stcw an imo regulation governing ship manning in the united states the environmental protection agency and the us coast guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations

​ 

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels requiring the use of shore power while in port increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations

​ 

the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and 

many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands and waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems

​ 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact

​ 

in the past states have implemented taxes that impact the cruise industry it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

​ 

our ability to comply with economic substance requirements in certain jurisdictions and increased costs and efforts associated with our efforts to comply may have a negative impact on our operations 

​ 

our company and certain of its subsidiaries may be subject to economic substance requirements in their jurisdictions of formation including bermuda guernsey isle of man british virgin islands cayman islands and the bahamas pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws are required to demonstrate substantial economic substance in that jurisdiction in general terms substantial economic substance means i the entity is actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction ii core incomegenerating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity are performed in the jurisdiction iii there are adequate employees in the jurisdiction iv the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction and v there is adequate operating expenditure in the jurisdiction we have evaluated the activities of nclh nclc and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases those activities are relevant activities for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that consequently certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements we may be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions if such entities cannot establish compliance with these requirements we may be liable to penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions andor required to redomicile such entities to different jurisdictions that may have tax regimes and other regulatory regimes which may be less favorable

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

​ 

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 

​ 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

​ 

nclh does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

​ 

nclh does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the 

discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

​ 

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

​ 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests for instance these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include i the ability of nclh’s board of directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval ii a classified board of directors iii the sole power of a majority of nclh’s board of directors to fix the number of directors iv the power of nclh’s board of directors to fill any vacancy on nclh’s board of directors in most circumstances including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise and v advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings

​ 

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial presentation 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report see also “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” immediately prior to part i item 1 in this annual report 

we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months however our cruise voyages were completely suspended during the last nine months of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and such suspension has been extended through may 31 2021 passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment port fees and taxes and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services and photo services our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated 

financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to liquidity ship accounting and asset impairment

liquidity 

we make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our liquidity 

significant events affecting travel including covid19 typically have an impact on demand for cruise vacations with the full extent of the impact generally determined by the length of time the event influences travel decisions we believe the ongoing effects of covid19 on our operations and global bookings have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our financial results and liquidity and such negative impact may continue beyond the containment of the pandemic 

the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties upon the relaunch of cruise voyages our principal assumptions for future cash flow projections include

 

due to the unknown duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic travel restrictions bans and advisories uncertainties around our ability to comply with governmental regulations the potential unavailability of ports andor destinations voyage cancellations and timing of redeployments and a general impact on consumer sentiment regarding cruise travel we cannot predict when we will relaunch voyages or when our full fleet will be back in service at historical occupancy levels until we are able to begin our phased relaunch our projected liquidity requirements reflect our principal assumptions surrounding ongoing operating costs during the suspension of cruise voyages as well as liquidity requirements for financing costs and necessary capital expenditures and our ability to implement further cash conservation strategies including but not limited to

 

we cannot make assurances that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements may not change because we have never experienced a complete cessation of our cruise voyages accordingly the full effect of our suspension of cruise voyages on our financial performance and financial condition cannot be quantified at this time we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of covid19 within our financial statements and there may be material changes to those estimates in future periods the company has taken and will continue to take proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of covid19 through the reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses deferral of ship milestone payments amendments of debt agreements and capital market transactions 

​ 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship when we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship’s cost basis we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship’s cost basis repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

we determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull the useful lives of ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components in addition to determine the useful lives of the ship or ship components we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets manufacturer recommended lives and anticipated changes in technological conditions given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher in 2020 one ship had significant improvements that extended the remaining weighted average useful life of the vessel accordingly we have updated our estimate of both its useful life and residual value based on the new weighted average useful life of its current components the impact of the change in estimate is accounted on a prospective basis and is not material

if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated weighted average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2020 would have increased by 198 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 996 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

asset impairment 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for ship impairment analyses the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities is each individual ship we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates judgments and projections as necessary our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk

we evaluate goodwill and trade names for impairment on december 31 or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value for trade names we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment

in order to make this evaluation we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist

 

we also may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step 1 test which uses discounted future cash flows and other market data to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units our discounted cash flow valuation reflects our principal assumptions of 1 forecasted future operating results and growth rates which have been prepared under multiple scenarios and are probability weighted 2 forecasted capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements and 3 a weighted average cost of capital of market participants historically our step 1 test consisted of a combined approach using discounted future cash flows and market multiples to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units however beginning with the step 1 test performed as of march 31 2020 as a result of triggering events the market multiples were used solely as a corroboratory approach given the impact of covid19 on the current year’s results as of the valuation date as well as prospective results including the lack of any guidance provided which were not available for our peers we concluded that this approach is the most representative method to estimate fair value as it utilizes expectations of longterm growth as well as current market conditions for the trade names we use the relief from royalty method which uses the same forecasts and discount rates from the discounted cash flow valuation in the goodwill assessment along with a trade name royalty rate assumption

​ 

we have concluded that our business has three reporting units each brand oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of 13 billion based on the impairment test performed as of march 31 2020 see note 4 – “goodwill and intangible assets” for additional information as of december 31 2020 there was 981 million of goodwill remaining for the regent seven seas reporting unit we also recognized an impairment loss for our oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises trade names in an aggregate amount of 3170 million based on the march 31 2020 impairment test with 5005 million remaining as of december 31 2020 for our 2020 annual goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations we elected to perform quantitative testing based on the results of the step 1 tests at december 31 2020 we determined there was no further impairment of goodwill because the estimated fair value of the regent seven seas reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value we also determined there was no impairment to our trade names we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments however a change in our estimated future operating cash flows may result in a decline in estimated fair value in future periods which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these and other nongaap financial measures we utilize net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to manage our business on a daytoday basis in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance as a result of our voluntary suspension of sailings during the last nine months of 2020 we did not have any capacity days in those periods accordingly we have not presented herein per capacity day data for the year ended december 31 2020

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

in addition adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred 306 million related to the redeployment of norwegian joy from asia to the us we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since the expenses are not representative of our daytoday operations however this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within this form 10k

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

update regarding covid19 pandemic 

​ 

suspension of cruise voyages 

​ 

due to the continued spread of covid19 evolving travel restrictions and limited access to ports around the world in march 2020 we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands which has subsequently been extended through may 31 2021 this is the first time we have completely suspended our cruise voyages and as a result of these unprecedented circumstances we are not able to predict the full impact of such a suspension on our company the duration of any voluntary suspensions we have implemented and the resumption of operations both inside and outside of the united states will be dependent in part on our ability to comply with the conditional order the severity and duration of the covid19 global pandemic including further resurgences and new variants of covid19 the availability distribution and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 the lifting of various travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries and communities around the world as well as the availability of ports for more information on the impact of covid19 on our business see “impact of covid19” and “strategy for covid19” in part i item 1business in this annual report on form 10k

​ 

modified policies 

​ 

our brands have launched new cancellation policies for certain sailings booked during certain time periods to permit our guests to cancel cruises which were not part of our temporary suspension of voyages up to 15 days prior to embarkation and receive a refund in the form of a credit to be applied toward a future cruise the future cruise credits issued under these programs are valid for any sailing through december 31 2022 and we may extend the length of time these future cruise credits may be redeemed the use of such credits may prevent us from garnering certain future cash collections as staterooms booked by guests with such credits will not be available for sale resulting in less cash collected from bookings to new guests we may incur incremental commission expense for the use of these future cruise credits in addition to provide more flexibility to our guests we have also extended our modified final payment schedule for all voyages on regent seven seas cruises through july 31 2021 and for voyages on oceania cruises and for the majority of bookings for voyages on norwegian cruise line through october 31 2021 which now requires payment 60 days prior to embarkation versus the standard 120 days our brands currently expect to provide cash refunds for cash bookings for future sailings we may cancel

​ 

update on bookings 

​ 

while overall booking volumes since the emergence of the covid19 global pandemic remain below historical levels there continues to be demand for future cruise vacations despite reduced sales and marketing investments and a travel agency industry that has not been at full strength for months bookings have been strong for future periods resulting in an elongated booking window as guests book further into the future the company’s overall cumulative booked position for the second half of 2021 remains below historical levels driven by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of limited marketing investments to 2022 sailings pricing for the second half of 2021 is in line with prepandemic levels even after including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits while still early in the booking cycle 2022 booking trends are very positive driven by strong pent up demand the overall cumulative booked position for the first half of 2022 is significantly ahead of 2019’s record levels with pricing in line when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits and down including the dilutive future cruise credits our operations may be suspended beyond our announced suspensions and as a result current booking data may not be informative in addition because of our updated cancellation policies bookings may not be representative of actual cruise revenues

​ 

the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and global bookings have had and we believe they will continue to have a significant impact on our financial results and liquidity and such negative impact may continue well beyond the containment of the pandemic significant events affecting travel including covid19 typically have an impact on the demand for cruise vacations with the full extent of the impact generally determined by the length of time the event influences travel decisions due to the unknown duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic uncertainty surrounding the availability of covid19 vaccines and therapeutics travel restrictions and advisories uncertainties around our ability to comply with the conditional order the potential unavailability of ports andor 

destinations unknown cancellations and timing of redeployments and a general impact on consumer sentiment regarding cruise travel there are remaining uncertainties about when our full fleet will be back in service at historical occupancy levels and accordingly we cannot estimate the impact on our business financial condition or near or longerterm financial or operational results with certainty however we will report a net loss for the quarter ending march 31 2021 and expect to report a net loss until we are able to resume voyages 

​ 

financing transactions and cost containment measures 

in march 2020 nclc borrowed the full amount of 155 billion under its existing 875 million revolving loan facility and its then existing 675 million epic credit facility since march 2020 we have taken several actions to bolster our financial position while our global cruise voyages are currently suspended including a series of debt and equity financing transactions completed in may july november and december 2020 in may 2020 nclh and nclc launched a series of capital markets transactions and raised approximately 24 billion including the full exercise of options to purchase additional ordinary shares and exchangeable notes in july 2020 nclh and nclc launched a series of capital markets transactions and raised approximately 15 billion including the full exercise of the option to purchase additional ordinary shares and partial exercise of the option to purchase additional exchangeable notes from the proceeds approximately 675 million was used to repay the epic credit facility which was terminated in july 2020 in november 2020 nclh launched an offering of ordinary shares and raised 824 million in december 2020 nclc launched an offering of its 5875 senior notes due 2026 the “2026 senior unsecured notes” and raised approximately 850 million

we have also undertaken several proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of the covid19 pandemic through the reduction of capital expenditures as well as a reduction in operating expenses including ship operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses cost savings initiatives to reduce selling general and administrative expenses already implemented include the significant reduction or deferral of marketing expenditures the implementation of hiring freezes a 20 salary or hours reduction for certain shoreside team members a pause in our 401k matching contributions and corporate travel freezes for shoreside employees we have returned certain shoreside team members to full salary and hours and expect to continue to do so over time as we prepare to resume cruise voyages further as part of our ongoing strategy to improve our ability to sustain the longterm health of the business and to preserve financial flexibility during the covid19 crisis we have furloughed certain shoreside employees subject to change based on business needs while on furlough employees will not receive salary or hourly wages but will continue to receive health benefit coverage if they currently participate in a companysponsored plan

 year ended december 31 2020 “2020” compared to year ended december 31 2019 “2019” 

revenue 

total revenue decreased 802 to 13 billion in 2020 compared to 65 billion in 2019 the adverse impact on revenue was due to the cancellation of the vast majority of sailings in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a 786 decrease in capacity days 

expense 

total cruise operating expense decreased 538 in 2020 compared to 2019 in 2020 our expenses subsequent to the suspension of voyages primarily included the cost of protected commissions and crew costs including salaries food and other repatriation costs fuel and other ongoing costs such as insurance and ship maintenance to repatriate crew as fast as possible the company leveraged certain ships in its fleet to assist with the repatriation efforts along with utilizing scheduled chartered flights additionally during the first quarter of 2020 there was a notable increase from 2019 in fuel expense associated with the international maritime organization’s 2020 regulations and cruise operating expense increased due to the addition of norwegian encore and seven seas splendor to the fleet gross cruise cost decreased 474 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in total cruise operating expense described above in addition to a 235 decrease in marketing general and administrative expenses primarily due to cost savings initiatives in connection with the covid19 pandemic as described under “update regarding covid19 pandemic—financing transactions and cost containment measures” total other operating expense increased 894 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and trade names triggered by the covid19 pandemic depreciation and amortization expense also increased primarily due to the delivery of norwegian encore in the fourth quarter of 2019 and seven seas splendor in the first quarter of 2020 as well as ship improvement projects 

interest expense net was 4823 million in 2020 compared to 2729 million in 2019 the increase in 2020 is driven by additional debt outstanding at higher interest rates partially offset by lower libor in 2020 interest expense also reflects losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 278 million 2019 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 167 million

other income expense net was expense of 336 million in 2020 compared to income of 62 million in 2019 other expense in 2020 was primarily due to losses from foreign currency exchange and fuel hedges recognized in earnings as a result of the forecasted transactions no longer being probable or no longer designated as hedges other income in 2019 was primarily due to gains from insurance proceeds and a litigation settlement partially offset by losses on foreign currency exchange

income tax benefit expense was an expense of 125 million in 2020 compared to a benefit of 189 million in 2019 in 2020 the tax expense is primarily due to a valuation allowance of 396 million recognized in the fourth quarter on certain net operating loss carryforwards partially offset by operating losses during 2018 we implemented certain tax restructuring strategies that created our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of prestige for which we had previously provided a full valuation allowance as a result we recorded a tax benefit of 357 million in connection with the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance in 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

as of december 31 2020 our liquidity was 33 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and our working capital was 16 billion the increase in working capital is a result of the actions described below and is expected to decrease as advance ticket sales increase leading up to when we are able to resume voyages

since march 2020 we have taken several actions to bolster our financial condition while our global cruise voyages are suspended in march 2020 nclc borrowed the full amount of 155 billion under its 875 million revolving loan facility and its then existing 675 million epic credit facility the epic credit facility was repaid in july 2020 through december 31 2020 the company received additional financing through various debt financings and equity offerings totaling 56 billion in gross proceeds see note 8 – “longterm debt” for further information on the debt financings the nclh equity offerings in may july and november 2020 resulted in 100984848 ordinary shares being issued which does not include any ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to our exchangeable notes we have taken additional measures to improve our liquidity through deferring certain ship milestone payments deferring certain debt amortization payments and extending certain maturities under other agreements including under our agreements with export credit agencies and related governments see note 8 – “longterm debt” for further information 

in january 2021 we amended our senior secured credit facility to further defer certain amortization payments prior to june 30 2022 and to waive certain financial and other covenants through december 31 2022 in connection with such amendment our minimum liquidity requirement was increased to 200 million and such requirement applies through december 31 2022 although the pride of america credit facility and jewel credit facility amortization was not deferred we have entered into an amendment to each facility to waive certain financial and other covenants through the maturity dates of such facilities the amendments to the pride of america credit facility and jewel credit facility also require us to maintain at least 200 million in free liquidity for the duration of the covenant waiver period in connection with the foregoing amendments nclc and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to make certain investments restricted payments prepayments of certain indebtedness and certain asset sales has also been further restricted the company intends to refinance the pride of america credit facility and jewel credit facility as soon as practicable

in addition in february 2021 we amended certain of our exportcredit backed facilities to defer amortization payments aggregating approximately 680 million through march 31 2022 we also amended all of our exportcredit backed facilities to provide that from the effective date of the amendments to and including december 31 2022 certain of the financial covenants under such facilities will be suspended and the free liquidity test will be replaced by a covenant to maintain at least 200 million in free liquidity the amendments also made certain other changes to the facilities including imposing further restrictions on nclc’s ability to incur debt create security issue equity and make dividends 

and other distributions see note 8 – “longterm debt” for further information on amendments completed subsequent to december 31 2020

the company has also undertaken several proactive cost reduction and cash conservation measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of the covid19 pandemic through the reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses including food fuel insurance port charges and reduced crew manning of vessels during the suspension resulting in lower crew payroll expense see “update regarding covid19 pandemic—financing transactions and cost containment measures” above for further information

the companys monthly average cash burn for the fourth quarter 2020 was approximately 190 million and included approximately 15 million per month of additional relaunchrelated expenses as the company began preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 in connection with the cdc conditional order which did not materialize the incremental relaunch costs were associated with crew restaffing repositioning and provisioning of vessels implementation of new health and safety protocols and a rampup of demandgenerating marketing investments which helped further stimulate the strong future demand the company is experiencing

for the first quarter of 2021 the company expects the average cash burn rate to temporarily remain elevated at approximately 190 million per month or approximately 170 million per month excluding nonrecurring debt modification costs as it ramps down relaunchrelated expenses and repatriates crew the company has incurred approximately 60 million of onetime debt deferral and modification costs and fees in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of successful debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions which combined with newbuild payment extensions have resulted in approximately 1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months once the ramp down of relaunchrelated expenses are complete the company expects its average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume 

cash burn rates include ongoing ship operating expenses administrative operating expenses interest expense taxes and expected nonnewbuild capital expenditures and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings newbuild related capital expenditures and other working capital changes future cash burn rate estimates also exclude unforeseen expenses the fourth quarter 2020 cash burn rate and first quarter 2021 estimate also reflect the deferral of debt amortization and newbuild related payments

we continue to expect a gradual phased relaunch of our ships after the voyage suspension period with our ships initially operating at reduced occupancy levels the timing for bringing our ships back to service and the percentage of our fleet in service will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic further resurgences and new variants of covid19 the availability distribution and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 our ability to comply with governmental regulations port availability travel restrictions bans and advisories and our ability to restaff our ships and implement new health and safety protocols the estimation of our future cash flow projections includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties until we are able to begin our phased relaunch our projected liquidity requirements reflect our principal assumptions surrounding ongoing operating costs during the suspension of cruise voyages as well as liquidity requirements for financing costs and necessary capital expenditures and our ability to implement further cash conservation strategies refer to note 2 – “summary of significant accounting policies” for further information on liquidity and management’s plan

there can be no assurance that the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the covid19 global pandemic based on the liquidity estimates and our current resources we have concluded we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for at least the next twelve months even in the event we do not resume cruise voyages during that period nonetheless we anticipate that we will need additional equity andor debt financing to fund our operations in the future especially if our suspension of cruise voyages is prolonged 

at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants subsequent to december 31 2020 we have received certain financial and other debt covenant waivers through december 31 2022 and added new free liquidity requirements if we do not continue to remain in compliance with our covenants we would have to seek to amend the covenants however no assurances can be made that such amendments would be approved by our lenders 

generally if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs then pursuant to cross default andor cross acceleration clauses substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse impact to our operations and liquidity 

since march 2020 moody’s has downgraded our longterm issuer rating to b2 our senior secured rating to b1 and our senior unsecured rating to caa1 since april 2020 sp global has downgraded our issuer credit rating to b lowered our issuelevel rating on our 875 million revolving loan facility and 15 billion term loan a facility to bb our issuelevel rating on our 675 million 2024 senior secured notes and 750 million 2026 senior secured notes to bb and our senior unsecured rating to b if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt or equity financing will be further negatively impacted there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations 

as of december 31 2020 we had advance ticket sales of 12 billion including the longterm portion which included approximately 085 billion of future cruise credits we also have agreements with our credit card processors that as of december 31 2020 governed approximately 10 billion in advance ticket sales that had been received by the company relating to future voyages these agreements allow the credit card processors to require under certain circumstances including the existence of a material adverse change excessive chargebacks and other triggering events that the company maintain a reserve which would be satisfied by posting collateral although the agreements vary these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a percentage of customer payments withheld or providing cash funds directly to the card processor any cash reserve or collateral requested could be increased or decreased 

as of december 31 2020 we had a reserve of approximately 200 million with a credit card processor recognized in other longterm assets and in january 2021 we provided additional cash collateral of 250 million additionally we are required to fund all refunds until further notice and 100 of incoming advance ticket sales deposits with this credit card processor will be withheld and are not expected to the released until the credit card processor’s exposure is fully collateralized as of december 31 2020 the exposure was approximately 780 million the reserve shortfall of approximately 330 million after taking into effect the january additional collateral provided will decrease as refunds are funded cruises are provided and amounts withheld by the credit card processor are allocated to the reserve rather than remitted to the company we may be required to find new credit card processors pledge additional collateral andor post cash reserves or take other actions that may further reduce our liquidity

in this section references to 2020 refer to the year ended december 31 2020 and references to 2019 refer to the year ended december 31 2019 

net cash used in operating activities was 26 billion in 2020 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 18 billion in 2019 this decrease was due to the suspension of global cruise voyages during 2020 the net cash used in operating activities in 2020 included net loss of 40 billion a decrease in advance ticket sales of 8118 million and timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities which was offset primarily by a 16 billion impairment loss the change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 includes net income of 9302 million as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities including an increase in advance ticket sales of 3474 million

repayments of our revolving loan facility and the net refinancing of term loans partially offset by the issuance of new debt 

for the company’s cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 27 2020

future capital commitments 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts after recent deferrals anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts were 04 billion 16 billion and 25 billion for the years ending december 31 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively the company has export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 02 billion 08 billion and 18 billion for the years ending december 31 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively subsequent to december 31 2020 we also have a memorandum of agreement in place to finance another 352 million future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense

for the norwegian brand project leonardo will introduce six additional ships each ranging from approximately 140000 to 156300 gross tons with approximately 3300 to 3550 berths with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 for the regent brand we have one explorer class ship on order to be delivered in 2023 which will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

the combined contract prices of the nine ships on order for delivery was approximately €71 billion or 87 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2020 we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship subject to certain conditions we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur however if any such events were to occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 252 million and 329 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

 ​ 

other 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these transactions were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

we refer you to “—liquidity and capital resources” for information regarding collateral provided to our credit card processors

funding sources 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other ratios substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2020

in addition our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor pay dividends to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have a significant impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations

in light of the measures described under update regarding covid19—financing transactions and cost containment measures we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12month period certain debt covenant waivers were received in 2021 to enable the company to maintain this compliance refer to “—liquidity and capital resources” for further information regarding the debt covenant waivers there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations furthermore we anticipate that we will need additional equity andor debt financing to fund our operations in the future especially if our suspension of cruise voyages is prolonged

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 we had interest rate swap and collar agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2020 74 of our debt was fixed and 26 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps and collars the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate derivative agreements was 07 billion as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2019 78 of our debt was fixed and 22 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps and collars the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate derivative agreements was 17 billion as of 

december 31 2019 the change in our fixed rate percentage from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 was primarily due to the maturity of interest rate swaps

based on our december 31 2020 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 319 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of december 31 2020 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €50 billion or 61 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2019 the payments not hedged aggregated €30 billion or 34 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2019 the change from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 was due to the delivery of seven seas splendor we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2020 would result in a 06 billion change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 156 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 112 for the year ended december 31 2019 we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2020 excluding fuel swaps for transactions that are no longer probable of occurrence we had hedged approximately 59 37 and 15 of our 2021 2022 and 2023 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively as of december 31 2019 we had hedged approximately 50 and 18 of our 2021 and 2022 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively additional hedges were executed between december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 to lower our fuel price risk

we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2021 fuel expense by 295 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 175 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

history and development of the company 

norwegian commenced operations from miami in 1966 launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from miami to the caribbean in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 0001 per share in january 2013 nclh completed its ipo and the ordinary shares of nclc which were owned entirely by the sponsors were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” at the same time nclh contributed 4600 million to nclc and the historical financial statements of nclc became those of nclh the corporate reorganization was affected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure as a result of the secondary equity offerings as of december 2018 the sponsors no longer owned the ordinary shares they held in nclh

strong cash flow 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing in terms of newbuild capital expenditures the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027 subject to certain conditions

highly experienced team 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries see “information about our executive officers” below

our business strategies 

driving demand 

we seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several ways including

 

our valueaddedvacation product itinerary diversification marketing and sales initiatives and the strengthening of our global footprint contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet our markettofill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and valueadded promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price

our destination management team reviews deployments across the fleet either repositioning ships to new destinations or finetuning itineraries with the goal of diversifying our deployment and creating product scarcity which in turn leads to higher pricing

​ 

we also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television robust and varied digital campaigns or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments our sales forces are also drivers of demand particularly in terms of educating travel advisors on our products and services in order to better sell to potential vacationers

lastly our international efforts are aimed at strengthening our global footprint by increasing brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing we maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of north america including the united kingdom europe hong kong australia new zealand brazil india japan and singapore

​ 

our new ships are designed to enhance energy efficiency and we have several initiatives in place to improve efficiency on our existing fleet some of these initiatives include led lighting upgrades waste heat recovery new hull coatings and itinerary optimization 

​

​ 

measured fleet expansion 

norwegian encore was delivered in october 2019 this ship is the largest in our fleet at approximately 169000 gross tons with approximately 4000 berths she is similar in design to norwegian bliss and includes additional innovative features project leonardo consists of six ships on order for the norwegian brand with expected delivery dates through 2027 subject to certain conditions each of the six project leonardo ships are approximately 140000 gross tons and 3300 berths for the regent brand seven seas splendor was delivered in january 2020 we have an order for one additional explorer class ship to be delivered in 2023 each of the explorer class ships will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027 subject to certain conditions

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels 

the retailtravel advisor channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel advisors worldwide we have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives to enhance and facilitate the ability of travel advisors to market and sell our products we have expanded sales teams who work closely with our travel advisor partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training this education creates a deeper understanding of all our product offerings

we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites mobile applications and passenger services departments including our personal cruise consultants who offer personalized service throughout the process of designing cruise vacations for our guests we have also enhanced our capabilities to enable guests to customize their vacation experience with certain onboard product offerings we also have an onboard cruise sales channel where guests can book their next cruise or purchase cruise certificates to apply to their next cruise while vacationing on our ships 

​ 

our meetings incentives and charters channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction sixthman a subsidiary company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters provides a market that enables travel advisors to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests

itineraries 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180days calling on worldwide locations including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on varied destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

for some of our longer itineraries we strive to maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last 7 to 20 days in order to capture more timeconstrained customers we believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises

passenger ticket revenue 

we offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities meals entertainment and port fees and taxes in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation complimentary beverages unlimited shore excursions free internet precruise hotel packages and on some of the exotic itineraries pre or post land packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place

onboard and other revenue 

all three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare including casino operations certain food and beverage shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo services wifi services and other similar items food and beverage casino operations photo services and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs to maximize onboard revenue all three brands use various crossmarketing and promotional tools which are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services oceania cruises’ ticket prices may include air transportation and certain other amenities regent’s ticket prices typically include air transportation unlimited shore excursions a precruise hotel night stay for concierge level and above premium wines and top shelf liquors specialty restaurants wifi and gratuities 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 30 30 and 31 of our consolidated revenue in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

revenue management practices 

our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and uses trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in order to optimize cruise ticket revenue we utilize a markettofill strategy to encourage guests to book earlier which extends our booking window and drives higher pricing our targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering we emphasize communication to keep the travel advisors engaged and informed and utilize call centers to drive high potential targeted customers and increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs this marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated we believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

seasonality 

our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

competition 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival corporation and carnival plc which owns and operates carnival cruise line holland america line princess cruises and seabourn cruise line among others and royal caribbean cruises ltd which owns and operates royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises among others as well as other cruise lines such as msc cruises crystal cruises viking ocean cruises and virgin voyages in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions

marketing strategy 

our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and consideration of our products and services among consumers and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales we utilize a multichannel strategy that may include a combination of print television radio websiteecommerce direct mail social media mobile and email campaigns partnerships customer loyalty initiatives market research and businesstobusiness events

building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us we continue to optimize our customer databases and targeting capabilities to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive email direct mail and brochures with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities our marketing mix includes a balance of initiatives that both allow us to build our brand awareness to attract newtobrand customers while also focusing on more targeted marketing communications aimed at retaining our current guest base continued investments in our websites is also key not only to driving interest and bookings but also to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise

travel advisors are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts we provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel advisor partners through a variety of programs our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other bestselling practices advisors can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform

guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit information that helps shape future direction

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

ship maintenance and logistics 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel or twice in five years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed three years depending on flag state and age of vessel however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every five years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability we take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guestfacing services and innovative compliance technology

suppliers 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage advertising and marketing and travel advisor services most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition due to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

crew and staff 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry crew members are trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships to familiarize themselves and become proficient with the safety equipment onboard 

​ 

our captains and chief engineers are experienced seafarers our bridge and technical officers regularly undergo rigorous operations training such as leadership navigation stability statutory and environmental regulatory compliance to support our deck and engine officers while at sea we have bridge and engine resource management protocols in place dictating specific standard operating procedures our bridge teams conduct a voyage planning process prior to sailing where the upcoming itinerary is reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to departure and in preparation for arrival in addition all of our ships employ stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

prior to every cruise setting sail we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show a safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems we have developed a safety management system “sms” which establishes policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms is approved and audited regularly by our classification society lloyds register and it also undergoes regular internal audits as well as periodic inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port and state authorities 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels

trademarks and tradenames 

under the norwegian brand we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” and “feel free” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the “freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” we believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout north america europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value

under the regent brand we own registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “seven seas cruises” and “an unrivaled experience” as well as the names of our ships except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending 

we also claim common law rights in trademarks and tradenames used in conjunction with our ships incentive programs customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships for each of our brands

regulatory issues 

registration of our ships 

nineteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship eight of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

environmental protection 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge waste water management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various water and air qualityrelated requirements

with regard to air quality requirements the international maritime organization’s “imo” convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 beginning january 2020 various compliance methods such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized

marpol also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated emission control areas “ecas” which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel north american waters and the us caribbean sea ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods ecas have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen from newly built ships additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around norway japan and the mediterranean sea being considered

ballast water discharges are governed by the marpol ballast water management convention which came into force in 2017 “the convention” and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization may contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different 

or potentially unsuitable environments applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species

marpol also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage oil and sewage from ships including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage without causing delay to ships ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021

these requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” and the us coast guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federallyprotected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” program authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vesselspecific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

the act to prevent pollution from ships which implements certain elements of marpol in the us provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases the laws have no statutory limits of liability among the most stringent requirements are those set by the state of alaska which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

the european union “eu” has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the eu requires the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports passenger ships on regular service to eu ports and not operating in an eca are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 15 the eu has set january 2020 as the compliance date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahamas ltd and ncl america llc are certified under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms and promote environmental awareness among our stakeholders both through our sail  sustain program and annual stewardship report

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

permits for glacier bay alaska 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through september 30 2029 

passenger wellbeing 

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the fda we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

security and safety 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification 

requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

maritimelabor 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers as amended “stcw” establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

financial requirements 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 320 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments also our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the uk and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions as of december 31 2019 we have in place approximately british pound sterling 415 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to €1100 million 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

taxation 

us income taxation 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being 

claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq stock market the “nasdaq” until december 18 2017 and since december 19 2017 have been primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” both the nasdaq and the nyse are considered to be established securities markets in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent and oceania cruises was treated as a corporation until december 31 2017 and a disregarded entity as of january 1 2018 for 2019 2018 and 2017 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to us federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 21 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively 

connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

other united states taxation 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

uk income taxation 

nclh and nclc are tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

changes in tax laws 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 4000 employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 32000 shipboard employees regent and oceania cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

risks related to the company 

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes floods and typhoons fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs and the frequency and severity of natural disasters may increase due to climate change the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us the expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and 

results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor increased expenditures

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade trade disputes and increased tariffs could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism for example the recent outbreak of the covid19 coronavirus has resulted in costs and lost revenue related to customer compensation itinerary modifications travel restrictions and advisories the unavailability of ports andor destinations cancellations and redeployments and has impacted consumer sentiment regarding cruise travel the spread of the covid19 coronavirus particularly in north america could exacerbate its effect on us any future wideranging health scares would also likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations subject us to significant fines penalties and damages and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and disruptions to these systems or networks could impair our operations have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks our business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security may not prevent disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information the security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business our systems and networks may be vulnerable to computer viruses malware worms hackers and other security issues including physical and electronic breakins router disruption sabotage or espionage disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denialofservice attacks for example in october 2018 we discovered limited instances of unauthorized access to certain employee email communications some of which contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information we have 

implemented additional safeguards and we do not believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident however there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in addition we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches unauthorized access or other cyberattacks or incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents our failure to successfully prevent mitigate or timely respond to such incidents could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation

we are also subject to laws in multiple jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data including the european union’s general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act noncompliance with these and other privacy laws or the compromise of information systems used by us or our service providers resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests employees or vendors could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment the regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems or a cyberattack or other cyber incident we may incur costs associated with the following response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement data restoration regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees damages and settlements in addition data security breaches a cyberattack or other cyber incident may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data loss of company assets damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations for example as of january 2020 the imo’s convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships marpol set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the previous 35 global limit various compliance methods such as the use of lowsulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized we have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet which will allow us to continue to use highsulfur fuel on those ships in certain areas however if exhaust gas cleaning systems are not widely used in the industry low demand for highsulfur fuel may increase the price for such fuel ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning systems and in specified areas even ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems will be required to use lowsulfur fuels lowsulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

mechanical malfunctions and repairs delays in our shipbuilding program maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair for example in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

we have operations in and source passengers from the uk and member countries of the european union effective as of january 31 2020 the uk withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” during a transition period set to expire on december 31 2020 it will remain in the single market and be subject to the european union’s rules and regulations while the british government continues to negotiate the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and we do not know to what extent brexit will ultimately impact the business environment in the uk the rest of the european union or other countries the withdrawal could also adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject and disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european 

union which could make it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety health and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes floods typhoons and earthquakes financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies for example we had to temporarily change certain itineraries in the caribbean due to damage some ports sustained during an active hurricane season in 2017 there can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future additionally in june 2019 the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury removed the authorization for group peopletopeople educational travel by us persons to cuba concurrently the united states department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security removed the authorization to travel for most noncommercial aircraft and all passenger and recreational vessels including cruise ships on temporary sojourn in cuba combined these rulings effectively eliminated the ability of cruise lines to offer cruise travel to cuba due to environmental and overcrowding concerns some local governments have begun to take measures to limit the number of cruise ships and passengers allowed at certain destinations for example dubrovnik venice and barcelona have either implemented or considered implementing such limitations on cruise ships and passengers limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports have adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations in the past and could do so in the future

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add nine additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations additionally older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we or other members of our protection and indemnity associations were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected for example in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

our indebtedness and the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a significant portion of our assets including many of our ships are collateral under our debt agreements 

a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy and the industry in which we operate we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness which may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay dividends or make distributions to nclh repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

our existing debt agreements also require us and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may require us to maintain minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse 

effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness and there is no assurance that we would have sufficient current assets to repay such indebtedness in full if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which includes a significant portion of our assets including many of our ships any such action would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

the us government announced that effective may 2 2019 it will no longer suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of 1996 popularly known as the helmsburton act allowing certain individuals whose property was confiscated by the cuban government beginning in 1959 to sue anyone who traffics in the property in question in us courts claims have now been brought against us and other companies who have done business in cuba if these suits are successful they could result in substantial monetary damages against the company

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

certain of our debt agreements use libor as a reference rate for interest rate calculations in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is intended to replace us dollar libor plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced at this time we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our results of operations in addition some of our debt agreements which use libor as a reference rate do not contain fallback reference rates if libor is discontinued we may incur additional costs related to contract renegotiation for such agreements

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

currently we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain crew members any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation” as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

the government of bermuda recently enacted the economic substance act 2018 which sets forth minimum economic substance requirements for entities established in bermuda the company is currently analyzing these rules in anticipation of further guidance from bermuda authorities on the application of the economic substance act 2018 if the company is unable to comply with such requirements the company may consider alternate jurisdictions or otherwise become subject to tax regimes which may be less favorable

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental health and safety labor data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

increasingly stringent and complex international federal state and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union individual countries the united states and individual states have implemented and are considering new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol imo’s requirements governing environmental protection and stcw an imo regulation governing ship manning in the united states the environmental protection agency and the us coast guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations

the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands and waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems

these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact 

in the past states have implemented taxes that impact the cruise industry it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

existing and future legal and regulatory restrictions on our ability to collect and use data could also negatively affect our ability to market our business result in increased compliance costs and otherwise affect our business processes all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

nclh does not currently pay dividends on its ordinary shares 

nclh does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include

 

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of 

rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

​ 

in the normal course of our business various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount

​ 

nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery however based on our current knowledge we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial presentation 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report see also “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” immediately prior to part i item 1 in this annual report 

we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment port fees and taxes and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from casino beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services and photo services our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting and asset impairment

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the weighted average useful lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship when we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ship’s cost basis we estimate the net book value of the component being retired and remove it from the ship’s cost basis repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

we determine the weighted average useful lives of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the useful lives of the ships’ major component systems on the date of acquisition such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull the useful lives of ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components in addition to determine the useful lives of the ship or ship components we consider the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets manufacturer recommended lives and anticipated changes in technological conditions given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require judgment and are uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated weighted average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2019 would have increased by 129 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 664 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

asset impairment 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates judgments and projections as necessary our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk

we evaluate goodwill and tradenames for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value for tradenames we also provide a qualitative assessment to determine if there is any indication of impairment

in order to make this evaluation we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist



 

we also may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step i test which consists of a combined approach using discounted future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units the market approach considers revenue and ebitda multiples from an appropriate peer group our discounted cash flow valuation reflects our principal assumptions of 1 forecasted future operating results and growth rates 2 forecasted capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements and 3 a weighted average cost of capital of market participants adjusted for an optimal capital structurewe believe that the combined approach is the most representative method to assess fair value as it utilizes expectations of longterm growth as well as current market conditions for the tradenames we may also use a quantitative assessment which utilizes the relief from royalty method and includes the same forecasts and discount rates from the discounted cash flow valuation in the goodwill assessment along with a tradename royalty rate assumption

​ 

we have concluded that our business has three reporting units each brand oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment 

as of december 31 2019 there was 5230 million 4621 million and 4038 million of goodwill for the oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian reporting units respectively for our 2019 annual goodwill impairment evaluation we elected to perform quantitative tests for the each of the reporting units based on the results of the step 1 tests we determined there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value of the regent seven seas and norwegian reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values the fair value of the oceania cruises reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 24 however a change in the conditions of any reporting unit may result in a decline in fair value in future periods as of december 31 2019 our tests supported the carrying values of these assets and we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these and other nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures 

on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

in addition adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred secondary equity offering expenses of 09 million similar expenses were not incurred in the year ended december 31 2019 we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since these expenses were not representative of our daytoday operations and we have included similar nonrepresentative adjustments in prior periods

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

summary of significant 2019 events 

in january 2019 we a reduced the pricing of our existing 875 million revolving loan facility b reduced the pricing and increased the approximately 13 billion principal amount outstanding under the term loan a facility to 16 billion and c extended the maturity dates for our revolving loan facility and our term loan a facility to 2024 subject to certain conditions 

in june 2019 the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury removed the authorization for group peopletopeople educational travel by us persons to cuba as a result we have stopped sailings to cuba effective june 5 2019 and revised the affected itineraries the estimated negative impact resulting from this regulatory change was approximately 045 to both diluted eps and adjusted eps for the year ended december 31 2019 we expect the negative impact to diluted eps and adjusted eps to continue into 2020 as a result of the cessation of cruises to cuba 

in october 2019 norwegian encore was delivered

in december 2019 we redeemed 5650 million principal amount of the outstanding 475 senior notes due 2021 and issued 5650 million of 3625 senior notes due 2024

revenue 

total revenue increased 67 to 65 billion in 2019 compared to 61 billion in 2018 primarily due to an increase in capacity days and improved pricing gross yield increased 46 net revenue increased 51 to 49 billion in 2019 from 47 billion in 2018 due to an increase in capacity days of 21 and an increase in net yield of 29 the increase in capacity days was primarily due to a full year of norwegian bliss in 2019 and the introduction of norwegian encore to the fleet during the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by a reduction in capacity days while norwegian joy was undergoing revitalization and other repairs and maintenance for our fleet including scheduled drydocks  the increase in gross yield and net yield was primarily due to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and onboard spending on a constant currency basis net yield increased 36

expense 

total cruise operating expense increased 85 in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase in capacity days the redeployment of norwegian joy during the second quarter of 2019 and incremental direct costs related to air promotions gross cruise cost increased 85 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in total cruise operating expense and marketing general and administrative expenses total other operating expense increased 111 in 2019 compared to 2018 marketing general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the additions of norwegian encore and norwegian bliss and ship improvement projects net cruise cost per capacity day increased 45 51 on a constant 

currency basis due to an increase in marketing general and administrative expenses costs associated with the cessation of cruises to cuba and other ship operating costs  adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 55 62 on a constant currency basis we refer you to the “results of operations” above for a reconciliation of total cruise operating expense to adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel

interest expense net was 2729 million in 2019 compared to 2704 million in 2018 the increase in 2019 includes 167 million of losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs in 2019 interest expense also reflects lower outstanding debt balances and lower margins associated with recent refinancings partially offset by newbuild financings and an increase in libor 2018 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 63 million

other income expense net was income of 62 million in 2019 compared to income of 207 million in 2018 other income in 2019 was primarily due to gains from insurance proceeds and a litigation settlement partially offset by losses on foreign currency exchange other income in 2018 was primarily due to gains on foreign currency exchange

income tax benefit expense was a benefit of 189 million in 2019 compared to an expense of 145 million in 2018 during 2018 we implemented certain tax restructuring strategies that created our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of prestige for which we had previously provided a full valuation allowance as a result in 2019 we recorded a tax benefit of 357 million in connection with the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

as of december 31 2019 our liquidity was 11 billion consisting of 2529 million in cash and cash equivalents and 8750 million available under our revolving loan facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

as of december 31 2019 we had a working capital deficit of 29 billion this deficit included 20 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our revolving loan facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

we evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity including the capital markets in the ordinary course of business we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure taking into consideration our current and expected capital requirements our assessment of prevailing market conditions and expectations regarding future conditions and the contractual and other restrictions to which we are subject

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions andor to pay dividends to nclc and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

in january 2019 we a reduced the pricing of our existing 8750 million revolving loan facility b reduced the pricing and increased the approximately 13 billion principal amount outstanding under the term loan a facility to 16 billion and c extended the maturity dates for our revolving loan facility and our term loan a facility to 2024 subject to certain conditions we used the proceeds from the increase in our term loan a facility to prepay all of the then outstanding amounts under the term loan b facility in addition in december 2019 we redeemed 5650 million principal amount of the then outstanding 475 senior notes due 2021 and issued 5650 million of 3625 senior notes due 2024 see note 8 longterm debt to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information about these refinancing activities as well as our other debt agreements

sources and uses of cash 

in this section references to 2019 refer to the year ended december 31 2019 and references to 2018 refer to the year ended december 31 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities was 18 billion in 2019 compared to 21 billion in 2018 the net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included net income of 9302 million an increase in advance ticket sales of 3474 million and timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities the change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 includes net income of 9548 million as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities including an increase in advance ticket sales of 2626 million

net cash used in investing activities was 17 billion in 2019 primarily related to payments for the delivery of norwegian encore ships under construction ship improvement projects and shoreside projects net cash used in investing activities was 15 billion in 2018 primarily related to payments for the delivery of norwegian bliss ship improvements ships under construction and shoreside projects 

net cash used in financing activities was 534 million in 2019 primarily due to the repurchase of 3499 million of nclh’s ordinary shares net repayments of our revolving loan facility and the net refinancing of term loans partially offset by the issuance of new debt net cash used in financing activities was 5848 million in 2018 reflecting the net repayment of our revolving loan facility repayments on other loan facilities the repurchase of nclh’s ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other partially offset by the proceeds from borrowings on newbuild loan facilities 

for the company’s cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017 see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 27 2019

future capital commitments 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment projects as of december 31 2019 anticipated capital expenditures were 14 billion 12 billion and 26 billion for the years ending december 31 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively we have export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 05 billion 02 billion and 13 billion for the years ending december 31 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively these future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense as we take delivery of the ships

for the norwegian brand project leonardo will introduce an additional six ships each approximately 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 subject to certain conditions for the regent brand seven seas splendor was delivered in january 2020 we have an order for one additional explorer class ship to be delivered in 2023 each of the explorer class ships will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

the combined contract prices of the 10 ships on order for delivery as of december 31 2019 including seven seas splendor which was delivered in january 2020 was approximately €74 billion or 83 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2019 we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship subject to certain conditions we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur however if any such events were to occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 329 million and 304 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

offbalance sheet transactions 

none

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2019 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

​ 

 

 other 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these transactions were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

funding sources 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2019

in addition our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor pay dividends to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our revolving loan facility and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12month period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

​ 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2019 we had interest rate swap and collar agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2019 78 of our debt was fixed and 22 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps and collars the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swaps and collars was 17 billion as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2018 72 of our debt was fixed and 28 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was 10 billion as of december 31 2018 the change in our fixed rate percentage from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 was primarily due to higher outstanding fixed rate debt and additional interest rate swaps and collars executed

based on our december 31 2019 outstanding variable rate debt balance and adding as variable debt the principle amount of debt associated with interest rate swap agreements that matured on january 2 2020 a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 209 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of december 31 2019 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €30 billion or 34 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2018 the payments not hedged aggregated €22 billion or 25 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2018 the change from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 was due to the delivery of a ship in october 2019 and additional foreign exchange derivatives executed we estimate that a 10 change 

in the euro as of december 31 2019 would result in a 03 billion change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 112 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 116 for the year ended december 31 2018 we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2019 we had hedged approximately 56 50 and 18 of our 2020 2021 and 2022 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively as of december 31 2018 we had hedged approximately 57 53 and 33 of our 2019 2020 and 2021 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively the change in fuel price risk from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 was due to additional fuel hedges executed

we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2020 fuel expense by 500 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 230 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

history and development of the company 

  

norwegian commenced operations from miami in 1966 launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from miami to the caribbean in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 001 per share in january 2013 nclh completed its ipo and the ordinary shares of nclc which were owned entirely by the sponsors were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” at the same time nclh contributed 4600 million to nclc and the historical financial statements of nclc became those of nclh the corporate reorganization was affected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure

strong cash flow 

 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing in terms of newbuild capital expenditures the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027 subject to certain conditions

 

highly experienced management team 

 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries see “executive officers” below

  



 

 

our business strategies 

 

driving demand 

 

we seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several ways including

 

  

  

  

  

our valueaddedvacation product itinerary diversification marketing and sales initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet our markettofill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and valueadded promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price

  

diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination management team which reviews deployments across the fleet either repositioning ships to new destinations or finetuning itineraries with the goal of creating product scarcity which in turn leads to higher pricing

  

we also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television robust and varied digital campaigns or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments our sales forces are also drivers of demand particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products and services in order to better sell to potential vacationers

  

lastly our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing we maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of north america including the united kingdom europe china australia new zealand brazil india japan and singapore 

  

leveraging scale to suppress costs 

  

we continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization this initiative is bolstered by our supply chain and logistics management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices

  

enhanced product offerings and guest experience 

  

norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea oceania cruises’ awardwinning onboard dining with multiple open seating dining venues is a central highlight of its cruise experience regent’s allinclusive offering includes air transportation shore excursions precruise hotel stays for concierge level and above specialty restaurants premium spirits and fine wines gratuities wifi and other amenities

  

maximize revenue 

  

we focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and occupancy percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue our specific initiatives include

 

strategic relationships we have strategic relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times

  

promotional strategy with our norwegian brand we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice of multiple amenities

  

casino player strategy we have nonexclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests these arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending

  



 

 

optimization of deployment we manage our ships’ deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance

  

ship refurbishments we have invested in revitalizations to our ships which provides a product which we believe delivers higher guest satisfaction and in turn higher pricing

  

measured fleet expansion 

  

we have norwegian encore on order for delivery in the fall of 2019 this ship will be the largest in our fleet reaching approximately 168000 gross tons with approximately 4000 berths she will be similar in design to norwegian bliss which was delivered in april 2018 and will include additional innovative features project leonardo consists of six ships on order for the norwegian brand with expected delivery dates through 2027 subject to certain conditions each of the six project leonardo ships are approximately 140000 gross tons and 3300 berths for the regent brand we have orders for two explorer class ships seven seas splendor and an additional ship to be delivered in 2020 and 2023 respectively each of the explorer class ships will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

 

we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2027 subject to certain conditions

 

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations

 

we focus on distribution through our three primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters”

 

retailtravel agent the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe africa asia and australia we have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives we have expanded sales teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training this education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings

 

international   the international channel represents an underpenetrated channel of distribution and one that we have increased focus on since 2015 focus on this market accomplishes the dual objective of allowing us to grow our yields and capacity faster than if we only focused on the north american market while also allowing us to diversify our risk as part of this focus we have undertaken a threepronged strategy of

 

  

as part of this strategy we have opened offices in sydney shanghai beijing hong kong mumbai tokyo auckland and singapore and expanded or renovated our existing offices in southampton sao paulo and wiesbaden

 

for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks”

 

meetings incentives and charters this channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction the acquisition of sixthman in 2012 a company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters opened up a new market for travel partners enabling travel partners to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests

 



 

 

itineraries 

 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180days calling on worldwide locations including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean including the republic of cuba we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world

 

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on varied destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

 

for some of our longer itineraries we strive to maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last 7 to 20 days in order to capture more timeconstrained customers we believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises

 

passenger ticket revenue 

 

we offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities as well as meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation complimentary beverages unlimited shore excursions free internet precruise hotel packages and on some of the exotic itineraries pre or post land packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place

 

onboard and other revenue 

 

all three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare including casino operations certain food and beverage gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items food and beverage casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities some internet services and various sports programs norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations food and beverage shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items to maximize onboard revenue norwegian uses various crossmarketing and promotional tools which are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services oceania cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities regent’s offerings typically include air transportation unlimited shore excursions a precruise hotel night stay for concierge level and above premium wines and top shelf liquors specialty restaurants wifi and gratuities both regent and oceania cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations gift shop purchases premium shore excursions and spa services

 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 30 31 and 30 of our consolidated revenue in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

 

revenue management practices 

 

our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing we concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields we execute targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering in both north american and select international markets to increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers this marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns we believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

 



 

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

 

competition 

 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival corporation and carnival plc which owns and operates carnival cruise line holland america line princess cruises and seabourn cruise line among others and royal caribbean cruises ltd which owns and operates royal caribbean international celebrity cruises azamara club cruises and silversea cruises among others as well as other cruise lines such as msc cruises crystal cruises and viking ocean cruises in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

 

sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions

 

marketing strategy 

 

our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and consideration of our products and services among consumers and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales we utilize a multichannel strategy that may include a combination of print television radio websiteecommerce direct mail social media mobile and email campaigns partnerships customer loyalty initiatives market research and businesstobusiness events

 

building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us we have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities continued investments in our websites is also key not only to driving interest and bookings but also to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise

 

travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts we provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other bestselling practices agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform

 

guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit information that helps shape future direction

  

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

 

ship maintenance and logistics 

 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel twice in 5 years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years depending age of vessel and flag state however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability we take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guestfacing services and innovative compliance technology

 



 

 

suppliers 

 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage advertising and marketing and travel agent services most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

 

crew and staff 

 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships

 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains and watch standing officers regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

 

prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits

 

we have developed safety management systems “sms” which establish policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms are approved and audited regularly by our classification society lloyds register and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annualsemiannual inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port and state authorities we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments

 

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

 

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

  



 

 

  

  

our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to certain limitations exclusions and deductible levels

 

trademarks and tradenames 

 

under the norwegian brand we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” and “feel free” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the “freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” we believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout north america europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value

regulatory issues 

 

registration of our ships 

 

eighteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship seven of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

 

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

  

environmental protection 

 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge waste water management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various water and air qualityrelated requirements

 



 

 

with regard to air quality requirements the international maritime organization’s “imo” convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the current 35 global limit beginning january 2020 various compliance methods such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized

 

marpol also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated emission control areas “ecas” which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel north american waters and the us caribbean sea ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods ecas have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen from newly built ships additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around norway japan and the mediterranean sea being considered

 

ballast water discharges are governed by the marpol ballast water management convention which came into force in 2017 “the convention” and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization may contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different or potentially unsuitable environments applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species

 

marpol also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage oil and sewage from ships including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage without causing delay to ships ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks

 

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited stricter discharge restrictions will be in effect for new passenger ships in 2019 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021

 

these requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

 

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” and the us coast guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federallyprotected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” program authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vesselspecific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

 

the act to prevent pollution from ships which implements certain elements of marpol in the us provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

 

the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

 

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases the laws have no statutory limits of liability among the most stringent requirements are those set by the state of alaska which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

 



 

 

the european union “eu” has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

 

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the eu requires the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports passenger ships on regular service to eu ports and not operating in an eca are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 15 the eu has set january 2020 as the compliance date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters

 

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahamas ltd and ncl america llc are certified under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms promoting environmental awareness both through our sail  sustain program and annual stewardship report

 

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

  

permits for glacier bay alaska 

 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 our renewal application for glacier bay national park and preserve was submitted in 2018 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future

 

passenger wellbeing 

 

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the us food and drug administration “fda” we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

 

security and safety 

 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

 

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

 

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

 



 

 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

 

maritimelabor 

 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” as amended establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

  

financial requirements 

 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 300 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments also our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the uk as of december 31 2018 approximately british pound sterling 305 million was in place as a security guarantee we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions

 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

 

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

  

taxation 

 

us income taxation 

 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

 

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

 



 

 

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq stock market the “nasdaq” until december 18 2017 and since december 19 2017 have been primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” both the nasdaq and the nyse are considered to be established securities markets in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

 

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent pch and oceania cruises was treated as a corporation until december 31 2017 and a disregarded entity as of january 1 2018 for 2018 2017 and 2016 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above

 

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

 

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

 

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to us federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate 21 rate effective january 1 2018 and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

 

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

  

other united states taxation 

 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

  



 

  

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

 

uk income taxation 

 

nclh and nclc are tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

  

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

 

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

changes in tax laws 

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted and among other provisions reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 also in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 which addresses the recognition of provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes by the act the measurement period ends when a company has obtained prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting but cannot extend beyond one year the company completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act there was no material change to the 74 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities which represents future tax expenses recorded in 2017 as a discrete tax benefit resulting from the lower us federal corporate income tax rate under the act other aspects of the act were either not applicable or did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2018 we employed approximately 3200 employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 30000 shipboard employees regent and oceania cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

  

risks related to the company 

  

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

 

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes floods and typhoons fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us the expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor expenditures

  

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union trade disputes and increased tariffs could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

  



 

 

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected

  

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we have made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs the integrity and reliability of these systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and disruptions to these systems or networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks while we have and continue to invest in business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security we cannot completely insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

 

as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information including email addresses home addresses and financial data such as credit card information the security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business despite our implementation of security measures to protect against security breaches unauthorized access to our data and other cyberattacks or incidents our systems and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses malware worms hackers and other security issues including physical and electronic breakins router disruption sabotage or espionage disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denialofservice attacks for example in october 2018 we discovered limited instances of unauthorized access to certain employee email communications some of which contained proprietary business and personally identifiable information we have implemented additional safeguards and we do not believe that we experienced any material losses related to this incident however there can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future in addition we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches unauthorized access or other cyberattacks or incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents our failure to successfully prevent mitigate or timely respond to any breach attack or unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation

 

we are also subject to laws relating to privacy of personal data including european union data privacy regulations the compromise of our information systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests or employees could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment

 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems or a cyberattack or other cyber incident we may incur costs associated with the following response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement data restoration regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees damages and settlements in addition data security breaches a cyberattack or other cyber incident may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data loss of company assets damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

  



 

 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

 

we have operations in and source passengers from the uk and other member countries of the european union on june 23 2016 voters in the uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union negotiations on the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union are ongoing with the uk due to exit the european union on march 29 2019 while negotiations are continuing there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal current discussions between the uk and the european union may result in any number of outcomes including an extension or delay of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union the consequences for the economies of the uk and other european union member states as a result of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union are unknown and unpredictable which could make it more difficult to source passengers from these regions the proposed withdrawal could also potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject and disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

changes in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices 

 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations for example the imo’s convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships marpol has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the current 35 global limit beginning january 2020 various compliance methods such as the use of lowsulfur fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may be utilized we have elected to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on some ships in our fleet which will allow us to continue to use highsulfur fuel on those ships however if exhaust gas cleaning systems are not widely used in the industry low demand for highsulfur fuel may increase the price for such fuel other ships in our fleet that do not have exhaust gas cleaning systems will be required to use lowsulfur fuels lowsulfur fuels may be costly due to increased demand and scarcity if suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to or may enter into in the future increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

  



 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

 

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets as we did with cuba and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add 11 additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations additionally older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices

 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes floods typhoons and earthquakes financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies for example we had to temporarily change certain itineraries in the caribbean due to damage some ports sustained during an active hurricane season in 2017 there can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future we garner a pricing premium from our itineraries to cuba as opposed to other caribbean itineraries if there is a change in the diplomatic relationship between the us and cuba or either government issued sanctions or regulations that affect travel to cuba it is possible that we will no longer include cuba in our itineraries any limitations on the availability of ports of call including cuba or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we or other members of our protection and indemnity associations were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected for example in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

 



 

 

evolving requirements and regulations regarding data privacy and protection and any actual or perceived compliance failures by us could increase our liability and costs and otherwise materially adversely affect our business operations 

 

we process and store sensitive information relating to our guests employees business partners and others and we are subject to requirements and regulations regarding data privacy and protection in multiple jurisdictions government regulators privacy advocates and individuals are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process store share and transmit personal data new laws governing data privacy and protection such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” have been enacted and more are being considered worldwide the gdpr contains stringent data privacy and protection requirements and enables regulators to impose significant penalties for noncompliance the regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another

 

any actual or perceived failure by us or our business partners to comply with posted privacy policies federal state or international data privacy and protection laws and regulations or privacy commitments contained in our contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors violate applicable laws or regulations or our policies such violations may also result in increased liability for us and have an adverse effect on our business

 

existing and future legal and regulatory restrictions on our ability to collect and use data could also negatively affect our ability to market our business result in increased compliance costs and otherwise affect our business processes all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results

 

our indebtedness and the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a significant portion of our assets including many of our ships are collateral under our debt agreements 

 

a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy and the industry in which we operate we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness which may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

 

in addition the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments including the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay dividends or make distributions to nclh repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness make certain investments or acquisitions transfer sell or create liens on certain assets and consolidate or merge with or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

 

our existing debt agreements also require us and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may require us to maintain minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

  

  



 

 

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness and there is no assurance that we would have sufficient current assets to repay such indebtedness in full if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which includes a significant portion of our assets including many of our ships any such action would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

 

certain of our debt agreements use libor as a reference rate for interest rate calculations in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve has begun publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is intended to replace us dollar libor plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced at this time we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our results of operations

  

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business

 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

 

delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs maintenance and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair for example in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

  



 

  

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

  

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

currently we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements four of these agreements are in effect through 2020 two through 2021 and two through 2027 any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

  

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

  



 

 

our revenue is seasonal owing to variations in passenger fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year we may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses during certain periods of the year 

 

the demand for our cruises is seasonal with the greatest demand for cruises generally occurring during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for drydocks which we typically schedule during offpeak demand periods for such ships accordingly seasonality in demand and drydock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during certain periods of the year

 

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

  

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

  

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

 

increasingly stringent and complex international federal state and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union individual countries the united states and individual states have implemented and are considering new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol imo’s requirements governing environmental protection and stcw an imo regulation governing ship manning in the united states the environmental protection agency and the us coast guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations

 



 

 

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations

 

among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot measure approved by alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” the law was relaxed somewhat in 2013 allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits an option that has eased compliance with certain wqs the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 this convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands and waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels or installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems

 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues”

 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

 

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

  

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 

 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

  

nclh does not currently pay dividends on its ordinary shares 

 

nclh does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

  



 

 

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include

 

  

  

  

  

  

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on september 21 2018 a purported classaction lawsuit was filed by marta and jerry phillips and others against ncl corporation ltd in the united states district court for the southern district of florida relating to the marketing and sales of our booksafe travel protection plan the plaintiffs purport to represent an alleged class of passengers who purchased booksafe travel protection plans the complaint alleges that the company concealed that it received proceeds on the sale of the travel insurance portion of the plan the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages fees and costs we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claim and that any liability which may arise as a result of this action will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 

in the normal course of our business various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount

 

nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery however based on our current knowledge we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

financial presentation 

 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report see also “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” immediately prior to part i item 1 in this annual report   

  

we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities as either “passenger ticket” revenue or “onboard and other” revenue passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services and photo services our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies

 

ship accounting 

 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

 



 

 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2018 would have increased by 133 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 659 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates judgments and projections as necessary our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk

 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in order to make this evaluation we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships goodwill tradenames and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge if a material change occurred we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step i test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units

  

for our annual impairment evaluation we performed a step 0 test for the norwegian regent seven seas and oceania cruises reporting units as of december 31 2018 there was 5230 million 4621 million and 4038 million of goodwill for the oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian reporting units respectively as of december 31 2018 our annual review consisting of the step 0 test supports the carrying value of these assets

 



 

 

contingencies 

 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue adjusted net revenue net yield adjusted net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these and other nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

 

in addition adjusted net revenue and adjusted net yield which exclude certain business combination accounting entries are nongaap financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net revenue adjusted net yield adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred an impairment of 29 million related to assets held for sale a similar impairment was not incurred in the years ended december 31 2018 or december 31 2016 we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since this impairment amount was not representative of our daytoday operations and we have included similar nonrepresentative adjustments in prior periods

 



 

 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

expense 

  

total cruise operating expense increased 102 in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the increase in capacity days gross cruise cost increased 114 in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher total cruise operating expense and to a lesser extent higher marketing general and administrative expenses total other operating expense increased 137 in 2018 compared to 2017 marketing general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher advertising expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the additions of norwegian joy and norwegian bliss and ship improvement projects net cruise cost per capacity day increased 28 25 on a constant currency basis due to higher marketing general and administrative expenses higher commissions and transportation fees and to a lesser extent higher maintenance and repairs including fuel and drydock expenses adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 29 26 on a constant currency basis we refer you to the “results of operations” above for a reconciliation of total cruise operating expense to adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel

 



 

 

interest expense net was 2704 million in 2018 compared to 2678 million in 2017 the increase in interest expense primarily reflects additional debt incurred in connection with the delivery of norwegian joy and norwegian bliss in the second quarter of 2017 and 2018 respectively project leonardo financing and higher interest rates due to an increase in libor the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the benefit from the october 2017 full redemption of our 4625 senior notes due 2020 and the benefit from the april 2018 partial 1350 million redemption of our 475 senior notes due 2021 2018 included 63 million of redemption premium and writeoff of fees in connection with the partial redemption 2017 included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of 239 million

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2018 our liquidity was 9089 million consisting of 1639 million in cash and cash equivalents and 7450 million available under our revolving loan facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

  

as of december 31 2018 we had a working capital deficit of 26 billion this deficit included 16 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our revolving loan facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

 

we evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity including the capital markets in the ordinary course of business we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure taking into consideration our current and expected capital requirements our assessment of prevailing market conditions and expectations regarding future conditions and the contractual and other restrictions to which we are subject

 

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions andor to pay dividends to nclc and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

 

in january 2019 we a reduced the pricing of our existing 8750 million revolving loan facility b reduced the pricing and increased the approximately 13 billion principal amount outstanding under the term loan a facility to 16 billion and c extended the maturity dates for our revolving loan facility and our term loan a facility to 2024 subject to certain conditions we used the proceeds from the increase in our term loan a facility to prepay all of the then outstanding amounts under the term loan b facility

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

in this section references to 2018 refer to the year ended december 31 2018 references to 2017 refer to the year ended december 31 2017 and references to 2016 refer to the year ended december 31 2016 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 21 billion in 2018 compared to 16 billion in 2017 and 13 billion in 2016 the net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 included net income of 9548 million an increase in advance ticket sales of 2626 million and timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities without the adoption of topic 606 advance ticket sales would have increased by 2506 million in 2018 we refer you to note 3— “revenue and expense from contracts with customers” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of topic 606 the change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 includes net income of 7599 million compared to net income of 6331 million in 2016 as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to various operating assets and liabilities including advance ticket sales of 1540 million in 2017 and 1350 million in 2016

net cash used in financing activities was 5848 million in 2018 reflecting the net repayment of our revolving loan facility repayments on other loan facilities the repurchase of nclh’s ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other partially offset by the proceeds from borrowings on newbuild loan facilities net cash used in financing activities was 1485 million in 2017 reflecting the repayment of our 4625 senior unsecured notes our net repayment of our revolving loan facility repayments on other loan facilities and deferred financing fees and other partially offset by the proceeds from our breakaway four loan facility net cash used in financing activities was 1228 million in 2016 reflecting the repayments of our 525 senior unsecured notes net repayments of our then existing revolving loan facility repayments on other loan facilities the repurchase of nlch’s ordinary shares and deferred financing fees and other partially offset by issuance of our 7000 million 4750 senior unsecured notes

  



 

 

future capital commitments 

  

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment projects as of december 31 2018 anticipated capital expenditures were 16 billion 12 billion and 07 billion for the years ending december 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively we have export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 06 billion 05 billion and 02 billion for the years ending december 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively these future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense as we take delivery of the ships

 

project leonardo will introduce an additional six ships each approximately 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027 subject to certain conditions we have a breakaway plus class ship norwegian encore with approximately 168000 gross tons with 4000 berths on order for delivery in the fall of 2019 for the regent brand we have orders for two explorer class ships seven seas splendor and an additional ship to be delivered in 2020 and 2023 respectively each of the explorer class ships will be approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths for the oceania cruises brand we have orders for two allura class ships to be delivered in 2022 and 2025 each of the allura class ships will be approximately 67000 gross tons and 1200 berths

 

the combined contract prices of the 11 ships on order for delivery was approximately €79 billion or 91 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2018 we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship subject to certain conditions we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations to occur however if any such events were to occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 was 304 million 290 million and 337 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

none

  

contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2018 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

 

  

 

   



 

  

other 

 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these transactions were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

  

funding sources 

 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio and maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2018

 

in addition our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor pay dividends to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to it to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

  

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our revolving loan facility and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next 12month period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

  

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2018 we had interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest expense by hedging the interest rate risks associated with variable rates on our outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2018 72 of our debt was fixed and 28 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of our outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was 10 billion as of december 31 2018 as of december 31 2017 54 of our debt was fixed and 46 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements was 2186 million as of december 31 2017 the change from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 was due to additional interest rate swaps executed and the repayment of variable rate debt

 

based on our december 31 2018 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 184 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

  



 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2018 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €22 billion or 25 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2018 as of december 31 2017 the payments not hedged aggregated €33 billion or 40 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2017 the change from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 was due to the delivery of a ship in april 2018 and additional foreign exchange derivatives executed we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2018 would result in a 03 billion change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

  

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 116 for the year ended december 31 2018 and 118 for each of the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2018 we had hedged approximately 57 53 and 33 of our 2019 2020 and 2021 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively as of december 31 2017 we had hedged approximately 65 48 and 26 of our 2018 2019 and 2020 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively the change in fuel price risk from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 was due to additional fuel hedges executed

 

we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2019 fuel expense by 405 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 201 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy

  

rich stateroom mix 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises and regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms suites and villas norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the studio lounge a private lounge area solely for studio guests as well as ocean views balconies and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites as well as three bedroom garden villas measuring up to 6694 square feet in addition nine of norwegian’s ships offer the haven a keycard access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations exclusive amenities and 247 butler and concierge service the haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool hot tubs sundeck fitness center and steam rooms onboard norwegian epic the breakaway class ships and the breakaway plus class ships the haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining restaurant

highquality service 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises and regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service we collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands norwegian offers guests the freedom and flexibility to design their ideal cruise vacation on their schedule with no set dining times a variety of entertainment options and no formal dress codes oceania cruises and regent are known for their quality of service including some of the highest crewtoguest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a country club casual setting

 

diverse selection of premium itineraries 

 

we have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries our fleet has a worldwide deployment offering a few days to 180day itineraries including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we introduced a new destination harvest caye in november 2016 this destination in southern belize features belize’s only cruise ship pier expansive seven acre white sand beach 15000 sq ft pool with swim up bar multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours

  

strong cash flow 

 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing in terms of newbuild capital expenditures the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025 subject to certain conditions

 



 

  

highly experienced management team 

 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries frank j del rio is our president and chief executive officer of nclh he has been successful in leading the integration of norwegian oceania cruises and regent brands prior to this he had been responsible for the financial and strategic development of prestige mr del rio founded oceania cruises in october 2002 and played a vital role in the development of renaissance cruises from 1993 to 2001 andrew stuart is our president and chief executive officer of our norwegian brand mr stuart joined norwegian in 1988 and has held several senior management positions in sales marketing and passenger services during his tenure before becoming president and chief executive officer robert binder is our vice chairman for the oceania cruises and regent brands and president and chief executive officer oceania cruises brand and jason m montague is our president and chief executive officer for the regent brand mr binder and mr montague were instrumental in launching oceania cruises in 2002 and are widely regarded as its cofounders robin lindsay is our executive vice president vessel operations for nclh since january 2015 mr lindsay was instrumental in the extensive refurbishment and launch of oceania cruises’ regatta insignia and nautica and the development of the marina and riviera for more on our senior management see “executive officers” below

  

our business strategies 

 

driving demand 

 

we seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several ways including

 

  

  

  

  

our markettofill strategy itinerary diversification marketing and sales force initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet our markettofill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and valueadded promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price

  

diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination management team which reviews deployments across the fleet either repositioning ships to new destinations or finetuning itineraries with the goal of creating product scarcity which in turn leads to higher pricing

  

we also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments our sales forces are also drivers of demand particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products and services in order for them to better sell to potential vacationers

  

lastly our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing brand awareness across the globe which allows us to diversify our guest sourcing we maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of north america including the united kingdom europe china australia brazil india japan and singapore 

  

leveraging scale to suppress costs 

  

we continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization this initiative is bolstered by our supply chain and logistics management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices

  

enhanced product offerings and guest experience 

  

norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea oceania cruises’ awardwinning onboard dining with multiple open seating dining venues is a central highlight of its cruise experience regent’s allinclusive offering includes air transportation shore excursions hotel packages specialty restaurants premium spirits and fine wines gratuities wifi and other amenities

  

maximize revenue 

  

we focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and occupancy percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue our specific initiatives include

 



 

 

strategic relationships we have strategic relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times

  

meetings incentives and charters we maintain our focus on the meetings incentives and charters channel which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction

  

promotional strategy with our norwegian brand we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice of one to five onboard amenities

  

casino player strategy we have nonexclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests these arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending

  

optimization of deployment we manage our ships’ deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance

  

ship refurbishments we have invested in revitalizations to our ships which provides a product which we believe delivers higher guest satisfaction and in turn higher pricing

  

disciplined fleet expansion 

  

we have norwegian bliss and norwegian encore on order for delivery in the spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019 respectively these ships will be the largest in our fleet each reaching approximately 164600 gross tons with approximately 3770 to 4000 berths each they will be similar in design to our first breakaway plus class ship norwegian escape which was delivered in october 2015 and will include additional innovative features we also have a contract to build a second explorer class ship seven seas splendor to be delivered in the winter of 2020 project leonardo consists of four ships on order with expected delivery dates through 2025 with an option for two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027 subject to certain conditions the four leonardo ships are each 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025 subject to certain conditions we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital

 

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations

 

we focus on distribution through our three primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters”

 

retailtravel agent the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe africa asia and australia we have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives we have expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training this education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings

 

international   the international channel represents an underpenetrated channel of distribution and one that we have increased focus on since 2015 focus on this market accomplishes the dual objective of allowing us to grow our yields and capacity faster than if we only focused on the north american market while also allowing us to diversify our risk as part of this focus we have undertaken a threepronged strategy of

    

as part of this strategy we have opened offices in sydney shanghai beijing hong kong mumbai tokyo and singapore and expanded or renovated our existing offices in southampton sao paulo and wiesbaden

 



 

 

for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks”

 

meetings incentives and charters this channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction the acquisition of sixthman in 2012 a company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters opened up a new market for travel partners enabling travel partners to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests

 

itineraries 

 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from a few days to 180days calling on worldwide locations including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the world

 

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on varied destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

 

for some of our longer itineraries we strive to maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last 7 to 20 days in order to capture more timeconstrained customers we believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises we have bolstered our presence internationally by opening sales offices in shanghai beijing hong kong sydney singapore tokyo and mumbai which will further increase sourcing from these markets for all three brands

 

in addition to expanding our international sourcing efforts we are in the process of deploying our vessels to new destinations around the world norwegian joy homeports yearround in the asia pacific region with itineraries that include many of the region’s ports

 

additionally all three of our brands sail to the republic of cuba these sailings began in the spring of 2017 and offer us travelers the opportunity to visit the culturally rich country on select caribbean sailings that include calls in the historic city of havana

 

passenger ticket revenue 

 

we offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities as well as meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation complimentary beverages unlimited shore excursions free internet precruise hotel packages and on some of the exotic itineraries pre or post land packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place

 

onboard and other revenue 

 

all three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare including casino operations certain food and beverage gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items food and beverage casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services may be managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities some internet services and various sports programs norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations food and beverage shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items to maximize onboard revenue norwegian uses various crossmarketing and promotional tools which are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services oceania cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities regent’s offerings typically include air transportation a precruise hotel night stay for concierge level and above premium wines and top shelf liquors gratuities and unlimited shore excursions both regent and oceania cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations gift shop purchases premium shore excursions and spa services

 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 31 30 and 28 of our consolidated revenue in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

 

revenue management practices 

 

our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing we concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields we execute targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering in both north american and select international markets to increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers this

 



 

 

marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns we believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

 

competition 

 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival corporation  carnival plc which owns and operates carnival cruise line holland america line princess cruises and seabourn cruise line among others and royal caribbean cruises ltd which owns and operates royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises among others as well as other cruise lines such as msc cruises crystal cruises silversea cruises and viking ocean cruises in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

 

sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions

 

marketing strategy 

 

our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales we utilize a multichannel strategy that may include a combination of print television radio websiteecommerce direct mail social media mobile and email campaigns partnerships customer loyalty initiatives market research and businesstobusiness events

 

building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us we have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise

 

travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts we provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other bestselling practices agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform

 

guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit information that helps shape future direction

 

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

 

ship maintenance and logistics 

 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel twice in 5 years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years depending age of vessel and flag state however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability

 

suppliers 

 



 

 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage advertising and marketing and travel agent services most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

 

crew and staff 

 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships

 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

 

prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits

 

we have developed safety management systems “sms” which establish policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms are approved and audited regularly by our classification society lloyds register and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annualsemiannual inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port and state authorities we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments

 

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

 

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

  

  

  

we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels

 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the imo diplomatic conference agreed

 



 

 

to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which took effect on april 23 2014 establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer in addition on december 31 2012 the european union “eu” passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident we believe the amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance however no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required

regulatory issues 

 

registration of our ships 

 

seventeen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship seven of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

 

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

 

environmental protection 

 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge water management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various air qualityrelated requirements

 

with regard to air quality requirements the international maritime organization’s “imo” convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” has set a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 05 reduced from the current 35 global limit beginning january 2020 alternative compliance methods such as the use of alternative fuels or sulfur scrubbers that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur emissions may also be utilized this fuel standard was initially set in 2008 and was reviewed in 2016 to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard the review took into account supply and demand in the global fuel oil market an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and other relevant issues the result of the review was to confirm the date of implementation as january 2020

 

marpol also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated emission control areas “ecas” which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel north american waters and the us caribbean sea ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around norway japan and the mediterranean sea being considered

 



 

 

ballast water discharges are governed by the marpol ballast water management convention which came into force in 2017 “the convention” and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization may contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different or potentially unsuitable environments

 

marpol also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage oil and sewage from ships including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage without causing delay to ships ships are generally required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks

 

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited stricter discharge restrictions will be in effect for new passenger ships in 2019 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2021

 

these requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

 

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federallyprotected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” program authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vesselspecific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

 

the act to prevent pollution from ships which implements the marpol in the us provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

 

the oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

 

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases the laws have no statutory limits of liability among the most stringent requirements are those set by the state of alaska which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

 

the european union “eu” has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at maintaining or improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

 

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the eu requires the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports passenger ships on regular service to eu ports and not operating in an eca are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 15 the eu has set january 2020 as the compliance date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit within their jurisdictional waters

 

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahamas ltd and ncl america llc are certified under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms

 

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations

 



 

 

cash flow or financial condition

 

permits for glacier bay alaska 

 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future

 

passenger wellbeing 

 

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the us food and drug administration “fda” we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

 

security and safety 

 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

 

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

 

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

 

maritimelabor 

 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” as amended establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

 

financial requirements 

 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 300 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments also our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the uk as of december 31 2017 approximately british pound sterling 118 million was in place as a security guarantee we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions

 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an

 



 

 

effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

 

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

 

taxation 

 

us income taxation 

 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

 

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

 

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq until december 18 2017 and have been primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” since december 19 2017 both the nasdaq and the nyse are considered to be established securities markets in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person other than the sponsors from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

 

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent pch and oceania cruises is treated as a corporation for 2015 2016 and 2017 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above

 

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

 

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

 



 

 

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate 21 rate effective january 1 2018 and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

 

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

  

other united states taxation 

 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

  

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

 

uk income taxation 

 

as a result of a restructuring nclh and nclc became tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

 

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

 

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

changes in tax laws 

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” was enacted on december 22 2017 among other provisions the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the act the measurement period ends when a company has obtained prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting but cannot extend beyond one year as of december 31 2017 we have not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act however as described below we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances these amounts are provisional and subject to change the most significant impact of the act for the company was a 74 million reduction of the value of net deferred tax liabilities which represent future tax expenses that was recorded as a discrete tax benefit as a result of lowering the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the tax benefit represents a provisional amount and the company’s current best estimate any adjustments recorded to the provisional amount through the end of 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense the provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the company’s current

 



 

 

interpretation of the act and may change as the company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance other aspects of the act are either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2017 we employed approximately 3000 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 28000 shipboard employees regent and oceania cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

 

ports and facilities 

  

we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on certain itineraries we have also developed a cruise destination in belize harvest caye which we introduced in november 2016 in addition we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our ships which include the following

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

segment reporting 

 

we have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment each brand norwegian oceania cruises and regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics including similar longterm margins and similar products and services therefore we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment

 

although we sell cruises on an international basis our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to ussourced guests who make reservations in the us revenue attributable to ussourced guests was 77 81 and 75 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively no other individual country’s revenues exceeded 10 in any of our last three years

 

revenues by destination were as follows in thousands

 

  

substantially all of our long–lived assets are located outside of the us and consist primarily of our ships we have 17 ships with bahamas registry with a carrying value of 80 billion as of december 31 2017 and 16 ships with bahamas registry with a carrying value of 71 billion as of december 31 2016 we have seven ships with marshall island registry with a carrying value of 19 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we also have one ship with us registry with a carrying value of 03 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

  



 

  

risks related to the company 

  

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

  

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes floods and typhoons fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor expenditures

  

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

 

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected

  

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets in the asia pacific region and to expand our itineraries in new markets such as cuba and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union the proposed withdrawal resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and caused severe fluctuations in global currency exchange rates the proposed withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union further uncertainty around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks while we have and continue to invest in business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security we cannot completely insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

 

we have also made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation if our security systems were breached we could be exposed to cyberrelated risks and malware and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk for example in the processing of our guest transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information including email addresses and home addresses and financial data such as credit card information the security of the systems and network where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business and these systems and our network may be vulnerable to computer viruses hackers and other security issues we cannot assure you that the precautions we have taken to avoid an unauthorized incursion of our information systems are either adequate or implemented properly to prevent a data breach and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business in addition we may not be in a position to promptly address attacks or unauthorized access or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such attacks we are also subject to laws relating to privacy of personal data including european union data privacy regulations the compromise of our information systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests or employees could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment

 



 

 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems or a denial of service attack we may incur costs associated with the following response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement data restoration regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees damages and settlements in addition data security breaches or denial of service attacks may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

  

changes in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices 

 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to or may enter into in the future increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

 

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and may add up to nine additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations additionally older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices

 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes floods typhoons and earthquakes financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies any limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 



 

 

our indebtedness and the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in operating our business 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs in addition a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business the economy and the industry in which we operate we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness which may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

  

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

  

  

  

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

  

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

 



 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

 

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business

 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

 

delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs maintenance and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could

 



 

 

adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

currently we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements four of these agreements are in effect through 2018 and four through 2020 any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

 

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

 

the majority of our guests book their cruises through independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators in the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic downturn or by other factors this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 

additionally independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators generally sell and market our cruises on a nonexclusive basis although we offer commissions and other incentives to them for booking our cruises there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in the future travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors particularly in the north american market to sell and market our competitors’ cruises exclusively if such exclusive arrangements were introduced there can be no assurances that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected

 

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

 

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train

 



 

 

our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

 

our revenue is seasonal owing to variations in passenger fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year we may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses during certain periods of the year 

 

the demand for our cruises is seasonal with the greatest demand for cruises generally occurring during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for drydocks which we typically schedule during offpeak demand periods for such ships accordingly seasonality in demand and drydock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during certain periods of the year

  

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

  

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

  

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

 

increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual countries and us states are considering as well as implementing new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol an international environmental regulation and

 



 

 

stcw and its requirements for ship manning in addition some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact

 

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations

 

among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot measure approved by alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” the law was relaxed somewhat in 2013 allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits an option that may ease compliance with certain wqs the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 the convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special ecas with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning aboard ships ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands and waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels or installation of sulfur scrubbing technologies

 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues”

 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

financial presentation 

 

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months

 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services photo services as well as certain bareboat charter revenue we also record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies

 

ship accounting 

 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

 



 

 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2017 would have increased by 122 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 594 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

 

asset impairment 

 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available utilizing estimates judgments and projections as necessary our estimate of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the associated risk

 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in order to make this evaluation we consider whether any of the following factors or conditions exist

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships goodwill tradenames and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge if a material change occurred we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step i test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units

  

for our annual impairment evaluation we performed a step 0 test for the norwegian regent seven seas and oceania cruises reporting units as of december 31 2017 there was 5230 million 4621 million and 4038 million of goodwill for the oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian reporting units respectively as of december 31 2017 our annual review consisting of the step 0 test supports the carrying value of these assets

 



 

 

contingencies 

 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue adjusted net revenue net yield adjusted net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

 

in addition adjusted net revenue and adjusted net yield which exclude certain business combination accounting entries are nongaap financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net revenue adjusted net yield adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2016 we incurred a writeoff of 112 million of deferred financing fees due to the refinancing of certain credit facilities a similar writeoff was not incurred in either of the years ended december 31 2017 or december 31 2015 we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since this amount was not representative of our daytoday operations and we have included similar nonrepresentative adjustments in prior periods

 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2017 our liquidity was 9732 million consisting of 1762 million in cash and cash equivalents and 7970 million available under our new revolving loan facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

  

as of december 31 2017 we had a working capital deficit of 20 billion this deficit included 13 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our new revolving loan facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

 

we evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity including the capital markets in the ordinary course of business we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure taking into consideration our current and expected capital requirements our assessment of prevailing market conditions and expectations regarding future conditions and the contractual and other restrictions to which we are subject

 



 

 

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions andor to pay dividends to nclc and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders nclh is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

future capital commitments 

  

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment projects as of december 31 2017 anticipated capital expenditures were 15 billion 13 billion and 08 billion for the years ending december 31 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively we have export credit financing in place for the anticipated expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 08 billion 06 billion and 05 billion for the years ended december 31 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively these future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense as we take delivery of the ships

 

project leonardo will introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025 we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027 subject to certain conditions these four project leonardo ships are each approximately 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths we have an explorer class ship seven seas splendor on order for delivery in the winter of 2020 this ship is approximately 55000 gross tons and 750 berths we have two breakaway plus class ships norwegian bliss and norwegian encore on order for delivery in the spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 respectively these ships are approximately 168000 gross tons each with approximately 4000 berths each the combined contract price of these seven ships was approximately €55 billion or 66 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2017 we have obtained export credit financing for the ships which is expected to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025 subject to certain conditions for ships expected to be delivered after 2023 the contract prices are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances

 

in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 was 290 million 337 million and 319 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

 



 

  

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

none

  

contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2017 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

 

  

 

  

the table above does not include 05 million of unrecognized tax benefits we refer you to the notes to the consolidated financial statements note—10 “income tax”

  

other 

 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these transactions were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

 

funding sources 

 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2017

 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our new revolving loan facility and our ability to issue debt securities or additional equity securities will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

 



 

  




 item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

 

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

  

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2017 we had interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2017 54 of our debt was fixed and 46 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2017 was 2186 million based on our december 31 2017 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 294 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2017 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €33 billion or 40 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2017 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2017 would result in a 04 billion change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

  

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 118 for each of the twelve months ended december 31 2017 and 2016 and 135 for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2017 we had hedged approximately 65 48 and 26 of our 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively projected metric tons of fuel purchases we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2018 fuel expense by 380 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 206 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

history and development of the company 

 

nclh is a leading global cruise company which operates the norwegian cruise line oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises brands we have 24 ships with approximately 46500 berths and plan to introduce eight additional ships through 2025 with an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027

 

norwegian commenced operations from miami in 1966 in february 2000 genting hk acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the norwegian operations

 

in january 2008 the apollo holders acquired 50 of the outstanding ordinary share capital of nclc as part of this investment the apollo holders assumed control of nclc’s board of directors also in january 2008 the tpg viking funds acquired in the aggregate 125 of nclc’s outstanding share capital from the apollo holders

 

in january 2013 nclh completed its ipo pursuant to which it sold 27058824 ordinary shares for net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of approximately 4739 million

 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of prestige we believe that the combination of norwegian and prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market presence

 

the sponsors have completed numerous secondary equity offerings and as of december 31 2016 have reduced their ownership to 294 of nclh’s ordinary shares

  

corporate reorganization 

 

in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 001 per share in connection with the consummation of the ipo the sponsors’ ordinary shares in nclc were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” at the same time nclh contributed 4600 million to nclc and the historical financial statements of nclc became those of nclh the corporate reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure nclh had not prior to the completion of the corporate reorganization conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the corporate reorganization and the ipo

 

nclc was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the terms of the partnership including the economic rights with respect thereto were set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for nclc economic interests in nclc were represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement which we refer to as “ncl corporation units”

 

in connection with the corporate reorganization nclc’s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management or former management of nclc were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of ncl corporation units we refer to the ncl corporation units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as management ncl corporation units as a result of the corporate reorganization the management ncl corporation units created a noncontrolling interest within nclh the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests were subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged the management ncl corporation units issued in exchange for the profits interests represented a 27 economic interest in nclc as of the consummation of the ipo

 

subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units had the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for ordinary shares of nclh at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events

 

when a holder of a management ncl corporation unit exchanged such unit for one of nclh’s ordinary shares or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares the relative economic interests of the exchanging ncl corporation unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of nclh were not altered as a result of the corporate reorganization a noncontrolling interest was created within nclh and nclh’s financial statements and financial results differed from nclc’s in certain respects

 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 all management ncl corporation units were exchanged for nclh ordinary shares and restricted shares nclh became the sole member and 100 owner of the economic interests in nclc and the noncontrolling interest no longer exists accordingly nclc is now treated as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes no new nclc profits

 





 

interests or management ncl corporation units will be issued however nclh has granted and expects to continue to grant equity to its employees and members of its board of directors under its longterm incentive plan

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy

  

rich stateroom mix 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises and regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms suites and villas norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the studio lounge a private lounge area solely for studio guests as well as ocean views balconies and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites as well as three bedroom garden villas measuring up to 6694 square feet in addition eight of norwegian’s ships offer the haven a keycard access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations exclusive amenities and 247 butler and concierge service the haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool hot tubs sundeck fitness center and steam rooms onboard norwegian epic and breakaway class ships the haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining restaurant norwegian escape the newest and first

highquality service 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises and regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service we collaborate amongst the brands to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands norwegian offers freestyle cruising with numerous dining venues oceania cruises and regent are known for their quality of service including some of the highest crewtoguest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a country club casual setting

 

diverse selection of premium itineraries 

 

we have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries our fleet has a worldwide deployment offering one to 180day itineraries including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we introduced a new destination harvest caye in november 2016 this destination in southern belize features belize’s only cruise ship pier expansive seven acre white sand beach 15000 sq ft pool with swim up bar multiple dining options and a nature center with wildlife experiences plus adventure tours

  

strong cash flow 

 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing in terms of newbuild capital expenditures the cash flow impact is mitigated by export credit financing for all newbuild ships expected to be delivered through 2025 to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship

our business strategies 

 

driving demand 

 

we seek to attract vacationers to our products and services in several ways including

 

  

  

  

  





 

our markettofill strategy itinerary diversification marketing and sales force initiatives and international expansion strategies contribute to driving increased revenues for our fleet our markettofill strategy maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and valueadded promotions when necessary to mitigate the need to compromise on price

 

diversification of deployment is achieved by our destination management team which reviews deployments across the fleet either repositioning ships to new destinations or finetuning itineraries with the goal of creating scarcity which in turn leads to higher pricing

 

we also seek to increase demand through effective marketing campaigns across various channels such as branding campaigns on nationwide television or targeted mail campaigns aimed at supporting seasonal deployments our sales forces are also drivers of demand particularly in terms of educating travel agents on our products and services in order for them to better sell to potential vacationers

 

lastly our international expansion efforts are aimed at increasing brand awareness across the globe we maintain numerous sales offices which support sales and marketing efforts in various markets outside of north america including the united kingdom europe china australia brazil india japan and singapore we are also growing our deployment footprint by positioning our upcoming ship norwegian joy to sail year round voyages from china in a product designed for chinese guests

  

leveraging scale to suppress costs 

 

we continue to leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization this initiative is bolstered by our supply chain and logistics management function which supports our three brands as well as our corporate and international offices

 

enhanced product offerings and guest experience 

  

norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea oceania cruises’ awardwinning onboard dining with multiple open seating dining venues is a central highlight of its cruise experience regent’s allinclusive offering includes air transportation shore excursions hotel packages specialty restaurants premium spirits and fine wines gratuities wifi and other amenities

  

maximize revenue 

 

we focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and occupancy percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall revenue our specific initiatives include

 

strategic relationships we have strategic relationships with travel agencies and tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times

  

meetings incentives and charters we maintain our focus on the meetings incentives and charters channel which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction

  

promotional strategy with our norwegian brand we utilize a more inclusive product offering on certain sailings and in certain cabin selections which provides guests a choice of one to five onboard amenities

  

casino player strategy we have nonexclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests these arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests expected to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending

 

optimization of deployment we manage our ships’ deployment to promote better breadth of itineraries and to offer sailings further in advance

  

disciplined fleet expansion 

 

we have norwegian joy norwegian bliss and one additional breakaway plus class ship on order for delivery in the spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019 respectively these ships will be the largest in our fleet each reaching approximately 164600 gross tons with approximately 3770 to 4000 berths each they will be similar in design to our first breakaway plus class ship norwegian escape which was delivered in october 2015 and will include additional innovative features we also have a contract to build a second explorer class ship to be delivered in the winter of 2020 project leonardo consists of four ships on order with

 





 

expected delivery dates through 2025 with an option for two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027 subject to certain conditions these four ships are each 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths we have obtained export credit financing for the ships to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025 subject to certain conditions we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital

  

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments through which travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations

 

we focus on distribution through our three primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters”

  

retailtravel agent the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe africa asia and australia we have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives we have expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training this education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings

  

international we continue to accelerate our international expansion efforts building on initiatives rolled out in 2015 that focused on increasing our presence in the fast growing asia pacific region we announced the redeployment of norwegian star and later norwegian jewel to the australasia region along with the opening of our sales office in sydney australia which services the growing demand from the asia pacific region for cruises across our three brands

 

our entry into the chinese market includes a multipronged strategy to expand our presence in what we believe is positioned to become the world’s second largest cruise market we began with the opening of sales and marketing offices in shanghai beijing and hong kong that will serve dual purposes these offices will look to source chinese guests for international cruises across our three brands which together combine to form a broad portfolio of voyages and itineraries to every corner of the globe that a chinese cruiser would look to sail these offices will support our travel partners to source locally for our chinadedicated venture norwegian joy being launched in the spring of 2017 which will be purposebuilt for chinese consumers the ship will be designed to deliver a blend of the norwegian brand’s offering of freedom and flexibility with amenities and features that will resonate with chinese guests

 

for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks”

  

meetings incentives and charters this channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction the acquisition of sixthman in 2012 a company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters opened up a new market for travel partners enabling travel partners to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests

  

itineraries 

 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from one to 180days calling on worldwide locations including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the americas and europe

 

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on varied destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

 

for some of our longer itineraries we strive to maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last 7 to 20 days in order to capture more timeconstrained customers we believe the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises

 





 

we have bolstered our presence internationally by opening sales offices in shanghai beijing hong kong sydney singapore tokyo and mumbai which will further increase sourcing from these source markets for all three brands

 

in addition to expanding our international sourcing efforts we are in the process of deploying our vessels to new destinations around the world norwegian star and norwegian jewel will homeport yearround in the asia pacific region with itineraries that include many of the region’s ports

 

additionally all three of our brands have received approval from the government of the republic of cuba to operate cruises to the island beginning in 2017 these historic sailings will begin in march 2017 and offer us travelers the opportunity to visit the culturally and historically rich country on select caribbean sailings that include calls in the historic city of havana through december 2017

  

passenger ticket revenue 

 

we offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities including meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation complimentary beverages unlimited shore excursions and precruise hotel packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place

  

onboard and other revenue 

 

all three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare including casino operations certain food and beverage gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items food and beverage casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops spa services art auctions and some internet services may be managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations food and beverage shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items to maximize onboard revenue norwegian uses various crossmarketing and promotional tools which are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services oceania cruises’ offerings may include air transportation and certain other amenities regent’s offerings typically include air transportation a precruise hotel night stay for concierge level and above premium wines and top shelf liquors gratuities and unlimited shore excursions both regent and oceania cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations gift shop purchases premium shore excursions and spa services

 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 30 28 and 30 of our consolidated revenue in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

  

revenue management practices 

 

our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing we concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields we execute targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering in both north american and select international markets to increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers this marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns we believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

  

competition 

 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival corporation  carnival plc which owns and operates carnival cruise line holland america line princess cruises and seabourn cruise line among others and royal caribbean cruises ltd which

 





 

owns and operates royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises among others as well as other cruise lines such as crystal cruises silversea cruises and viking ocean cruises in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

 

sales of cruises and onboard offerings are subject to consumer discretionary spending levels and may be influenced by geopolitical events and economic conditions generally

  

marketing strategy 

 

our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales we utilize a multichannel strategy that may include a combination of print television radio websiteecommerce direct mail social media mobile and email campaigns partnerships customer loyalty initiatives market research and businesstobusiness events

 

building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us we have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise

 

travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts we provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other bestselling practices agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform

 

guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit information that helps shape future direction

  

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

  

ship maintenance and logistics 

  

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel twice in 5 years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years depending age of vessel and flag state however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability

  

suppliers 

 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage advertising and marketing and travel agent services most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

 

crew and staff 

 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

 





 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships

 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

 

prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits

 

we have developed safety management systems “sms” which establish policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms are approved and audited regularly by our classification society lloyds register and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annualsemiannual inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port and state authorities we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments

  

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

 

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

  

  

  

we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels

 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the imo diplomatic conference agreed to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which took effect on april 23 2014 establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer in addition on december 31 2012 the european union “eu” passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident we believe the amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance however no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required

 

trademarks 

 

under the norwegian brand we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” “feel free” “cruise like a norwegian” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the

 





 

“freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” we believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout north america europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value

 

under the oceania cruises brand we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “oceania cruises” and its logo “regatta” “insignia” and “your world your way”

 

under the regent brand we own registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “seven seas cruises” those of our ships and “luxury goes exploring” we also claim common law rights in trade names used in conjunction with our ships incentive programs customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships

 

the regent ships have been operating under the regent brand since 2006 we entered into a trademark license agreement with regent hospitality worldwide inc which we amended in february 2011 granting us the right to use the “regent” brand family of marks the amended trademark license agreement allows regent to use the regent trade name in conjunction with cruises in perpetuity subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement

  

regulatory issues 

  

registration of our ships 

 

sixteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship seven of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

 

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

  

environmental protection 

 

our ships are subject to various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those that govern air emissions waste discharge water management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways and we must adhere to various air qualityrelated requirements

 

the international maritime organization’s convention entitled prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” specifies requirements for emission control areas “ecas” with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas ships operating in the baltic sea eca the north seaenglish channel eca the north american eca and the us caribbean sea eca are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods other additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around australia hong kong japan the mediterranean sea and mexico being considered

 

the marpol global limit on fuel sulfur content established by the imo when vessels are outside of ecas will be reduced to 05 from the current 35 global limit beginning january 2020 the 05 global limit was reviewed to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard this review took into account supply and demand in the global fuel oil market an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and other relevant issues the result of the review was to confirm the date of implementation as january 2020 the european union parliament and council has set january 2020 as the final date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit to enter force prior to the imo review

 

starting september 8 2017 the marpol ballast water management convention “the convention” will govern the discharge of ballast water from ships ballast water which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization can contain a variety of marine species the convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new different or potentially unsuitable environments

 

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited stricter discharge restrictions are currently in effect for new passenger ships whose construction began after january 1 2016 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2018 the underlying requirements may impact our operations unless

 





 

suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time

 

in the us the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the environmental protection agency “epa” with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is on inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federally protected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” authorized by the clean water act was established to reduce pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the npdes requirements are set forth in the epa’s vessel general permit “vgp” the vgp establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

 

the us act to prevent pollution from ships which implements the marpol provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

 

the us oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship that operates in these waters our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance

 

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability the state of alaska enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

 

the european union “eu” has adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections

 

with regard to air emissions from seagoing ships the european commission’s “ec” strategy is to require the use of low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports passenger ships on regular service to eu ports are required to use fuels containing a maximum sulfur content of 15

 

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahamas ltd and ncl america llc are certified under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms

 

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

 

permits for glacier bay alaska 

 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future

 

passenger wellbeing 

  

in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the us food and drug administration “fda” we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the

 





 

us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to us ports

 

security and safety 

 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of the solas convention which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

 

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” all of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

 

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies

 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us while docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a us requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

 

maritimelabor 

 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” as amended establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

 

financial requirements 

 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 300 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments also our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the uk as of december 31 2016 approximately british pound sterling 105 million was in place as a security guarantee we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions

 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

 

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

 





  

taxation 

  

us income taxation 

 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

  

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

 

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq global select market which is considered to be an established securities market in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person other than the sponsors from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

 

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent pch and oceania cruises is treated as a corporation for 2015 and 2016 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above for 2014 both regent and oceania cruises relied on pch’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 pch is organized as a company in panama which grants an equivalent tax exemption to us corporations and is thus classified as a qualified foreign country for purposes of section 883 pch was classified as a cfc for the taxable year ended december 31 2014 and we believe pch met the ownership and substantiation requirements of the cfc test under the regulations for that year

  

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our us sourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

 

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

 

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is

 





 

considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

 

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

  

other united states taxation 

 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

  

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america 

 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

  

uk income taxation 

 

as a result of a restructuring nclh and nclc became tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

  

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

  

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

  

changes in tax laws 

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

  

employees 

 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 3000 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 27000 shipboard employees regent and oceania cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

 

ports and facilities 

  

we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on certain itineraries we have also developed a cruise destination in belize harvest caye which we introduced in november 2016 in addition we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our ships which include the following

 

  





 

        

segment reporting 

 

we have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment each brand norwegian oceania cruises and regent constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics including similar longterm margins and similar products and services therefore we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment

 

although we sell cruises on an international basis our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to ussourced guests who make reservations in the us revenue attributable to ussourced guests was 81 75  and 73 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively no other individual country’s revenues exceeded 10 in any of our last three years

 

revenues by destination were as follows in thousands

 

  

substantially all of our long–lived assets are located outside of the us and consist primarily of our ships we have 16 ships with bahamas registry with a carrying value of 71 billion and 72 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we have seven ships with marshall island registry with a carrying value of 19 billion as of december 31 2016 and six ships with marshall island registry with a carrying value of 14 billion as of december 31 2015 we also have one ship with us registry with a carrying value of 03 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forward–looking statements” 

  

risks related to the company 

  

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

  

terrorist acts armed conflict and threats thereof acts of piracy and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility or fear of such events political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories or elevated national threat warnings by national governments

 





 

an increase in the activity of pirates and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers restrictions on repatriation of earnings withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

 

we have operations in and source passengers from the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union the proposed withdrawal has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets and caused severe volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies such as the euro in which we do business the proposed withdrawal could potentially adversely affect tax legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union further uncertainty around these issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets in the asia pacific region and to expand our itineraries into new markets such as cuba and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

  

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks while we have and continue to invest in business continuity disaster recovery data restoration plans and data and information technology security we cannot completely insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

 

we have also made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation if our security systems were breached we could be exposed to cyberrelated risks and malware and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk for example in the processing of our guest transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations we and certain of our thirdparty service providers collect process transmit and store a large volume of

 





 

personally identifiable information including email addresses and home addresses and financial data such as credit card information the security of the systems and network where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business and these systems and our network may be vulnerable to computer viruses hackers and other security issues we cannot assure you that the precautions we have taken to avoid an unauthorized incursion of our information systems are either adequate or implemented properly to prevent a data breach and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business we are also subject to laws relating to privacy of personal data the compromise of our information systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests prospective guests or employees could result in governmental investigation civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business additionally any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment

 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems we may incur costs associated with the following breach response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees and damages denial of service attacks may result in costs associated with among other things the following response forensics public relations consultants data restoration legal fees and settlement in addition data security breaches or denial of service attacks may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results

  

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected

  

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor expenditures

  

changes in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations 

 

fuel expense is a significant cost for our company future increases in the cost of fuel globally or regulatory requirements which require us to use more expensive types of fuel would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to or may enter into in the future increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests

 

an impairment of our tradenames or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

 

we evaluate tradenames and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable several factors including a challenging operating environment impacts affecting consumer demand or spending the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses

 





 

may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s tradename or goodwill which could adversely impact our results of operations

 

our hedging strategies may not be costeffective or adequately protect us from increased costs related to changes in fuel prices 

 

in order to manage risks associated with the variable market prices of fuel we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements however our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments 

 

our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations prospects and flexibility our substantial indebtedness could

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we also may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness at any time in the future although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness including refinancing our indebtedness that may not be successful any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations

 





  

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

  

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

  

  

  

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness

 

if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

  

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

  





  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

 

overcapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and may add up to ten additional ships to our fleet through 2027 our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets these increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations

 

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business

 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

  

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

 

the majority of our guests book their cruises through independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators in the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic downturn or by other factors this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 

additionally independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators generally sell and market our cruises on a nonexclusive basis although we offer commissions and other incentives to them for booking our cruises there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in the future travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors particularly in the north american market to sell and market our competitors’ cruises exclusively if such exclusive arrangements were introduced there can be no assurances that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected

  

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

  

delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs maintenance and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our cruise ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to

 





 

the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for refurbishment and repairs due to reduced competition also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

  

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our cruise ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

  

our revenue is seasonal owing to variations in passenger fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year we may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses during certain periods of the year 

 

the demand for our cruises is seasonal with the greatest demand for cruises generally occurring during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for drydocks which we typically schedule during offpeak demand periods for such ships accordingly seasonality in demand and drydock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during certain periods of the year

  

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

  

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

currently we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements three of these agreements are in effect through 2017 and four through 2018 the remaining one is set to expire in 2020 any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies any limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

  





  

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

  

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

  

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

  

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

 

some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual countries and us states are considering as well as implementing new laws

 





 

and rules to manage cruise ship operations and waste in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol an international environmental regulation and stcw and its conventions in ship manning

 

the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies including those aimed at reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases and improving sewage and greywaterhandling capabilities compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations

 

among the laws impacting cruise ship operations are a 2006 ballot measure approved by alaskan voters requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” the law was relaxed in 2013 allowing ship operators to apply for mixing zones in discharge permits an option that may ease compliance with certain wqs and reducing the need to remove ammonia copper zinc and nickel from wastewater the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 the convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special ecas with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands have been included as of january 2014 are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels

 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues”

 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

 

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

  

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as shareholders of a us corporation 

 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

  

nclh does not have current plans to pay dividends on its ordinary shares 

 

nclh does not currently intend to pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

  





  

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include subject to the shareholders’ agreement

 

  

  

  

  

  

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties other than the apollo holders the tpg viking funds and genting hk from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions as well as the significant ownership of ordinary shares by our sponsors may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

in the normal course of our business various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount

  

nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery however based on our current knowledge we do not believe that the aggregate amount or range of reasonably possible losses with respect to these matters will be material to our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

financial presentation 

 

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months

 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services photo services as well as certain bareboat charter revenue we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies

 

ship accounting 

 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

 





 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2016 would have increased by 112 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 622 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

  

asset impairment 

 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates judgments and projections considered necessary the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved

 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable for our evaluation of goodwill and tradenames we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in order to make this evaluation we consider the following circumstances

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge if a material change occurred we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step i test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units

 

in the third quarter of 2016 based on the performance of the oceania cruises reporting unit we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation consisting of a step i test based on that evaluation we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill because its fair value exceeded its carrying value for our annual impairment evaluation we performed a step 0 test for the norwegian reporting unit and step i tests for the regent seven seas and the oceania cruises reporting units based on those evaluations we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value however if the fair value of any reporting unit declines in future periods its goodwill may become impaired at that time as of december 31 2016 there was 5230 million 4621 million and 4038 million of goodwill for the oceania cruises regent seven seas and norwegian reporting units respectively as of december 31 2016 our annual review consisting of the step 0 and step i tests supports the carrying value of these assets

 





  

contingencies 

 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

  

nongaap financial measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue adjusted net revenue net yield adjusted net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance

 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

 

in addition adjusted net revenue and adjusted net yield which exclude certain business combination accounting entries are nongaap financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance in addition management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net revenue adjusted net yield adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results for example for the year ended december 31 2016 we incurred 280 million of amounts related to the extinguishment of debt and 112 million of deferred financing fees due to the refinancing of certain credit facilities we included these as adjustments in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since these amounts are not representative of our daytoday operations and we have included similar adjustments in prior periods

 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

 

as of december 31 2016 our liquidity was 7493 million consisting of 1283 million in cash and cash equivalents and 6210 million available under our new revolving loan facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

 

as of december 31 2016 we had a working capital deficit of 19 billion this deficit included 12 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our new revolving loan facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

 

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor to pay dividends to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

future capital commitments 

  

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as well as our ship refurbishment projects as of december 31 2016 anticipated capital

 





 

expenditures were 13 billion for each of the years ending december 31 2017 and 2018 and 12 billion for 2019 we have export credit financing in place for the expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 08 billion for 2017 07 billion for 2018 and 06 billion for 2019 these future expected capital expenditures will significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense

 

we have norwegian joy norwegian bliss and one additional breakaway plus class ship on order for delivery in the spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019 respectively these ships will be amongst the largest in our fleet each reaching approximately 164600 gross tons the combined contract price of these three ships is approximately €26 billion or 27 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2016 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of their contract prices we have an explorer class ship on order with an original contract price of approximately €4220 million or approximately 4438 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2016 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of the contract price the explorer class ship is expected to be delivered in the winter of 2020

 

in february 2017 we announced that we plan to introduce an additional four ships with expected delivery dates through 2025 and we have an option to introduce two additional ships for delivery in 2026 and 2027 subject to certain conditions these four ships are each 140000 gross tons with approximately 3300 berths the contract price for each of the four ships is approximately €8000 million subject to certain conditions or 8414 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31 2016 we have obtained export credit financing for the four ships to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship expected to be delivered through 2025 subject to certain conditions

 

in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 337 million 319 million and 220 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

none

  

contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2016 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

 

  

 

  

the table above does not include the ships on order after december 31 2016 as part of project leonardo

the table above does not include 111 million of unrecognized tax benefits we refer you to the notes to the consolidated financial statements note—11 “income tax”

  





  

other 

 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

 

funding sources 

 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends substantially all of our ships and other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for certain of our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2016

 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets can create a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional equity will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

  




 item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

  

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the notional term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

  

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2016 we had interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2016 550 of our debt was fixed and 450 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2016 was 3085 million based on our december 31 2016 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 291 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2016 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €1469 million or 1545 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2016 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2016 would result in a 155 million change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

  

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 118 135 and 168 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2016 we had hedged approximately 78 66 48 and 18 of our 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2017 fuel expense by 285 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 178 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

norwegian commenced operations from miami in 1966 in february 2000 genting hk acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the norwegian operations

 

in january 2008 the apollo holders acquired 50 of the outstanding ordinary share capital of nclc as part of this investment the apollo holders assumed control of nclc’s board of directors also in january 2008 the tpg viking funds acquired in the aggregate 125 of nclc’s outstanding share capital from the apollo holders

 

in january 2013 nclh completed its ipo pursuant to which it sold 27058824 ordinary shares for net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of approximately 4739 million

 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of prestige we believe that the combination of norwegian and prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market presence

 

the sponsors have completed numerous secondary equity offerings and as of december 31 2015 owned 293 of nclh’s ordinary shares

  

corporate reorganization 

 

in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 001 per share in connection with the consummation of the ipo the sponsors’ ordinary shares in nclc were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” at the same time nclh contributed 4600 million to nclc and the historical financial statements of nclc became those of nclh the corporate reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure nclh had not prior to the completion of the corporate reorganization conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the corporate reorganization and the ipo

 

nclc was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the terms of the partnership including the economic rights with respect thereto were set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for nclc economic interests in nclc were represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement which we refer to as “ncl corporation units”

 

in connection with the corporate reorganization nclc’s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management or former management of nclc were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of ncl corporation units we refer to the ncl corporation units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as management ncl corporation units as a result of the corporate reorganization the management ncl corporation units created a noncontrolling interest within nclh the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests were subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged the management ncl corporation units issued in exchange for the profits interests represented a 27 economic interest in nclc as of the consummation of the ipo

 

subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units had the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for ordinary shares of nclh at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events

 

when a holder of a management ncl corporation unit exchanged such unit for one of nclh’s ordinary shares or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares the relative economic interests of the exchanging ncl corporation unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of nclh were not altered as a result of the corporate reorganization a noncontrolling interest was created within nclh and nclh’s financial statements and financial results differed from nclc’s in certain respects

 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 all management ncl corporation units were exchanged for nclh ordinary shares and restricted shares nclh became the sole member and 100 owner of the economic interests in nclc and the noncontrolling interest no longer exists accordingly nclc is now treated as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes no new nclc profits interests or management ncl corporation units will be issued however nclh has granted and expects to continue to grant equity to its employees and members of its board of directors under its longterm incentive plan

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy

  

rich stateroom mix 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises’ and regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms suites and villas norwegian’s accommodations include the groundbreaking studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the studio lounge a private lounge area solely for studio guests as well as ocean views balconies and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers norwegian’s suites range from two bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites as well as three bedroom garden villas measuring up to 6694 square feet in addition eight of norwegian’s ships offer the haven a keycard access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations exclusive amenities and 247 butler and concierge service the haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool hot tubs sundeck fitness center and steam rooms onboard norwegian epic and breakaway class ships the haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining restaurant norwegian escape the newest and first of the breakaway plus class ships offers the largest haven complex to date with new outdoor fine dining providing expansive ocean views the spacious and elegant accommodations on oceania cruises’ five awardwinning ships the 684berth regatta insignia and nautica and the 1250berth marina and riviera range from 160square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2030square foot owner’s suites oceania cruises will add a fourth 684berth ship with sirena being placed in service in the spring of 2016 the regent fleet is comprised of three ships seven seas voyager and seven seas mariner which feature allsuite allbalcony accommodations and seven seas navigator with a majority of accommodations including balconies regent’s seven seas explorer to be delivered in the summer of 2016 will also feature allsuite allbalcony accommodations including sophisticated designer suites ranging from 300 to 3875 square feet which are amongst the highest spacetoguest and crewtoguest ratios in the industry

  

highquality service 

 

the norwegian oceania cruises and regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service norwegian continues to enhance the level of service on its ships through the recently launched “the norwegian edge” program this program introduces specific standards aimed at enhancing the overall guest experience which we believe will promote further customer loyalty we believe the acquisition of prestige allows for collaboration among the norwegian oceania cruises and regent brands which will facilitate our ability to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands oceania cruises and regent are known for their quality of service including some of the highest crewtoguest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a country club casual setting

  



 

  

diverse selection of premium itineraries 

 

we have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries our fleet has a worldwide deployment offering one to 180 days itineraries to more than 510 ports including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean

  

strong cash flow 

 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility all three of our brands afford the ability to presell tickets receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing in terms of newbuild capital expenditures the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have export credit financing in place for all newbuild ships to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship

  

highly experienced management team 

 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries frank j del rio is our president and chief executive officer mr del rio has been responsible for the financial and strategic development of prestige mr del rio founded oceania cruises in october 2002 and played a vital role in the development of renaissance cruises from 1993 to 2001 andrew stuart is our president and chief operating officer of our norwegian brand mr stuart joined norwegian in 1988 and has held several senior management positions in sales marketing and passenger services during his tenure before becoming president and chief operating officer in 2015 jason m montague is our president and chief operating officer for the regent and oceania cruises brands and was instrumental in launching oceania cruises in 2002 and is widely regarded as one of its cofounders wendy beck is our executive vice president and chief financial officer ms beck has been with nclh since 2010 and was instrumental in consummation of the ipo for more on our senior management see “executive officers” below

  

our business strategies 

 

we seek to attract vacationers with our products and services and by creating differentiated itineraries in new markets on our current and upcoming ships with the aim of delivering an enhanced valueadded vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives our business strategies include the following

  

postacquisition of prestige strategy 

 

we have implemented a corporatewide strategy following the acquisition of prestige which we believe will deliver a quality product to our guests and generate returns to our shareholders we termed this strategy the “new deal” which includes three main tenets

  

organic growth  we capitalize on the knowledge throughout the organization to identify areas where marginal changes can be implemented that promote growth from organic sources by sharing best practices across brands our marketing teams find areas of opportunity to more effectively market to past guests not only within each brand but across brands as well

  

driving higher per diems to deliver higher yields we are implementing a markettofill strategy which maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and valueadded promotions when necessary to avoid compromising on price diversification of deployment is another key initiative to drive higher yields our destination management team reviews deployments across the fleet either repositioning ships to new destinations or finetuning itineraries with the goal of creating scarcity which in turn leads to higher pricing we also look to increase demand through effective marketing and an enhanced sales force

  

leveraging scale to suppress costs we leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization in addition we have created a sharedservices model to manage the newly combined company this model places vessel operations finance accounting purchasing legal information technology and human resources as well as other departments as a sharedservice for all three brands this sharedservices model not only generates expenserelated synergies but also facilitates the sharing of best practices across all areas 

  

enhanced product offerings and guest experience 

 

norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea norwegian is also enhancing the guest experience with the norwegian edge a program that includes a multiyear 400 million investment to enhance the guest experience via extensive ship revitalizations and enriched destination experiences we plan to complete these revitalizations and destination enhancements by the end of 2017 at which time nine norwegian ships will have undergone stern to bow refurbishments bringing them to the norwegian edge standards oceania cruises’ awardwinning onboard dining with multiple open seating dining venues is a central highlight of its cruise experience regent’s allinclusive offering includes air transportation shore excursions hotel packages specialty restaurants premium spirits and fine wines gratuities and other amenities regent recently announced a 125 million fleetwide renovation program aimed at upgrading its existing fleet to the same standards as its upcoming seven seas explorer

  



 

  

maximize net yields 

 

we focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and occupancy percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall net yields our specific baseloading initiatives include

  

strategic relationships we developed strategic relationships with travel agencies and international tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times

  

meetings incentives and charters we increased the focus on the meetings incentives and charters channel which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction

  

casino player strategy we have nonexclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests these arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests that we expect to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending

  

disciplined fleet expansion 

 

we have orders with meyer werft shipyard for three breakaway plus class ships for delivery in the spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 these ships will be the largest in our fleet reaching approximately 164600 gross tons with approximately 4100 to 4350 berths each they will be similar in design and innovation to our first breakaway plus class ship norwegian escape which was delivered in october 2015 we also have a contract with fincantieri shipyard to build seven seas explorer to be delivered in the summer of 2016 the allsuite allbalcony seven seas explorer will feature sophisticated designer suites ranging from 300 to 3875 square feet with amongst the highest guesttospace ratio of 760 gross ton per guest and a crewtoguest ratio of 1 to 14 the ship will include five openseating gourmet restaurants regent’s signature ninedeck open atrium a twostory theater two boutiques and an expansive canyon ranch spaclub in november 2014 we acquired a ship from a third party to join the oceania cruises’ fleet which will be named sirena after its current bareboat charter ends in march 2016 we will extensively refurbish the ship to meet our standards the third party provided financing for the contract price we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital

  

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments where travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations

 

we focus on distribution through our three primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters”

  

retailtravel agent the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe asia and australia we have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives we have expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training this education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings

  

international we continue to accelerate our international expansion efforts building on initiatives rolled out in 2015 that focused on increasing our presence in the fast growing asia pacific region we announced the redeployment of norwegian star to the australasia region which was followed by the opening of our sales office in sydney australia which services the growing demand from the asia pacific region for cruises across our three brands

 

our entry into the chinese market includes a multipronged strategy to expand our presence in what many believe will soon become the world’s second largest cruise market we began with the opening of sales and marketing offices in shanghai beijing and hong kong that will serve dual purposes these offices will look to source chinese guests for international cruises across our three brands which together combine to form a broad portfolio of voyages and itineraries to every corner of the globe where a chinese cruiser would look to sail these offices will support our travel partners to source locally for our chinadedicated venture our breakaway plus class ship being launched in the spring of 2017 which will be purposebuilt for chinese consumers the ship will be designed to deliver a blend of the norwegian brand’s offering of freedom and flexibility with amenities and features that will resonate with chinese guests

 

for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks”

  



 

  

meetings incentives and charters this channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction the acquisition of sixthman in 2012 a company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters opened up a new market for travel partners to be able to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests

  

itineraries 

 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from one to 180days calling on over 510 worldwide locations including destinations in scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the americas and europe

 

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on “mustsee” and exotic destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

 

for some of our longer itineraries we maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last 7 to 20 days in order to capture more timeconstrained customers the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises

  

passenger ticket revenue 

 

we offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities including meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation complimentary beverages unlimited shore excursions and precruise hotel packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place

  

onboard and other revenue 

 

all three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare including casino operations certain food and beverage gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items food and beverage casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services are generally managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions norwegian’s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations food and beverage gift shop purchases shore excursions spa services photo services and other similar items to maximize onboard revenue norwegian uses various crossmarketing and promotional tools which are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services oceania cruises’ offerings typically include air transportation and certain other amenities regent’s offerings typically include air transportation a precruise hotel night stay for concierge level and above premium wines and top shelf liquors gratuities and unlimited shore excursions both regent and oceania cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations gift shop purchases shore excursions and spa services

 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 28 of our consolidated revenue in 2015 30 in 2014 and 31 in 2013

  

revenue management practices 

 

our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing we concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields we execute targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering in both north american and select international markets to increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers this marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns we believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

  



 

  

seasonality 

 

our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

  

competition 

 

our primary competition includes operators such as carnival corporation  carnival plc which owns and operates carnival cruise line holland america line princess cruises and seabourn cruise line among others and royal caribbean cruises ltd which owns and operates royal caribbean international celebrity cruises and azamara club cruises among others as well as other cruise lines such as crystal cruises and silversea cruises in addition we compete with landbased vacation alternatives such as hotels and resorts vacation ownership properties casinos and tourist destinations throughout the world

  

marketing strategy 

 

our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales we utilize a multichannel strategy that may include a combination of print television radio websiteecommerce direct mail social media mobile and email campaigns partnerships customer loyalty initiatives market research and businesstobusiness events

 

building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us we have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise

 

travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts we provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other bestselling practices agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform 

 

guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit information that helps shape future direction

  

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

  

ship maintenance and logistics 

 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years depending on age of vessel twice in 5 years depending on flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years depending age of vessel and flag state however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability

  

suppliers 

 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage travel agent services and advertising and marketing most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

  



 

  

crew and staff 

 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships

 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

 

prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits

 

we have developed safety management systems “sms” which establish policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms are approved and audited regularly by our classification society lloyds register and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annualsemiannual inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port and state authorities we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments

  

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

 

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

  

  

  

we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels

 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the imo diplomatic conference agreed to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which took effect on april 23 2014 establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer in addition on december 31 2012 the european union “eu” passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident we believe the amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance however no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required

our entire fleet is also subject to the health safety security and environmental laws and regulations of the various port locales where the ships dock the us bahamas and marshall islands are members of the imo and have adopted and implemented the imo conventions relating to oceangoing passenger ships us law generally requires ships transporting passengers exclusively between and among ports in the us to be built entirely in the us documented under us law crewed by americans and owned by entities that are at least 75 owned and controlled by us citizens we have been granted specific authority to operate in and among the islands of hawaii under legislation known as the “hawaii cruise ship provision” which was part of the “consolidated appropriations resolution 2003” enacted in 2003 public law 1087 division b title ii general provisions—department of commerce section 211 february 20 2003 117 stat 1179 the hawaii cruise ship provision permitted two partially completed ships originally contracted for construction in a us shipyard by an unrelated party to be completed in a shipyard outside of the us and documented under the us flag even if the owner does not meet the 75 us ownership requirement provided that the direct owning entity is organized under the laws of the us and meets certain us citizen officer and director requirements presently only one of the two ships completed in compliance with the hawaii cruise ship provision pride of america operates as a usflagged ship the other pride of hawai’i was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian jade the hawaii cruise ship provision also authorized the redocumentation under the us flag of one additional foreignbuilt cruise ship for operation between us ports in the islands of hawaii pride of aloha in may 2008 pride of aloha was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian sky the hawaii cruise ship provision imposes certain requirements including that any nonwarranty work be performed in the us except in case of emergency or lack of availability and that the ship operates primarily between and among the islands of hawaii as a result of this exemption our usflagged ship deployed in hawaii is able to cruise between us ports in hawaii without the need to call at a foreign port

 

certain ships are also subject to periodic class surveys by ship classification societies including drydock inspections to verify that they have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended maintenance and required repairs have been satisfactorily completed class certification is required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships for more information on drydock work see “ship operations and cruise infrastructure—ship maintenance and logistics”

  



 

  

health and environment 

 

our ships are subject to us and various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that govern air emissions waste discharge water management and disposal and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways specifically in the us we comply with the us environmental protection agency’s vessel general permit “vgp”

 

in the us we must also meet the us public health service’s requirements including ratings by inspectors from the vessel sanitation program of the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the fda we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene to assist cruise lines in achieving the highest health and sanitation standards on cruise ships

 

the us act to prevent pollution from ships which implements the convention for the prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200nautical mile exclusive economic zone “eez”

 

the us oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200nautical mile eez of the us subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility “cofr” from the us coast guard for each ship that operates in these waters our continued opa 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related opa 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance 

 

the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the us environmental protection agency “epa” with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is on inland waters within three nautical miles of land and in designated federally protected waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system was designed to minimize pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the requirements are laid out in the epa’s vgp the vgp establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

 

many coastal us states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability the state of alaska enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

 

the european union “eu” has adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections the european commission’s “ec” strategy is to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships the ec goes beyond the imo requirement by introducing legislation to use low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports

 

marpol specifies requirements for emission control areas “ecas” with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas ships operating in the baltic sea eca the north seaenglish channel eca the north american eca and the us caribbean sea eca are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use approved alternative emission reduction methods other additional ecas may also be established in the future with areas around australia hong kong japan the mediterranean sea and mexico being considered

 

the marpol global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ecas will be reduced to 05 from the current 35 global limit after january 2020 the 05 global standard will be subject to an imo review by 2018 to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard this review will take into account the global fuel oil market supply and demand an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and any other relevant issues if the imo determines that there is insufficient fuel to comply with the 05 standard in january 2020 then this requirement will be delayed until january 2025 at the latest however the european union parliament and council have set january 2020 as the final date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit to enter force regardless of the 2018 imo review results this european union sulfur directive will cover european union member state territorial waters that are within 12 nautical miles of their coastline

 

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited stricter discharge restrictions are currently in effect for new passenger ships whose construction began after january 1 2016 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2018 the underlying requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time however we do not expect it to be material

 

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships furthermore ncl bahmas ltd and ncl america llc are certified

 



 

 

under the international organization for standardization’s 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management system that is incorporated into the company’s sms

 

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

  

permits for glacier bay alaska 

 

in connection with certain alaska cruise operations norwegian relies on concession permits from the us national park service to operate its ships in glacier bay national park and preserve norwegian currently holds a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future

  

security and safety 

 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of solas which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

 

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” we have obtained certificates certifying that our ships are in compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

 

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 and provides for measures strengthening maritime security and places new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports

 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us and docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a federal requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction the solas regulation implemented longrange identification and tracking all of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of solas as amended andor as applicable to the keellaying date

 

maritimelabor 

 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” as amended establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

  

financial requirements 

 

the federal maritime commission “fmc” requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 300 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers the guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments also each of our brands has a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the uk and accordingly has established separate bonds with the association of british travel agents currently valued at approximately british pound sterling 65 million in the aggregate we also are required to establish

 



 

 

financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions

 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

 

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

 

taxation 

  

us income taxation 

 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

 

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

 

under section 883 of the code “section 883” and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

 

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq global select market which is considered to be an established securities market in the us therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that the irs interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares including as a result of the acquisition of prestige which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person other than the sponsors from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

 

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent pch and oceania cruises is treated as a corporation for 2015 both regent and oceania cruises relied on nclh’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 as discussed above for 2014 both regent and oceania cruises relied on pch’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 pch is organized as a company in panama which grants an equivalent tax exemption to us corporations and is thus classified as a qualified foreign country for purposes of section 883 pch was classified as a cfc for the taxable year ended december 31 2014 and we believe pch met the ownership and substantiation requirements of the cfc test under the regulations for that year

  

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 is inapplicable 

 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 in respect of our ussourced shipping income or if the provision was repealed then we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

 



 

 

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

 

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our ussource shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of ussource shipping income and substantially all of our ussource shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

 

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our ussource shipping income the “4 tax regime”

  

other us taxation 

 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

  

income from usflagged operation under ncl america 

 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

  

uk income taxation 

 

as a result of a restructuring nclh and nclc became tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

  

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

 

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 or if the provision was repealed then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

  

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

  

changes in tax laws 

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

  

employees 

 

as of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 2800 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 23700 shipboard employees regent and oceania cruises’ ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

  



 

  

ports and facilities 

 

we have an agreement with the government of bermuda whereby two of our ships are permitted weekly calls in bermuda through 2018 from boston baltimore charleston and new york in addition we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on certain itineraries we purchased a future cruise destination in belize which will be introduced in 2016 we have a contract with the new york city economic development corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights at the manhattan cruise terminal furthermore we have contracts with the port of new orleans and the port of miami pursuant to which we receive preferential berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals in addition we have agreements with similar rights in port canaveral and the port of tampa we have an agreement with the houston port authority through april 15 2017 for certain exclusive berthing rights at the houston passenger cruise terminal we have a concession permit with the us national park service whereby our ships are permitted to call on glacier bay during each summer cruise season through september 30 2019 we entered into an agreement with the british virgin islands port authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15year term with two options to extend the agreement for additional five year terms in seattle we have concluded a lease agreement with the port and have committed to a capital investment of approximately 15 million

  

segment reporting 

 

we have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment each brand oceania cruises regent and norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore each brand is considered an operating segment our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics including similar margins and similar products and services therefore we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment

 

although we sell cruises on an international basis our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to ussourced guests who make reservations in the us revenue attributable to ussourced guests was 75 73  and 74 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively no other individual country’s revenues exceeded 10 in any of our last three years substantially all of our long–lived assets are located outside of the us and consist primarily of our ships we have 16 ships with bahamas registry with a carrying value of 72 billion and 64 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we have five ships with marshall island registry with a carrying value of 14 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we also have one ship with us registry with a carrying value of 03 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and one ship with bermuda registry with a carrying value of 008 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change additional risks include imposition of trade barriers restrictions on repatriation of earnings withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

  

our efforts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets in the asia pacific region and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

  

terrorist acts acts of piracy armed conflict and threats thereof and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

 

the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility thereof an increase in the activity of pirates operating off the western coast of africa or elsewhere political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories by national governments and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

  



 

  

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks while we have and continue to invest in business continuity disaster recovery and data restoration plans we cannot completely insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

 

we have also made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation if our security systems were breached we could be exposed to cyberrelated risks and malware and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk

 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems we may incur costs associated with the following breach response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees and damages denial of service attacks may result in costs associated with among other things the following response forensics public relations consultants data restoration legal fees and settlement in addition data security breaches or denial of service attacks may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results while we have and continue to invest in data and information technology security initiatives we cannot completely insulate ourselves from the risks of data security breaches and denial of service attacks that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results

  

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected

  

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor expenditures

  

changes in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations 

 

fuel expense accounted for 135 of our total cruise operating expense for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 168 and 183 for the same periods in 2014 and 2013 respectively future increases in the cost of fuel globally would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to or may enter into in the future increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests

  



 

  

our hedging strategies may not be costeffective or adequately protect us from increased costs related to changes in fuel prices 

 

in order to manage risks associated with the variable market prices of fuel we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements however our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be costeffective will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future

 

our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

there can be no assurance that all of our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage at all or at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments 

 

our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations prospects and flexibility our substantial indebtedness could

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things

 

  

  

  

  

  



 

 

  

  

  

  

  

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

  

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

  

  

  

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness

 

if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

  

despite our substantial indebtedness we may still be able to incur significantly more debt this could intensify certain of the risks described above 

 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness at any time in the future although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things

 

  

  

there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that we will be able to borrow additional amounts under our existing debt agreements or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on numerous factors including but not limited to the condition of the capital markets our financial condition at such time credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources sufficient to service our debt we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations some or all of our assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value however and we may not be able to consummate such dispositions for fair market value or at all furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due

 



 

 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness include and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may include exceptions to certain covenants that permit us to incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments and take other actions

  

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we earn revenues pay expenses purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period the strengthening of the us dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our us dollar financial results and will reduce the us dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into us dollars

 

we have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies while we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated

 

our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth we need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years this may require significant efforts on the part of our management team and our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business

 

our executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us

  

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

 

the majority of our guests book their cruises through independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators in the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic downturn or by other factors this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 

additionally independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators generally sell and market our cruises on a nonexclusive basis although we offer commissions and other incentives to them for booking our cruises there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in the future travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors particularly in the north american market to sell and market our competitors’ cruises exclusively if such exclusive arrangements were introduced there can be no assurances that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected

  

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

 



 

 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

  

delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs maintenance and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our cruise ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for refurbishment and repairs due to reduced competition also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

  

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our cruise ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

  

our revenue is seasonal owing to variations in passenger fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year we may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses during certain periods of the year 

 

the demand for our cruises is seasonal with the greatest demand for cruises generally occurring during the northern hemisphere’s summer months this seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for drydocks which we typically schedule during offpeak demand periods for such ships accordingly seasonality in demand and drydock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during certain periods of the year

  

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

  

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

currently we are a party to eight collective bargaining agreements two of these agreements are in effect through 2016 and three through 2017 the remaining three are set to expire in march and june of 2018 any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 



 

  

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies any limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

  

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

  

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

  

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publicly traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 and subject all or a portion of our

 



 

 

shipping income to taxation in the us moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

  

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

 

some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual countries and us states are considering as well as implementing new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations and waste in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol an international environmental regulation and stcw and its conventions in ship manning international regulations regarding ballast water and security levels are currently pending

 

additionally the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies such as requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations in 2006 alaskan voters approved a ballot measure requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” pursuant to the ballot measure alaska approved stringent regulations and required a waste water discharge permit for cruise ships beginning in 2008 legislation approved in 2009 allowed the state to issue general permits that contain effluent limits or standards that are less stringent than the wqs where the ship is using economically feasible methods of pollution prevention in 2013 the state extended the permit program and allowed ship operators to apply for mixing zones in upcoming permits an option that may ease compliance with certain wqs the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 the convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special ecas with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands have been included as of january 2014 are generally expected to meet the new sulfur oxide emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels

 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future

 

by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues”

 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

  

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

  

although nclh is no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of nasdaq since the completion of the secondary equity offering in may 2015 during a oneyear transition period nclh may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to shareholders of companies that are subject to those corporate governance requirements 

 

prior to the secondary equity offering in may 2015 the sponsors controlled a majority of nclh’s voting ordinary shares and as a result nclh was a “controlled company” under nasdaq rules and elected not to comply with certain nasdaq corporate governance requirements following the secondary equity offering in may 2015 the sponsors no longer control more than 50 of nclh’s voting ordinary shares and consequently nclh is no longer considered a “controlled company” as a result nclh is subject to additional governance requirements under nasdaq rules including the requirements to have

 

   



 

 

  

the nasdaq rules provide for phasein periods for these requirements but we must be fully compliant with the requirements within one year of the date on which we ceased to be a “controlled company” currently nclh does not have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors and only two of the three members of its nominating and governance committee and its compensation committee are independent during this transition period nclh’s shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the nasdaq corporate governance requirements in addition nclh may not be able to attract and retain the number of independent directors needed to comply with nasdaq rules during the transition period

  

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as shareholders of a us corporation 

 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

  

nclh does not have current plans to pay dividends on its ordinary shares 

 

nclh does not currently intend to pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

in 2015 the alaska department of environmental conservation issued notices of violations to major cruise lines that operated in the state of alaska including nclh for alleged violations of the alaska marine vessel visible emission standards that occurred over the last several years we are cooperating with the alaska department of environmental conservation and conducting our own internal investigation into these matters however we do not believe the ultimate outcome will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

in the normal course of our business various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

financial presentation 

 

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere’s summer months

 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services photo services as well as certain bareboat charter revenue we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies

  



 

  

ship accounting 

 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2015 would have increased by 100 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 492 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

  

asset impairment 

 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates judgments and projections considered necessary the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets principally tradenames are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered we use the step 0 test which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value in order to make this evaluation we consider the following circumstances

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge if a material change occurred we may conduct a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill this is called the step i test which consists of a combined approach using the expected future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units

 

as of december 31 2015 our annual review consisting of the step 0 and step i test supports the carrying value of these assets

  



 

  

contingencies 

 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

  

nongaap financial measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue adjusted net revenue net yield adjusted net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definitions of these nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the us a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly british pound canadian dollar euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

 

in addition adjusted net revenue and adjusted net yield which excludes certain business combination accounting entries are nongaap financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance the amounts excluded in the presentation of these nongaap financial measures may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net revenue adjusted net yield adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results

 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

revenue 

 

total revenue increased 390 to 43 billion in 2015 compared to 31 billion in 2014 net revenue increased 379 in 2015 primarily due to an increase in capacity days of 175 and net yield of 174 the increase in capacity days was primarily due to the acquisition of prestige the delivery of norwegian escape and the operation of norwegian getaway for the full year of 2015 the increase in net yield was primarily due to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and higher onboard and other revenue adjusted net revenue for 2015 includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of 324 million related to the acquisition of prestige on a constant currency basis net yield and adjusted net yield increased 194 and 200 respectively in 2015 compared to 2014

  

expense 

 

total cruise operating expense increased 364 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the increase in capacity days as discussed above total other operating expense increased 460 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in marketing general and administrative expenses primarily related to the acquisition of prestige including certain restructuring and severance costs as well as amortization expense related to the prestige intangible assets and depreciation expense related to the prestige ships these increases were partially offset by the 434 million fair value adjustment for the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of prestige

 



 

 

on a capacity day basis net cruise cost increased 140 148 on a constant currency basis due to an increase in marketing general and administrative expenses as discussed above and certain crew related expenses partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense which was primarily the result of a 138 decrease in the average fuel price to 539 per metric ton in 2015 from 625 per metric ton in 2014 adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 240 250 on a constant currency basis primarily due to the increase in expenses discussed above

 

interest expense net increased to 2219 million in 2015 from 1518 million in 2014 primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding in connection with the acquisition of prestige other income expense was an expense of 467 million in 2015 compared to an expense of 109 million in 2014 this increase was primarily related to an expense of 307 million from the dedesignation of certain fuel swap derivative hedge contracts and the ineffectiveness of settled fuel swaps in 2015 also included in 2015 was an expense of 262 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign exchange collar which does not receive hedge accounting treatment partially offset by 110 million of foreign currency transaction gains

 

we had an income tax expense of 68 million in 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of 23 million in 2014 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed the implementation of a global tax platform which had a favorable impact on the amount of income subject to us corporate tax which continued through calendar year 2014 and 2015 in addition during the first quarter of 2014 we received information which allowed us to elect a tax method to calculate deductible interest expense resulting in a tax benefit of 111 million including a 53 million nonrecurring benefit that has been excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted eps for the year ended december 31 2014

  

year ended december 31 2014 “2014” compared to year ended december 31 2013 “2013” 

  

revenue 

 

total revenue increased 216 to 31 billion in 2014 compared to 26 billion in 2013 net revenue increased 250 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in capacity days of 198 the increase in capacity days was primarily due to the delivery of norwegian breakaway in april 2013 and norwegian getaway in january 2014 the net yield improvement of 43 was due to higher net ticket and net onboard and other revenue adjusted net revenue for 2014 includes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of 101 million related to the acquisition of prestige the improvement in adjusted net yield was primarily the result of a 33 increase in norwegian standalone net yield 32 on a constant currency basis and partially due to the addition of prestige’s brands to the fleet

  

expense 

 

total cruise operating expense increased 174 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the increase in capacity days as discussed above total other operating expense increased 309 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to transaction expenses related to the acquisition of prestige and certain inaugural and launchrelated costs for norwegian getaway and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the addition of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway on a capacity day basis net cruise cost increased 36 due to the increase in expenses explained above partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense the fuel price per metric ton excluding the impact of hedges was 605 in 2014 compared to 686 in 2013 we experienced a negative impact in 2014 of 103 million on our hedge portfolio due to recent reductions in fuel prices compared to a benefit of 47 million in 2013 net of hedges fuel price per metric ton decreased to 625 in 2014 compared to 675 in 2013 the company’s fuel consumption per capacity day decreased 31 on a capacity day basis net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 78 primarily due to costs related to the acquisition of prestige and certain general and administrative costs and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 35 adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel was relatively unchanged on a norwegian standalone constant currency basis

 

interest expense net decreased to 1518 million in 2014 from 2826 million in 2013 interest expense net for 2014 reflected an increase in average debt outstanding associated with newbuild financings and debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of prestige partially offset by lower interest rates from the benefits from the redemption of higher rate debt and refinancing transactions in addition 2014 reflects 154 million of expenses related to financing transactions in conjunction with the acquisition of prestige while 2013 reflects 1606 million of expenses associated with debt prepayments

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

 

as of december 31 2015 our liquidity was 6659 million consisting of 1159 million in cash and cash equivalents and 5500 million available under our revolving credit facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

 

as of december 31 2015 we had a working capital deficit of 20 billion this deficit included 10 billion of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our revolving credit facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

 

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to make distributions andor to pay dividends to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

norwegian escape was delivered in october 2015 we have three other breakaway plus class ships on order with meyer werft shipyard for delivery in the spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 these ships will be the largest in our fleet reaching approximately 164600 gross tons the combined contract price of these three ships is approximately €25 billion or 27 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2015 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of their contract prices we also have a contract with fincantieri shipyard to build a cruise ship to be named seven seas explorer the original contract price of the ship is approximately €3430 million or approximately 3726 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2015 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of the ship’s contract price seven seas explorer is expected to be delivered in the summer of 2016

  



 

  

in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 319 million 220 million and 263 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

  

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

none

  

contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2015 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

other 

 

certain service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

  

funding sources 

 

our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends our ships and substantially all other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2015

 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets has created a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional equity will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

  



 

  




 item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

  

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

  

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2015 we had interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2015 56 of our debt was fixed and 44 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2015 was 7159 million based on our december 31 2015 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 282 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2015 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €13 billion or 14 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2015 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2015 would result in a 1461 million change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

  

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 135 168 and 183 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2015 we had hedged approximately 60 56 49 and 32 of our 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2016 fuel expense by 219 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 70 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

history and development of the company 

 

nclh is a diversified cruise operator of leading global cruise lines spanning market segments from contemporary to luxury under the norwegian oceania and regent brands these brands operate 21 ships with approximately 40000 berths visiting approximately 420 worldwide destinations the company’s brands will introduce six additional ships through 2019 increasing the total berths to approximately 58000 norwegian is the innovator in cruise travel with a history of breaking the boundaries of traditional cruising most notably with the introduction of “freestyle cruising” which revolutionized the industry by giving guests more freedom and flexibility on the most contemporary ships at sea oceania is the market leader in the upperpremium cruise segment featuring the finest cuisine at sea elegant accommodations impeccable service and destinationdriven itineraries regent is the market leader in the luxury cruise segment with allsuite accommodations highly personalized service and the industry’s most inclusive luxury experience featuring roundtrip air fine wines and spirits and unlimited shore excursions among its numerous included amenities

 

norwegian commenced operations from miami in 1966 in february 2000 genting hk acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the norwegian operations

 

in january 2008 the apollo funds acquired 50 of the outstanding ordinary share capital of nclc as part of this investment the apollo funds assumed control of nclc’s board of directors also in january 2008 the tpg viking funds acquired in the aggregate 125 of nclc’s outstanding share capital from the apollo funds

 

on january 24 2013 nclh completed its ipo pursuant to which it sold 27058824 ordinary shares for net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of approximately 4739 million

 

in august 2013 december 2013 and march 2014 the sponsors completed the secondary equity offerings

 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of prestige we believe that the combination of norwegian and prestige creates a diversified cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market presence prestige holds a leading position in the upscale segment of the cruise industry prestige’s wellknown oceania and regent brands focus on providing guests with vacation experiences onboard eight midsize cruise ships that are characterized by highquality service gourmet cuisine luxurious accommodations and itineraries to worldwide destinations

 

as a result of the aforementioned transactions the sponsors owned 560 of nclh’s ordinary shares as of december 31 2014

 

corporate reorganization 

 

in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 001 per share in connection with the consummation of the ipo the sponsors’ ordinary shares in nclc were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” at the same time nclh contributed 4600 million to nclc and the historical financial statements of nclc became those of nclh the corporate reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure nclh had not prior to the completion of the corporate reorganization conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the corporate reorganization and ipo

 

nclc was treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the terms of the partnership including the economic rights with respect thereto were set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for nclc economic interests in nclc were represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement which we refer to as “ncl corporation units”

 

in connection with the corporate reorganization nclc’s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management or former management of nclc were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of ncl corporation units we refer to the ncl corporation units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as management ncl corporation units as a result of the corporate reorganization the management ncl corporation units created a noncontrolling interest within nclh the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests were subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged the management ncl corporation units issued in exchange for the profits interests represented a 27 economic interest in nclc as of the consummation of the ipo

 

subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units had the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for ordinary shares of nclh at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations

 





 

and similar extraordinary events any nonpro rata tax distributions made to a management ncl corporation unit holder would have reduced the amount of nclh’s ordinary shares or cash that the holder would have otherwise received upon exchange on august 19 2013 nclh filed a registration statement with the sec to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elected to exchange

 

when a holder of a management ncl corporation unit exchanged such unit for one of nclh’s ordinary shares or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares the relative economic interests of the exchanging ncl corporation unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of nclh were not altered as a result of the corporate reorganization a noncontrolling interest was created within nclh and nclh’s financial statements and financial results differ from nclc’s in certain respects

 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 all management ncl corporation units were exchanged for nclh ordinary shares and restricted shares nclh became the sole member and 100 owner of the economic interests in nclc and the noncontrolling interest no longer exists accordingly nclc is now treated as a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes no new nclc profits interests or management ncl corporation units will be issued however nclh has granted and expects to continue to grant options to acquire its ordinary shares to our management team under its longterm incentive plan

our industry and competition 

  

the various cruise lines that make up the global cruise vacation industry have historically been segmented by product offering and service quality into “contemporary” “premium” and “luxury” segments the contemporary segment generally includes cruises on larger ships that last seven days or less provide a casual ambiance and are less expensive on average than the premium or luxury segment cruises the premium segment is generally characterized by cruises that last from seven to 14 nights with a higher quality product offering than the contemporary segment appealing to a more affluent demographic the luxury segment generally offers the highest level of service and quality with longer cruises on the smallest ships we believe that oceania offers an “upperpremium” cruise experience therefore we categorize it in an “upperpremium” segment

 





 

in classifying norwegian’s competitors within the major north american cruise brands the contemporary segment has historically included carnival corporation and royal caribbean cruises the premium segment has historically included celebrity cruises holland america and princess cruises we believe that norwegian straddles the contemporary and premium segments and offers a combination of value and leisure services to cruise guests

 

oceania’s and regent’s competition typically includes azamara club cruises owned by royal caribbean cruises in the upper premium segment and crystal cruises silversea cruises and seabourn cruise line owned by carnival corporation in the luxury segment collectively these operators make up prestige’s upscale segment competition historically people 55 years of age and older have had the highest disposable income levels and the most leisure time making them prime candidates for upscale segment cruising given the longer itineraries and higher per diems of cruises in this category

  

our company 

  

norwegian business overview 

 

norwegian offers a wide variety of cruises ranging in length from one day to three weeks each of norwegian’s 13 modern ships has been purposebuilt to consistently deliver the “freestyle cruising” product offering which we believe provides norwegian with a competitive advantage by differentiating it from other cruise line offerings by focusing on “freestyle cruising” norwegian has been able to achieve higher onboard spend levels greater guest loyalty and the ability to attract a more diverse clientele “freestyle cruising” offers flexibility and choice to our guests who prefer to dine when they want with whomever they want and without having to dress formally

 

during 2014 norwegian’s ships docked at 126 ports worldwide with itineraries originating from 19 ports of which 13 are in north america in line with norwegian’s strategy of innovation many of these north american ports are part of the “homeland cruising” program in which it has homeports that are close to major population centers such as new york boston and miami this reduces the need for vacationers to fly to distant ports to embark on a cruise and helps reduce norwegian guests’ overall vacation cost norwegian offers a wide selection of exotic itineraries outside of the traditional cruising markets of the caribbean and mexico including cruises in europe the mediterranean and the baltic bermuda alaska and the industry’s only entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii with norwegian’s usflagged ship pride of america norwegian’s hawaii itinerary is unparalleled in the cruise industry as all other ships from competing cruise lines are registered outside the us and are required to dock at a distant foreign port when providing their guests with a hawaiibased cruise itinerary

 

by providing such a distinctive experience and an appealing combination of value and service norwegian straddles both the contemporary and premium segments norwegian has been recognized for its achievements as the recipient of multiple honorary awards mainly consisting of reviews tabulated from the readers of travel periodicals such as travel weekly condé nast traveler and travel  leisure as well as being recognized as “europe’s leading cruise line” seven years in a row and as both “caribbean’s leading cruise line” and “world’s leading large ship cruise line” by the world travel awards norwegian breakaway which was launched in 2013 was named “best new ship” by the editors of cruise critic and “best rookie cruise ship” by the readers of travel weekly norwegian getaway which was launched in january 2014 was bon voyage magazine’s editor’s choice for “best new ship” travel weekly readers’ choice “best new ship” in 2014 and travalliance travvy awards “best cruise ship contemporary” in 2015

 

we have continued to add new ships to our fleet orders have been placed with meyer werft for four breakaway plus class ships for delivery in the fall of 2015 spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 these ships will be the largest in norwegian’s fleet at approximately 164600 gross tons and up to 4200 berths each will be similar in design and innovation to the breakaway class ships the combined contract price of these four ships is approximately €30 billion or 36 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014 norwegian has export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of each of the ships’ contract prices

  

prestige business overview 

 

prestige is a leading operator in the upscale segment of the cruise industry with two cruise brands oceania and regent these two brands operate a total of eight ships with over 6400 berths accounting for approximately 46 of the capacity measured by berths of the upscale segment most suites and staterooms in prestige’s fleet feature a private balcony which caters to customers in the upscale segment these customers are typically affluent welltraveled retirees who are high repeat guests and book reservations far in advance we believe prestige’s fleet has some of the highest spacetoguest and crewtopassenger ratios in the industry providing our guests with luxurious accommodations and individuallytailored service levels we believe prestige has a highly attractive financial profile with industryleading net yields and high visibility to future bookings

our competitive strengths 

 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy

 

diversified cruise operator with highquality product offerings 

 

we believe the complementary fleets of norwegian and prestige provide a diversified portfolio of cruise products that represent all significant segments of the cruise industry the norwegian brand caters to the contemporary and premium segments with modern stateoftheart ships amenities onboard experiences and our “freestyle cruising” offering oceania caters to the upper premium segment while regent caters to the luxury segment of the cruise industry these complementary product offerings along with the strengths and skill sets of personnel from each of the brands provide numerous opportunities for crossselling and crossbrand collaboration

  

norwegian’s modern fleet with a weightedaverage age of 81 years as of december 31 2014 and no ships built before 1998 norwegian has the most modern fleet among the major north american cruise brands which we believe allows us to offer a highquality passenger experience with a significant level of consistency across the entire fleet norwegian continues to invest in the brand through our 250 million norwegian next program a set of new enhancements experiences and transformations aimed at elevating the guest experience which include new restaurants and menus a broader range of entertainment options and an increased focus on integrating technology and innovation into the guest experience

diverse selection of premium itineraries the combination of norwegian and prestige further diversifies our already broad range of premium itineraries norwegian’s existing mix of destinations is more consistent with the brands in the premium segment and these itineraries typically attract higher net yields than caribbean and mexico sailings prestige ships have a worldwide deployment visiting approximately 350 ports each year including destinations such as scandinavia russia the mediterranean the greek isles alaska canada and new england asia tahiti and the south pacific australia and new zealand africa india south america the panama canal and the caribbean the company’s full year 2014 deployment outside the caribbean increased to 62 as compared to 51 for norwegian on a norwegian standalone basis

  

established brand recognition 

 

over 91 of cruisers are aware of the norwegian brand which is known for freedom flexibility and choice—highly valued benefits for norwegian’s target audience within the cruise vacation market

 

the oceania and regent brands are well established in the upper premium and luxury segments of the cruise industry respectively for offering the highest level of luxury and service to customers

  

loyal and repeat customer base 

 

the norwegian oceania and regent brands each have loyal and repeat customer bases norwegian achieves highquality feedback scores from guests in the areas of overall service physical ship attributes onboard products and services food and beverage entertainment and landbased excursions in 2014 approximately 59 of prestige’s total guests responded to prestige’s customer satisfaction survey of which 97 of respondents reported that their cruise experience “met or exceeded” their expectations and 93 reported they will “likely” return

  





  

strong cash flow 

 

we believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility at the norwegian oceania and regent brands all three brands afford the ability to presell tickets and receive customer deposits with long lead times ahead of sailing the cash flow impact of newbuild capital expenditures is mitigated as we have export credit financing in place for all newbuild ships to fund approximately 80 of the contract price of each ship

 

highly experienced management team 

 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries frank j del rio is our president and chief executive officer mr del rio founded oceania in october 2002 and played a vital role in the development of renaissance cruises from 1993 to april 2001 andrew madsen is our president and chief operating officer of our norwegian brand prior to joining the company mr madsen served as president and chief operating officer of darden restaurants inc for over 8 years prior to that he served in various executive positions jason m montague is our president and chief operating officer for the regent and oceania brands he was instrumental in launching oceania in 2002 and is widely regarded as one of the cofounders prior to nclh’s acquisition of prestige mr montague served as chief financial officer and executive vice president of prestige from september 2010 until nclh’s acquisition of prestige in november 2014 for more on our senior management see “executive officers” below

  

strong sponsors with extensive industry expertise 

 

our sponsors and their affiliates have extensive experience investing in the cruise leisure and travelrelated industries we believe that the synergies and purchasing power obtained through these affiliates have resulted in better price negotiations for us and our affiliates for selected supplies and services

  

our business strategies 

 

we seek to attract vacationers with our products and services and by creating differentiated itineraries in new markets through additional and existing modern and classic ships with the aim of delivering a better valueadded vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives our business strategies include the following

  

enhance product offerings and guest experience 

 

norwegian’s ships offer up to 28 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea norwegian has completed more than 33 million of renovations to our private island great stirrup cay which includes a new marina dining and bar facility as well as private cabanas and new activities norwegian is also enhancing the guest experience with our norwegian next program which includes new enhancements and transformations to our product offering in 2013 norwegian purchased a future cruise destination in belize which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2015

 

prestige offers worldwide itineraries to approximately 350 ports each year allowing the brands to meet customers’ demands for a global and differentiated travel experience we believe that prestige’s destinationfocused worldwide itineraries of varying lengths augmented by exciting shore excursions other land based programs and diverse onboard enrichment programs differentiate the oceania and regent brands from prestige’s competitors prestige’s awardwinning onboard dining is a central highlight of its cruise experience with multiple open seating dining venues where guests may dine when where and with whom they wish

  

maximize net yields 

 

norwegian and prestige use a strategy called baseloading to fill their capacity by booking guests as early before sailing as possible by utilizing certain sales and marketing tactics to generate business with longer booking windows to maximize passenger ticket revenue baseloading allows us to fill ships earlier and avoid discounting close to sailing dates in order to achieve targeted occupancy percentages

 

prestige’s differentiated price enhancing revenue management strategy encourages customers to book early to obtain the most attractive value offering when new itineraries are launched prestige clearly articulates to potential customers and travel agents that prices are subject to increase as the cruise date approaches as well as the specific dates on which those price increases may occur prestige uses a threeprong marketing strategy to maximize revenue from each customer by i keeping travel agents engaged and informed ii using inbound and outbound sales call programs to target highpotential customers and iii executing targeted and highfrequency marketing campaigns to communicate a message with prestige’s cruise offerings

 

norwegian focuses on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and occupancy percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall net yields norwegian’s specific baseloading initiatives include

  

casino player strategy as part of this strategy norwegian has nonexclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide including caesars entertainment whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable

 





 

for cruises on norwegian ships through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs norwegian has the opportunity to market cruises to caesars entertainment’s guests these arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests that we expect to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending

  

strategic relationships norwegian has developed strategic relationships with travel agencies and international tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times

  

meetings incentives and charters norwegian increased the focus on the meetings incentives and charters channel which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction

  

disciplined fleet expansion 

 

we have orders with meyer werft for four breakaway plus class ships for delivery in the fall of 2015 spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 these ships will be the largest in our fleet reaching approximately 164600 gross tons and up to 4200 berths each and will be similar in design and innovation to our breakaway class ships we also have a contract with italy’s fincantieri shipyard to build a luxury cruise ship to be named seven seas explorer the contract price of the ship is approximately €3430 million or approximately 4150 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014 seven seas explorer is expected to be delivered in the summer of 2016 the allsuite allbalcony seven seas explorer will feature sophisticated designer suites ranging from 300 to 3875 square feet with an industry leading space ratio of 760 and a crewtoguest ratio of 1 to 14 the ship will include six openseating gourmet restaurants regent’s signature ninedeck open atrium a twostory theater two boutiques and an expansive canyon ranch spaclub upon delivery of seven seas explorer regent will be the world’s largest luxury cruise line in terms of berths in november 2014 we purchased a ship from a third party to join the oceania fleet which will be named sirena after its current charter ends in march 2016 we will extensively refurbish the ship to oceania standards and it will be a sister ship to the rclass ships the third party provided financing for the contract price we believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital

  

improve operating efficiency and lower costs 

 

we continually focus on enhancing financial performance through a variety of business improvement initiatives designed to reduce costs while improving the overall product we deliver since the beginning of 2008 nclh and prestige have significantly reduced their operating cost base through various programs including contract renegotiations overhead rationalization global purchasing and logistics optimization and fuel consumption reduction initiatives we hedge fuel purchases in order to provide greater visibility of fuel expense as of december 31 2014 we had hedged approximately 68 55 39 and 8 of our remaining 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we expect the addition of oceania and regent as well as the upcoming newbuilds for both norwegian and prestige to drive further operating efficiencies over the long term

 

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

 

as part of our growth strategy we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels we most recently announced a substantial expansion of our north american sales team almost doubling the number of business development managers in the field and increasing the overall sales group by more than 40 percent we continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and reservation departments where travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations

 

we focus on distribution through our primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters”

  

retailtravel agent   the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe asia and australia norwegian introduced our partners first program in 2011 and since then has implemented over 200 initiatives specifically designed to improve efficiency with travel agent channels and our guests recently norwegian revolutionized and streamlined our booking process by introducing “universal agents” that have the ability to handle both group and full individual tariff bookings additionally norwegian launched a new onlinebooking tool that features an array of functionalities giving travel partners more freedom and flexibility to make reservations online providing the ability to customize management and promotion of group reservations

 

the addition of prestige’s oceania and regent brands product portfolio gives us access to travel agents specializing in the upscale segment that would traditionally not market or sell norwegian cruises prestige has made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies transparent pricing strategies effective marketing tools improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives we have sales force teams dedicated to oceania and regent who work

 





 

closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness through product training education and the sharing of “bestpractices”

  

international norwegian has an international sales presence in europe and representatives covering latin america australia and asia norwegian is primarily focused on increasing business in the european market which has grown significantly in recent years but remains underpenetrated in europe norwegian offers local itineraries yearround and “freestyle cruising” has been well received norwegian expanded its sales force in europe allowing development of distribution in europe in a manner similar to its us operation in support of this european strategy in 2013 norwegian epic was deployed in europe for an extended summer season and announced a yearround deployment for 2015 norwegian also initiated a twoship yearround deployment in europe with norwegian jade and norwegian spirit norwegian is forging a closer distribution partnership with genting hk to develop product distribution across the asia pacific region and for further product distribution in south america we have invested in a brazilian sales channel

 

the acquisition of prestige enhances our international sourcing prestige sources approximately 30 of passengers from outside of north america compared to approximately 15 for norwegian further diversifying our sourcing profile prestige has an international sales office in southampton uk that services europe and various general sales agents covering latin america australia and asia we expect to leverage prestige’s global experience and market position to further enhance norwegian’s international profile

 

for information regarding risks associated with our international operations see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks”

  

meetings incentives and charters this channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meeting and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship’s capacity or even an entire sailing in one transaction the acquisition of sixthman in 2012 a company specializing in developing and delivering musicoriented charters opened up a new market for travel partners to be able to sell highquality music experiences at sea to guests seeking more innovative entertainment options

  

expand strategic marketing partnerships 

 

we seek to develop strategic marketing partnerships with wellknown entertainment sports and lifestyle brands which complement our brand positioning norwegian’s partnership with the radio city rockettes who christened norwegian breakaway includes a marketing partnership that names norwegian as the “official cruise line” of the rockettes and radio city music hall and an “official partner” of the radio city christmas spectacular in addition an exhibit showcasing the history of the rockettes is integrated into norwegian breakaway norwegian is also the “official cruise line” of the new york knicks strengthening norwegian breakaway’s branding as new york’s ship to bolster the ties between norwegian getaway and her homeport of miami norwegian is the “official cruise line” of the miami dolphins and sun life stadium in addition the miami dolphin cheerleaders served as godmothers of norwegian getaway which houses a selection of miami dolphin memorabilia norwegian is also the “official cruise line partner” of the grammy awards and offers the first grammy experience at sea a venue for musical performances that include grammy winning and nominated artists on norwegian getaway norwegian also recently announced a partnership with the michael mondavi family to enhance wine offerings fleetwide and a partnership with jimmy buffet’s “margaritaville” restaurants and bars we will introduce the first margaritaville at sea on norwegian escape our first breakaway plus class ship and will incorporate the other margaritaville brands on certain of our ships and on our island destinations

 

prestige has a number of highprofile partnerships including jacques pepin the smithsonian institution ralph lauren home and dakota jackson oceania has engaged master chef jacques pepin as its executive culinary director marina and riviera’s jacques restaurant was decorated with heirloom antiques furnishings and art from pepin’s personal collection each dish has been reinterpreted by master chef pepin the marina and riviera feature suites designed and furnished by ralph lauren home and noted furniture designer dakota jackson starting in july 2015 the smithsonian institution will be hosting a new enrichment program the smithsonian collection by smithsonian journeys on regent this new guest lecture series will feature a wide range of experts from noted art historians to leading authors and former diplomats leading spirited discussions both aboard the ships and ashore

  

itineraries 

 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from one day to 180days calling on over 420 worldwide locations including destinations in the caribbean mexico alaska europe hawaii canada new england central and south america africa asia tahiti and the south pacific and australia and new zealand we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the americas and europe

 

we believe that these destinationfocused itineraries complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program which is included in the allinclusive fare for cruises on the regent ships differentiate our brands from many of our competitors we call on “mustsee”

 





 

and exotic destinations many of which include overnight stays in port allowing guests to have more indepth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call

 

we offer a wide variety of cruises ranging in length from one day to three weeks under our norwegian brand each of norwegian’s 13 modern ships have been purposebuilt to consistently deliver the “freestyle cruising” product offering which we believe provides norwegian with a competitive advantage by differentiating it from other cruise line offerings

 

oceania operates cruises that are primarily 10 12 and 16 days in length oceania also operates a number of itineraries that last between 20 and 180 days regent also offers several longer itineraries of up to 136 days which is a staple of the luxury segment at the same time regent has expanded an addressable market and captured guest spending for a greater portion of guests’ cruising life cycle by selling segments of these longer itineraries as shorter cruises ie which last seven to 20 days designed for more timeconstrained customers the deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates offpeak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises

 

passenger ticket revenue 

  

our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities including meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation topshelf open bars unlimited shore excursions and precruise hotel packages prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place we generate additional revenue on certain of our ships from casino operations gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items

 

revenue management practices 

 

norwegian bases ticket pricing and revenue management on a strategy focused on developing early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields norwegian performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in addition stateroom categories are identified throughout each cruise ship and prices for cruise fares are based on these stateroom categories typically the initial published fares are established 18 months in advance of the departure of a cruise at a level which under normal circumstances would provide a high occupancy if the rate at which stateroom inventory is sold differs from expectations prices are adjusted for each stateroom category accordingly this can be done through promotions special rate codes opening and closing categories or price changes

 

prestige bases ticket pricing and revenue management on a strategy based on marketing efforts “market to fill” as the cruise date approaches prestige clearly articulates to customers and travel agents that the initial launch offers will be the lowest price package and that these prices and certain offers in the package are subject to increase as the cruise date approaches as well as the specific dates on which those increases may occur this strategy assists in maintaining and improving a high price point which is fundamental in the upscale segment

 

prestige concentrates on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher net yields prestige executes targeted and high frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a valuepacked cruise offering in both north american and select international markets to increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs prestige emphasizes communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilizes call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers this threeprong marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns we believe these strategies and other initiatives carried out by the prestige sales organization and distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in net yields achieved

 

each of our brands maintain separate sales and marketing teams as well as reservation centers which allows each brand to effectively communicate its identity and brand promise to its intended market

  

onboard and other revenue 

 

norwegian ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations food and beverage gift shop purchases spa services photo services and other similar items to maximize onboard revenue norwegian uses various crossmarketing and promotional tools and are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these onboard products and services food and beverage gaming and shore excursions are generally managed directly by norwegian while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services are generally managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions

 





 

certain prestige ticket prices have an allinclusive element regent’s offerings typically include free air transportation a precruise hotel night stay premium wines and top shelf liquors gratuities and unlimited shore excursions oceania’s offerings typically include free air transportation and on certain sailings other amenities therefore prestige derives nearly all of its revenue from passenger ticket revenue hence it is important for prestige to maintain a pricing discipline focusing on passenger ticket we believe that this pricing discipline for prestige drives revenue performance relatively longbooking windows and allows us to maintain a positive relationship with the travel agency community

 

onboard and other revenue accounted for 29 of our revenue in each of the years 2014 and 2013 and 30 in 2012

  

seasonality 

 

our revenue is seasonal based on the demand for cruises historically the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the northern hemisphere summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods

  

marketing brand communications and advertising 

  

our marketing departments work to enhance our brand awareness and increase levels of engagement and understanding of our product and services among consumers trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales core areas within the department include brand strategy advertising and media marketing communications direct marketing partnerships customer loyalty websiteecommerce and market research norwegian’s marketing supports the brands’ specific messages norwegian’s comprehensive brand platform was created expressly to leverage norwegian’s “freestyle cruising” concept our brand platform “cruise like a norwegian” is intended to develop a sense of community around norwegian and communicates its commitment to providing an exceptional vacation experience centered around freedom and flexibility our broad guest base and growing business demands a multichannel media strategy that works throughout the guest lifecycle and includes a mix of television print radio digital social mobile email direct mail and billboards at oceania the marketing message revolves around the four core brand pillars of the product award winning midsize ships finest cuisine at sea destination specialists and extraordinary value at regent the marketing message focuses on allinclusive luxury with a tagline that stretches the brand promise outside the cruise industry to encompass the entire vacation market – “the most inclusive luxury experience” both oceania and regent enhance their brand cache by partnering with other highend partners such as lalique ralph lauren home dakota jackson smithsonian institution canyon ranch bulgari and hermes given the demographics of the average oceania and regent guests the main marketing vehicles are more traditional vehicles of advertising such as brochures and direct mail but also include robust travel agency support websites email and social media

 

norwegian has made significant progress in expanding marketing reach with our online products and services including investing in our mobile site and mobile apps our website wwwnclcom  serving both our travel agency partners and guests has been a major focus of this momentum we are continually enhancing our website to ensure that we communicate brand promise promote relevant product information and align with the “cruise like a norwegian” and “freestyle cruising” messages the norwegian consumer and travel agency partner booking engine provides travel agency partners and guests the ability to shop and purchase any of the worldwide cruise itineraries with a more intuitive and informative online experience all three brands continue to develop additional functionality and tools to serve our travel agency partners and guests in fact an independent study by key lime interactive the contemporary and premium brands 2014 cruise competitive benchmark study compared seven of the top cruise brands for overall web experience and norwegian earned the top spot ranking bestinclass for overall site satisfaction 

 

for all three of our brands building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new ships and itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brands products and services and often return to cruise with us all of our brands’ loyalty programs latitudes rewards for norwegian oceania club for oceania and seven seas society for regent allow guests to earn points based on a number of factors including the number of cruise nights level of accommodations and certain booking windows our past guests receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information cruise promotions with incentives and special pricing shipboard credits and onboard recognition continued investments in the “booked guest” experience on all of our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal precruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services we have a strong “booked guest” communications stream that provides customized precruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise also avid cruisers can use the norwegian cobranded credit card to earn upgrades and discounts on that brand

 

we provide robust marketing support to our travel partners through a variety of programs at norwegian marketing headquarters is an online resource with a multitude of consumer marketing materials that agents can easily customize for their use in promoting our products both oceania and regent have similar online programs likewise all three brands have a travel agent “university” program

 





 

an online travel partner education program that includes a wide variety of courses about our ships itineraries and other selling best practices in 2014 norwegian launched norwegian central a new travel agent portal that consolidates all travel agent tools under a single platform with a single signon in order to make it easy for travel agents to do business with us norwegian central includes norwegian’s booking engine research materials marketing headquarters the university program and sales team contact information

 

guest feedback and research is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate custom research studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit feedback that helps shape future direction

 

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

  

ship maintenance and logistics 

 

sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under imo requirements reflected in chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock once in five years pending age of vessel twice in 5 years pending flag state and age of vessel and the maximum interval between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years pending age of vessel and flag state however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas andor marshall islands flag state as applicable after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work we do not earn revenue while ships are drydocked accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability

 

suppliers 

 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services fuel food and beverage travel agent services and advertising and marketing most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry

  

crew and staff 

 

bestinclass guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate particularly in the upscale segment where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality we have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests among other initiatives we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs with a focus on career development in addition to ensure that guests receive highly personalized service and attention to detail we staff oceania and regent ships to offer crew to guest ratios that range from 114 to 117 which is among the highest in the industry we believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew helping to build customer loyalty

 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in regular safety trainings exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships

 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary

 

prior to every cruise setting sail we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits

 





 

we have developed safety management systems “sms” which establish policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside sms also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through these systems our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet our sms are approved and audited annually by our classification societies det norske veritas and lloyds register and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annualsemiannual inspections by the us coast guard flag state and other port state authorities we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments

 

insurance 

 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets

 

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business the insurance we carry includes

 

  

  

  

we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels

 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the imo diplomatic conference agreed to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which took effect on april 23 2014 establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer in addition on december 31 2012 the european union “eu” passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident we believe our ships’ entries with their respective protection and indemnity associations provides the compulsory insurance however no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required

we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the “freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” other significant marks include our school of fish design marks that display one fish swimming against a school of fish we believe our “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” the names of our ships as well as the school of fish design and cruise like a norwegian logos are widely recognized throughout north america and europe and have considerable value

regulatory issues 

  

registration of our ships 

 

fifteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america is a usflagged ship five of our ships are registered in the marshall islands our ships registered in the bahamas and the marshall islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian and marshall islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government including but not limited to the food and drug administration “fda” the us coast guard and us department of labor the international national state and local laws regulations treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited

 

our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety security environmental customs immigration health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements

 

our entire fleet is also subject to the health safety security and environmental laws and regulations of the various port locales where the ships dock the us bahamas and marshall islands are members of the imo and have adopted and implemented the imo conventions relating to oceangoing passenger ships us law generally requires ships transporting passengers exclusively between and among ports in the us to be built entirely in the us documented under us law crewed by americans and owned by entities that are at least 75 owned and controlled by us citizens we have been granted specific authority to operate in and among the islands of hawaii under legislation known as the “hawaii cruise ship provision” which was part of the “consolidated appropriations resolution 2003” enacted in 2003 public law 1087 division b title ii general provisions—department of commerce section 211 february 20 2003 117 stat 1179 the hawaii cruise ship provision permitted two partially completed ships originally contracted for construction in a us shipyard by an unrelated party to be completed in a shipyard outside of the us and documented under the us flag even if the owner does not meet the 75 us ownership requirement provided that the direct owning entity is organized under the laws of the us and meets certain us citizen officer and director requirements presently only one of the two ships completed in compliance with the hawaii cruise ship provision pride of america operates as a usflagged ship the other pride of hawai’i was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian jade the hawaii cruise ship provision also authorized the redocumentation under the us flag of one additional foreignbuilt cruise ship for operation between us ports in the islands of hawaii pride of aloha in may 2008 pride of aloha was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian sky the hawaii cruise ship provision imposes certain requirements including that any nonwarranty work be performed in the us except in case of emergency or lack of availability and that the ship operates primarily between and among the islands of hawaii as a result of this exemption our usflagged ship deployed in hawaii is able to cruise between us ports in hawaii without the need to call at a foreign port

 

certain of our ships are also subject to periodic class surveys by ship classification societies including drydock inspections to verify that they have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended maintenance and required repairs have been satisfactorily completed class certification is required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships for more information on drydock work see “our business—ship operations and cruise infrastructure—ship maintenance and logistics”

 





  

health and environment 

 

our ships are subject to us and various international national state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including but not limited to marpol that govern among other things air emissions waste discharge water management and disposal and the storage handling use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals solvents and paints under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into waterways specifically in the us we comply with the us environmental protection agency’s vessel general permit “vgp” program

 

also in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements including ratings by inspectors from the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the fda we believe we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene to assist cruise lines in achieving the highest health and sanitation standards on cruise ships

 

the us act to prevent pollution from ships which implements the marpol convention provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to shipgenerated pollution for incidents in us waters within three nautical miles of land and in some cases within the 200mile exclusive economic zone

 

the us oil pollution act of 1990 “opa 90” provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200mile exclusive economic zone of the united states subject to defined monetary limits opa 90 requires that in order for us to operate in us waters we must have certificates of financial responsibility from the us coast guard for each of our ships that operate in these waters we have these certificates that demonstrate our ability to meet the maximum amount of opa 90 related liability that our ships could be subject to for removal costs and damages such as from an oil spill or a release of a hazardous substance

 

the clean water act of 1972 and other laws and regulations provide the us environmental protection agency “epa” with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water bilge water gray water antifouling paints and other substances during normal operations within the us three mile territorial zone and inland waters the us national pollutant discharge elimination system was designed to minimize pollution within us territorial waters for our affected ships all of the requirements are laid out in the vgp which is an epa requirement the vgp establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel in addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements the vgp includes requirements for inspections monitoring reporting and recordkeeping

 

pursuant to the federal maritime commission “fmc” and us coast guard regulations we have covered our financial responsibility with respect to death or injury to passengers and water pollution by providing required guarantees from our insurers with respect to such potential liabilities this includes obtaining certificates of financial responsibility required by the us coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liabilities in cases of water pollution

 

most us states that border navigable waterways or sea coasts have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance these laws may be more stringent than us federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability the state of alaska enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated alaskan waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the standards established by the legislation the state environmental regimes in alaska are more stringent than the federal regime under the federal water pollution control act with regard to discharge from vessels the legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in alaskan waters

 

the eu has adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment to support the implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation the eu has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement and a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections the european commission’s “ec” strategy is to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships the ec strategy seeks to implement sulfur oxides emission control areas “ecas” set out in marpol as discussed below in addition the ec goes beyond the imo by introducing requirements to use low sulfur less than 01 marine gas oil in eu ports

 

marpol specifies requirements for ecas with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas ships operating in the baltic sea eca the north seaenglish channel eca the north american eca and the area which extends approximately 50 miles off the coasts of puerto rico and the us virgin islands are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 01 or use alternative emission reduction methods provided the alternatives are at least as effective in terms of emissions reductions other additional ecas may also be established in the future such as for areas around australia hong kong japan the mediterranean sea and mexico

 

the marpol global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ecas will be reduced to 05 from the current 35 global limit on and after january 2020 the 05 global standard will be subject to an imo review by 2018 to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard taking into account the global fuel oil market supply and demand an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and any other relevant issues if the imo determines that there is insufficient fuel to comply with the 05 standard in january 2020 then this requirement will be delayed to january 2025 at the latest however the european union parliament and council have set

 





 

2020 as the final date for the 05 fuel sulfur limit to enter force regardless of the 2018 imo review results this european union sulfur directive will cover european union member state territorial waters that are within 12 nautical miles of their coastline we believe that compliance with the 05 global standard could significantly increase our fuel costs however the magnitude of this increase is not reasonably determinable at this time due to the length of time until the global standard becomes effective and the other potential mitigating factors discussed below the cost impacts from implementing progressively lower sulfur content requirements may be mitigated by the favorable impact of future changes in the supply and demand balance for marine and other fuels future developments of and investments in sulfur emission abatement and propulsion technologies including more advanced engines more effective hull coatings and paints exhaust gas cleaning systems propeller design more efficient shipboard systems and the use of alternative lowercost and loweremission fuels such as liquefied natural gas both at sea and in port

 

recently adopted amendments to marpol will make the baltic sea a “special area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be restricted stricter discharge restrictions are currently in effect for new passenger ships whose construction began after january 1 2016 and for existing passenger ships starting in 2018 the underlying requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed accordingly the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time however we do not expect it to be material

 

in addition to the existing legal requirements we are committed to helping to preserve the environment because a clean unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships in 2012 norwegian received its international organization for standardization’s “iso” 90012008 certification which is the primary globally accepted standard for quality assurance and quality performance this is a milestone which sets the stage for quality operations and guest satisfaction furthermore norwegian is certified under the iso 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management plan that is incorporated into the sems program

 

if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws regulations or treaties we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws regulations and treaties any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations cash flow or financial condition

 

permits for glacier bay alaska 

 

in connection with certain of our alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future

 

security and safety 

 

the imo has adopted safety standards as part of solas which apply to all of our ships solas establishes requirements for vessel design structural features construction methods and materials refurbishment standards lifesaving equipment fire protection and detection safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew all of our crew undergo regular safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations

 

solas requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” we have obtained certificates certifying that our ships are in compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification

 

the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 and provides for measures strengthening maritime security and places new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports

 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us and docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships the transportation workers identification credential is a federal requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships

 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems by december 31 2005

 





 

imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction all of our ships are in compliance with the solas amendment the new solas regulation on longrange identification and tracking entered into force on january 1 2008

 

maritimelabor 

 

in 2006 the international labor organization “ilo” an agency of the united nations that develops and oversees international labor standards adopted a new consolidated maritime labor convention “mlc 2006” mlc 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor conventions and recommendations adopted by the ilo since 1920 mlc 2006 includes a broad range of requirements such as a broader definition of a seafarer minimum age of seafarers medical certificates recruitment practices training repatriation food recreational facilities health and welfare hours of work and rest accommodations wages and entitlements mlc 2006 added requirements not previously in effect in the areas of occupational safety and health mlc 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing august 2013 the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” as amended establishes minimum standards relating to training certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers

 

financial requirements 

 

the fmc requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly each of our three brands are required to maintain a 220 million thirdparty performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers recent regulations have revised the financial requirements with respect to both deathinjury and nonperformance coverages to increase the current 220 million performance guarantee to 300 million effective april 2 2015 once fully effective in april 2015 the guarantee requirements will be subject to additional consumer price indexbased adjustments we do not anticipate that compliance with the new rules will have a material effect on our costs also each of our brands have a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the uk and accordingly have established separate bonds with the association of british travel agents currently valued at british pound sterling 80 million in the aggregate we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions

 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general

 

for information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements see part i item 1arisk factors in this annual report on form 10k including the risk factor titled “we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue”

 

taxation 

  

us income taxation 

 

the following discussion is based upon current provisions of the internal revenue code the “code” us treasury regulations administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below

  

exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code 

 

under section 883 of the code and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its us source income derived from the international operation of ships “shipping income” if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 of the code and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by qualified shareholders which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” a “cfc” for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50 of its stock is owned by qualified us persons for more than half of the taxable year the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements

 

nclh is incorporated in bermuda a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption and nclh meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on the nasdaq global select market which is considered

 





 

to be an established securities market in the united states therefore we believe that nclh qualifies for the benefits of section 883 of the code

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of nclh’s income including the income of its shipowning subsidiaries is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under section 883 of the code there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares including as a result of the acquisition of prestige which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under section 883 of the code further any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

under certain circumstances changes in the identity residence or holdings of nclh’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause nclh’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under section 883 of the code therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our abilility to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person other than the sponsors from owning directly indirectly or constructively more than 49 of nclh’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by nclh’s board of directors the “49 limit” any outstanding shares held in excess of the 49 limit will be transferred to and held in a trust

 

for us federal income tax purposes regent and its nonus subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent pch and oceania is treated as a corporation for 2014 both regent and oceania relied on pch’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of section 883 of the code pch is organized as a company in panama which grants an equivalent tax exemption to us corporations and is thus classified as a qualified foreign country for purposes of section 883 of the code pch was classified as a cfc for the taxable year ended december 31 2014 and we believe pch meets the ownership and substantiation requirements of the cfc test under the regulations for that year

  

taxation of international shipping income where section 883 of the code is inapplicable 

  

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the us if we fail to qualify for the exemption under section 883 of the code in respect of our us sourced shipping income we will be subject to taxation in the us on such income

 

generally “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as “us source shipping income” will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us

 

if we do not qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate and state and local taxes and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 unless a lower treaty rate applies the “net tax regime” our us source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have or are considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of our us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us

 

if we do not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income in that case we would be subject to a special 4 tax on our us source shipping income the “4 tax regime”

  

other united states taxation 

 

us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes under the net tax regime discussed above income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and pre and postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income

  





  

income from usflagged operation under the ncl america brand 

  

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels we expect that such income will not be subject to us branch profits tax nor a us dividend withholding tax under the usuk income tax treaty

  

uk income taxation 

  

as a result of a restructuring nclh and nclc became tax residents of the uk and are subject to normal uk corporation tax

  

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

  

gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under section 883 of the code provided nclh qualifies for exemption from tax under section 883 of the code in respect of our shipping income if however our gain does not qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 tax regime

  

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

  

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

changes in tax laws 

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 of the code and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the united states moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the usuk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our usflagged operation

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 2700 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 22200 shipboard employees prestige ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard we refer you to “risk factors—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place

  

ports and facilities 

 

we have an agreement with the government of bermuda whereby two of our ships are permitted weekly calls in bermuda through 2018 from boston baltimore charleston and new york in addition we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on certain itineraries we have a contract with the new york city economic development corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights at the manhattan cruise terminal furthermore we have contracts with the port of new orleans and the port of miami pursuant to which we receive preferential berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals in addition we have agreements with similar rights in port canaveral fl and the port of tampa we have an agreement with the houston port authority through april 15 2017 for certain exclusive berthing rights at the houston passenger cruise terminal we have a concession permit with the us national park service whereby our ships are permitted to call on glacier bay during each summer cruise season through september 30 2019 most recently we entered into an agreement with the british virgin islands port authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15year term with two options to extend the agreement for additional five year terms

  

segment reporting 

 

we have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment each brand oceania regent and norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and therefore

 





 

each brand is considered an operating segment our operating segments have similar economic characteristics including similar margins and similar products and services therefore we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment

 

although we sell cruises on an international basis our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to guests who make reservations in north america revenue attributable to north american guests was 801 799 and 805 for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively substantially all of our long–lived assets are located outside of the us and consist primarily of our ships

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” 

  

risks related to the acquisition of prestige 

  

significant costs have been incurred in connection with the consummation of the acquisition of prestige and are expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of prestige into our business including legal accounting financial advisory and other costs 

 

significant costs have been incurred and will be incurred in connection with integrating the operations products and personnel of prestige into our business in addition to costs related directly to completing the acquisition of prestige these costs may include costs for

 

• employee retention redeployment relocation or severance

 

• integration of information systems

 

• combination of corporate and administrative functions and processes and

 

• maintenance and management of our fleet

 

in addition we have incurred a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining our operations with those of prestige although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of

 





 

our operations with those of prestige may offset incremental transaction and transactionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all

 

in addition we incurred and assumed new indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of prestige this debt may limit our financial and operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt which could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness our substantial indebtedness has had and will continue to have material consequences for our business financial condition and results of operations

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of prestige 

  

the acquisition of prestige involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently the integration of our operations with those of prestige is expected to result in financial and operational benefits including increased revenue and cost savings there can be no assurance however regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these increased revenue cost savings or other benefits integration may also be difficult unpredictable and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps we must integrate or in some cases replace numerous systems including those involving management information purchasing accounting and finance sales billing employee benefits payroll data privacy and security and regulatory compliance many of which may be dissimilar difficulties associated with integration could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

in connection with the acquisition of prestige we assumed certain liabilities relating to prestige’s business 

  

in connection with the acquisition of prestige we have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to prestige’s business to the extent we have not identified such liabilities or to the extent the indemnifications obtained from the other parties to the merger agreement for the acquisition of prestige are insufficient to cover known liabilities these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

integrating prestige’s business into our business may divert our management’s attention away from operations 

  

successful integration of prestige’s operations products and personnel may place a significant burden on our management and other internal resources the diversion of management’s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

as a result of the acquisition of prestige we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and require us to incur substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel 

 

as a result of the acquisition of prestige our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles this uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highquality employees any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

risks related to the company 

  

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as fluctuating or increasing levels of unemployment underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in north america or globally such as the volatility of fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher unemployment or underemployment rates higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests consequently this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries which are a discretionary purchase decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting which in turn could reduce the profitability of our business in addition these conditions could also impact our suppliers which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increases in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies may change because some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies we are exposed to exchange rate risks we

 





 

have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros while we have entered into foreign currency swaps and collar options to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged additionally if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated additional risks include interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers restrictions on repatriation of earnings withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes if we are unable to address these risks adequately our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

operating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible if our employees or agents violate our policies if we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties

  

changes in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations 

 

fuel expense accounted for 168 of our total cruise operating expense for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 183 and 192 for the same periods in 2013 and 2012 respectively future increases in the cost of fuel globally would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control despite any fuel hedges we are currently a party to or may enter into in the future increases in fuel prices or other cruise operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests

  

our efforts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 

 

we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets such as europe and australia as well as into emerging markets in the asia pacific region and may undertake such expansion efforts at any time in the future expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments 

 

our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition operations prospects and flexibility our substantial indebtedness could

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  





 

   

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs

  

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder

 

  

  

  

such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness

 

if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full

  

despite our substantial indebtedness we may still be able to incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness at any time in the future although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things

 





 

  

  

there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that we will be able to borrow additional amounts under our existing debt agreements or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs

 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on numerous factors including but not limited to the condition of the capital markets our financial condition at such time credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources sufficient to service our debt we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations some or all of our assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value however and we may not be able to consummate such dispositions for fair market value or at all furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due neither our sponsors nor any of their respective affiliates has any continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing

 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness include and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may include exceptions to certain covenants that permit us to incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments and take other actions

  

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all economic downturns including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis can disrupt the capital and credit markets such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument

  

terrorist acts acts of piracy armed conflict and threats thereof and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

 

past acts of terrorism and piracy have had an adverse effect on tourism travel and the availability of air service and other forms of transportation the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility thereof an increase in the activity of pirates operating off the western coast of africa or elsewhere political unrest and instability the issuance of travel advisories by national governments and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability

  

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of viral illnesses stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises and result in cruise cancellations and employee absenteeism if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected

 

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

 

the majority of our guests book their cruises through independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators in the event that these distribution channels are adversely impacted by an economic downturn or by other factors this could reduce the distribution channels

 





 

available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels we are not accustomed to if this were to occur it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 

additionally independent travel agents wholesalers and tour operators generally sell and market our cruises on a nonexclusive basis although we offer commissions and other incentives to them for booking our cruises there can be no guarantee that our competitors will not offer higher commissions and incentives in the future travel agents may face increasing pressure from our competitors particularly in the north american market to sell and market our competitors’ cruises exclusively if such exclusive arrangements were introduced there can be no assurances that we will be able to find alternative distribution channels to ensure that our customer base would not be affected

  

we rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain of our ships and certain other services and we are exposed to risks facing such providers in certain circumstances we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us 

 

we rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain of our ships and certain other services that are vital to our business if these service providers suffer financial hardship or are otherwise unable to continue providing such services we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner which may cause an interruption in our operations to the extent that we are able to replace such service providers we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the thirdparty service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations

  

delays in our shipbuilding program and ship repairs maintenance and refurbishments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the new construction refurbishment repair and maintenance of our cruise ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction refurbishment and repair projects our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair if there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment such as the radar a pod propulsion unit the electricalpower management system the steering gear or the gyro system

 

in addition availability work stoppages insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction refurbishment or repair of our ships or other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business the consolidation of the control of certain european cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for refurbishment and repairs due to reduced competition also the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis these potential events and the associated losses to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base or disrupt our operations 

 

a number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices fuel surcharges changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our cruise ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which would in turn have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

  

our revenue is seasonal owing to variations in passenger fare rates and occupancy levels at different times of the year we may not be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses during certain periods of the year 

 

the demand for our cruises is seasonal with greatest demand for cruises generally occurring during the summer months this seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for drydocks which we typically schedule during offpeak demand periods for such ships accordingly seasonality in demand and drydock periods could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses we incur during certain periods of the year

  

adverse incidents involving cruise ships and our ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 





 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased portrelated and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant accident mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship we may have to place a ship in an extended drydock period for repairs this could result in material lost revenue andor expenditures

 

there can be no assurance that all risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage or coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected moreover irrespective of the occurrence of such events there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all

  

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations disruptions to these networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand in addition certain networks are dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability among other things actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes fires floods or similar events information systems failures computer viruses denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks may cause disruptions to our information technology telecommunications and other networks while we have and continue to invest in business continuity disaster recovery and data restoration plans we cannot completely insulate ourselves from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results we carry limited business interruption insurance for certain of our shoreside operations subject to limitations exclusions and deductibles

 

we have also made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our websites and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation if our security systems were breached we could be exposed to cyberrelated risks and malware and credit card and other sensitive data could be at risk

 

in the event of a data security breach of our systems andor thirdparty systems we may incur costs associated with the following breach response notification forensics regulatory investigations public relations consultants credit identity monitoring credit freezes fraud alert credit identity restoration credit card cancellation credit card reissuance or replacement regulatory fines and penalties vendor fines and penalties legal fees and damages denial of service attacks may result in costs associated with among other things the following response forensics public relations consultants data restoration legal fees and settlement in addition data security breaches or denial of service attacks may cause business interruption information technology disruption disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data damage to our reputation damages to intangible property and other intangible damages such as loss of consumer confidence all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results while we have and continue to invest in data and information technology security initiatives we cannot completely insulate ourselves from the risks of data security breaches and denial of service attacks that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results

  

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 

 

our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology these systems and technologies must be refined updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train

 





 

our employees to operate any of these new systems our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology such as fuel abatement technologies and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results

  

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

 

currently we are a party to six collective bargaining agreements three of these agreements are in effect through 2017 of the three remaining agreements two are scheduled to expire in 2018 and one is scheduled to expire in 2020 upon appropriate notice these agreements may be reopened at certain threeyear intervals and we received notice from two of the parties to reopen wagebenefit negotiations in 2015 these negotiations are scheduled for a completion date of april 1 2015 any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition although our collective bargaining agreements have a nostrike provision they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

  

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports including the specific port facility at which our guests will embark and disembark is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security safety and environmental concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development political instability exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors local governmental regulations and fees local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists and sanctions programs implemented by the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department or other regulatory bodies any limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

  

litigation enforcement actions fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation 

 

our business is subject to various us and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions fines civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages in addition improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation andor lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 

as a result of any shiprelated or other incidents litigation claims enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations including but not limited to those arising from personal injury loss of life loss of or damage to personal property business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area may be asserted or brought against various parties including us andor our cruise brands the time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims actions and investigations subject to applicable insurance coverage we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims actions and investigations and for any judgments fines civil or criminal penalties if such claims actions or investigations are adversely determined

  

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

  

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 of the code based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—taxation” the provisions of section 883 of the code are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect

 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly traded test under section 883 of the code as described in “item 1—business— taxation—exemption of international shipping income under section 883 of the code” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our

 





 

operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation” and we can give no assurances on this matter

 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 of the code our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— taxation as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly traded test imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership or publically traded tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—taxation”

 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial

 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 of the code and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the united states moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation

  

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

 

some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual states are considering as well as implementing new laws and rules to manage cruise ship waste in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol an international environmental regulation and stcw and its conventions in ship manning international regulations regarding ballast water and security levels are currently pending

 

additionally the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies such as requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations in 2006 alaskan voters approved a ballot measure requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” pursuant to the ballot measure alaska approved stringent regulations and required a waste water discharge permit for cruise ships beginning in 2008 legislation approved in 2009 allowed the state to issue general permits that contain effluent limits or standards that are less stringent than the wqs where the ship is using economically feasible methods of pollution prevention in 2013 the state extended the permit program and allowed ship operators to apply for mixing zones in upcoming permits an option that may ease compliance with certain wqs the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 the convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crew members marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands have been included as of january 2014 are generally expected to meet the new emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels

 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future

 

by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues”

 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new

 





 

taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises

 

risks related to nclh’s ordinary shares 

  

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of nasdaq and as a result rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 

 

on january 18 2013 nclh listed its ordinary shares on the nasdaq global select market and genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds or their respective affiliates together continue to control a majority of its ordinary shares as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of nasdaq under the rules of nasdaq a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirement

 

  

  

  

  

nclh has utilized some of these exemptions as a result nclh does not have a majority of independent directors nor is nclh required to have any independent directors on its nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees and nclh is not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees accordingly its shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to a national securities exchange’s general corporate governance requirements without giving effect to the “controlled company” exemptions of nasdaq

 

nclh is controlled by the sponsors who hold a significant percentage of nclh’s ordinary shares and whose interests may not be aligned with ours or that of our other security holders 

 

the majority of nclh’s voting ordinary shares are held by affiliates of genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds the shareholders’ agreement governing the relationship among those parties gives the apollo funds effective control over our affairs and policies subject to certain limitations genting hk and the apollo funds also control the election of nclh’s board of directors the appointment of management the entering into of mergers sales of substantially all of our assets and other material transactions the directors appointed by genting hk and the apollo funds have the authority on our behalf and subject to the terms of our debt agreements and the shareholders’ agreement to issue additional ordinary shares implement share repurchase programs declare dividends pay advisory fees and make other decisions and they may have an interest in our doing so the interests of genting hk the apollo funds and other funds affiliated with apollo and the tpg viking funds could conflict with our interests and the interests of our other security holders in material respects

 

furthermore genting hk engages in the cruise industry and leisure entertainment and hospitality activities and apollo and tpg are in the business of managing investment funds which make investments in companies one or more of which has now and may from time to time hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us as well as businesses that represent major guests of our business investment funds managed by genting hk apollo andor tpg may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as nclh’s sponsors continue to control a significant amount of its outstanding voting ordinary shares such shareholders will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions additionally the concentration of ownership held by nclh’s sponsors could delay defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger takeover or other business combination

  

shareholders of nclh may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as shareholders of a us corporation 

 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to nclh differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of nclh’s byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of nclh than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or nclh’s byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers

  





  

nclh does not have current plans to pay dividends on its ordinary shares 

 

nclh does not currently intend to pay dividends to its shareholders and nclh’s board of directors may never declare a dividend our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of nclh’s subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and nclh’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of nclh’s board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that nclh’s board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition nclh is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to nclh to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase nclh’s ordinary shares

  

provisions in nclh’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that nclh’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

 

nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent nclh’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of nclh’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of nclh’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include subject to the shareholders’ agreement

 

  

  

  

  

  

additionally nclh’s byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of nclh’s board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions as well as the significant ownership of ordinary shares by our sponsors may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in nclh in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares

in may 2011 a class action complaint was filed against ncl bahamas ltd in the united states district court southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of crew members alleging inappropriate deductions of their wages pursuant to the seaman’s wage act and breach of contract in july 2012 this action was stayed by the court pending the outcome of the litigation commenced with the class action complaint filed in july 2009 the matter was resolved at the court ordered mediation in conjunction with the matter described above

 

in the normal course of our business various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

financial presentation 

  

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the summer months

 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services photo services as well as charter revenue we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue

 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies

  

ship accounting 

 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred

 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2014 would have

 





 

increased by 73 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 365 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage

  

asset impairment 

 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates judgments and projections considered necessary the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved

 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets principally tradenames are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered

 

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge as of december 31 2014 our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets

  

contingencies 

 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

  

nongaap financial measures 

 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue adjusted net revenue net yield adjusted net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted eps to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definition of these nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance

 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of north america a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly euro and british pound sterling which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business

 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining the company’s performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of the company’s business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments

 





 

in addition adjusted net income and adjusted eps are nongaap financial measures that exclude certain charges and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance and we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance the charges excluded in the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted eps may vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results

 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section

  

summary of significant 2014 events 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

the acquisition of prestige is expected to positively impact passenger ticket revenue and to a lesser extent onboard and other revenue from the addition of prestige’s eight ships which command premium pricing as a result of their upper premium and luxury product offerings

  

executive overview 

 

total revenue increased 216 to 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 26 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 net revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 250 to 24 billion from 19 billion in the same period in 2013 with an improvement in both net yield of 43 and capacity days of 198

 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we had net income attributable to nclh and diluted eps of 3384 million and 162 respectively operating income increased 270 to 5029 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 3959 million for the year ended december 31 2013

 

we had adjusted net income and adjusted eps of 4806 million and 227 respectively for the year ended december 31 2014 which includes 1380 million of adjustments primarily consisting of 575 million of expenses related to the acquisition of prestige 283 million of expenses related to noncash compensation 154 million of expenses related to financing transactions in conjunction with the acquisition of prestige 130 million related to the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue and 126 million related to the amortization of intangible assets a 356 improvement in adjusted ebitda was achieved for the same period primarily due to the increase in net income we refer you to our “results of operations” below for a calculation of net revenue net yield adjusted net income adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda

revenue 

 

total revenue increased 216 to 31 billion in 2014 compared to 26 billion in 2013 net revenue increased 250 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in capacity days of 198 the increase in capacity days was primarily due to the delivery of norwegian breakaway in april 2013 and norwegian getaway in january 2014 the net yield improvement of 43 was due to higher net ticket and net onboard and other revenue adjusted net revenue excludes a deferred revenue fair value adjustment of 101 million related to the acquisition of prestige the improvement in adjusted net yield was primarily the result of a 33 increase in norwegian standalone net yield 32 on a constant currency basis and partially due to the addition of prestige’s brands to the fleet

  

expense 

 

total cruise operating expense increased 174 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the increase in capacity days as discussed above total other operating expense increased 309 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to transaction expenses related to the acquisition of prestige and certain inaugural and launchrelated costs for norwegian getaway and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the addition of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway on a capacity day basis net cruise cost increased 36 due to the increase in expenses explained above partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense the fuel price per metric ton excluding the impact of hedges was 605 in 2014 compared to 686 in 2013 we experienced a negative impact in 2014 of 103 million on our hedge portfolio due to recent reductions in fuel prices compared to a benefit of 47 million in 2013 net of hedges fuel price per metric ton decreased to 625 in 2014 compared to 675 in 2013 the company’s fuel consumption per capacity day decreased 31 on a capacity day basis net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 78 primarily due to costs related to the acquisition of prestige and certain general and administrative costs and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day

 





 

increased 35 adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel was relatively unchanged on a norwegian standalone constant currency basis

 

interest expense net decreased to 1518 million in 2014 from 2826 million in 2013 interest expense net for 2014 reflected an increase in average debt outstanding associated with newbuild financings and debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of prestige partially offset by lower interest rates from the benefits from the redemption of higher rate debt and refinancing transactions in addition 2014 reflects 154 million of expenses related to financing transactions in conjunction with the acquisition of prestige while 2013 reflects 1606 million of expenses associated with debt prepayments

 

in 2014 we had an income tax benefit of 23 million compared to an income tax expense of 118 million for 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed the implementation of a global tax platform which had a favorable impact on the amount of income subject to us corporate tax this favorable impact continued through calendar year 2014 in addition during the first quarter of 2014 we received information which allowed us to elect a tax method to calculate deductible interest expense which resulted in a tax benefit of 111 million including a 53 million nonrecurring benefit

 

year ended december 31 2013 “2013” compared to year ended december 31 2012 “2012” 

  

revenue 

 

total revenue increased 129 to 26 billion in 2013 compared to 23 billion in 2012 net revenue increased 134 in 2013 primarily due to an increase in capacity days of 88 related to the delivery of norwegian breakaway and an increase in net yield of 43 the increase in net yield was due to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and higher onboard and other revenue partially due to the introduction of norwegian breakaway to the fleet on a constant currency basis net yield increased 42 in 2013 compared to 2012

 

expense 

 

total cruise operating expense increased 121 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in capacity days expenses related to planned drydocks and fuel expense partially offset by the timing of certain expenses the increase in fuel expense was primarily the result of a 17 increase in the average fuel price to 675 per metric ton in 2013 from 664 in 2012 total other operating expense increased 173 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to noncash expenses related to sharebased compensation recognized upon the realization of our ipo the timing of certain expenses and depreciation expense related to the addition of norwegian breakaway on a capacity day basis net cruise cost increased 50 on an as reported and 48 on a constant currency basis due to the expenses discussed above adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 36 and 34 on an as reported and constant currency basis respectively mainly due to the timing of certain expenses

 

interest expense net increased to 2826 million in 2013 from 1899 million in 2012 primarily due to 1606 million of expenses associated with debt prepayments partially offset by lower interest rates resulting from the benefits from the redemption of higher rate debt and refinancing transactions

 

income tax expense increased to 118 million in 2013 from 07 million in 2012 primarily due to the change in our us tax status from a partnership to a corporation in connection with our ipo

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

 

as of december 31 2014 our liquidity was 5098 million consisting of 848 million in cash and cash equivalents and 4250 million available under our revolving credit facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

 

as of december 31 2014 we had a working capital deficit of 18 billion this deficit included 8172 million of advance ticket sales which represents the total revenue we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our revolving credit facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs

 

our existing debt agreements restrict and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations

 





    

sources and uses of cash 

  

in this section references to 2014 refer to the year ended december 31 2014 references to 2013 refer to the year ended december 31 2013 and references to 2012 refer to the year ended december 31 2012 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 6356 million in 2014 compared to 4753 million in 2013 and 3986 million in 2012 the change in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 reflects net income in 2014 of 3426 million compared to net income in 2013 of 1029 million as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities the net income in 2013 included fees of 1242 million related to prepayment of debt and 114 million of deferred income taxes the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities primarily with an increase in advance ticket sales the 2012 balance included net income of 1686 million and 60 million related to the premium received from the issuance of 1000 million of senior unsecured notes

 

net cash used in investing activities was 19 billion in 2014 primarily due to payments related to i the acquisition of prestige ii the delivery of norwegian getaway and iii our breakaway plus class ships and other ship improvements and shoreside projects net cash used in investing activities was 8949 million in 2013 primarily related to the payments for construction and delivery of norwegian breakaway and construction of norwegian getaway as well as other ship improvements and shoreside projects net cash used in investing activities was 3038 million in 2012 primarily related to payments for construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway the purchase of norwegian sky and other ship improvements and shoreside projects

 

net cash provided by financing activities was 13 billion in 2014 primarily due to borrowings of an incremental 7000 million under our 13750 million term loan facility an additional 3500 million on our 3500 million senior secured term loan facility and borrowings under the breakaway two loan and credit facilities related to our breakaway plus class ships partially offset by repayments of our revolving credit facility and other borrowings in november 2014 we also issued the 6800 million 525 senior unsecured notes net cash provided by financing activities was 4305 million in 2013 primarily due to the issuance of our 3000 million 5 senior unsecured notes as well as borrowings under other credit facilities and the proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares partially offset by repayments of our 4500 million 1175 senior secured notes and revolving credit facilities and a payment related to the norwegian sky purchase agreement net cash used in financing activities was 1082 million in 2012 primarily due to repayments of our revolving credit facilities other borrowings and loan arrangement fees which were partially offset by borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and by the issuance of 1000 million of senior unsecured notes

  

future capital commitments 

 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including future expected capital expenditures for business enhancements and ship construction contracts as of december 31 2014 anticipated capital expenditures together with amounts for ship construction and related export credit financing were as follows in thousands based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014

 

  

 

   

we have orders with meyer werft for four breakaway plus class ships for delivery in the fall of 2015 spring of 2017 spring of 2018 and fall of 2019 these ships will be the largest in our fleet reaching approximately 164600 gross tons and up to 4200 berths each and will be similar in design and innovation to our breakaway class ships the combined contract price of these four ships is approximately €30 billion or 36 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of their contract prices we also have a contract with italy’s fincantieri shipyard to build a luxury cruise ship to be named seven seas explorer the contract price of the ship is approximately €3430 million or approximately 4150 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of the ship’s contract price seven seas explorer will be delivered in summer of 2016

 





 

in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 220 million 263 million and 221 million respectively primarily associated with the construction of our newbuild ships

  

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

none

  

contractual obligations 

 

as of december 31 2014 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands

 

  

 

        

the table above does not include 112 million of unrecognized tax benefits we refer you to the notes to the consolidated financial statements note—11 “income tax”

  

other 

 

certain of our service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions

 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities

  

funding sources 

 

our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends our ships and substantially all other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2014

 





 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets has created a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted

 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional equity will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations

  




 item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

  

general 

 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses

  

interest rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2014 we had interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2014 53 of our debt was fixed and 47 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swaps the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2014 was 13 billion based on our december 31 2014 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 289 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

as of december 31 2014 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the final payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €26 billion or 31 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2014 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2014 would result in a 3163 million change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments

  

fuel price risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 168 183 and 192 for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2014 we had hedged approximately 68 55 39 and 8 of our 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2015 fuel expense by 228 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements of 130 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

corporate reorganization 

in february 2011 nclh a bermuda limited company was formed with the issuance to the sponsors of in aggregate 10000 ordinary shares with a par value of 001 per share on january 24 2013 we completed our ipo in connection with the consummation of the ipo the sponsors’ ordinary shares in nclc were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” prior to the corporate reorganization which was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure nclh had not conducted any activities other than those incidental to the formation and to prepare for the corporate reorganization and ipo 

nclc is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the terms of the partnership including the economic rights with respect thereto are set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for nclc economic interests in nclc are represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement which we refer to as “ncl corporation units” the ncl corporation units held by nclh as a result of its ownership of 100 of the ordinary shares of nclc represent a 978 economic interest in nclc as of december 31 2013 

in connection with the corporate reorganization nclc’s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management or former management of nclc were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of ncl corporation units we refer to the ncl corporation units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as management ncl corporation units the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests are subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged the management ncl corporation units issued in exchange for the profits interests represent a 22 economic interest in nclc as of december 31 2013 

  

ncl corporation units are not transferrable without nclh’s prior consent and do not entitle the holders to any voting preemptive or sinking fund rights any distributions other than the tax distributions described below made by nclc are allocated on a pro rata basis to nclh and the holders of the management ncl corporation units based upon the total number of ncl corporation units including management ncl corporation units outstanding distributions by nclc to nclh or holders of management ncl corporation units do not entitle holders of ordinary shares of nclh to any portion of such distribution or to any additional distribution by nclh 

nclc does not have any current plans to make any distributions other than tax distributions which may occur in the future to the extent funds are legally available nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holder the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh 

holders of ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units prior to exchange for ordinary shares of nclh as described below may be entitled to recover on account of the economic interest represented by those units in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event of nclc or nclh even if nclh incurs debt or other claims that are senior to its ordinary shares in contrast the rights of the holders of nclh’s ordinary shares will be potentially junior to the debt or senior claims if any incurred by nclh in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event in this respect the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units may be considered in some cases to be potentially structurally superior to those of the holders of ordinary shares of nclh in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event for nclh and nclc 

subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units has the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for ordinary shares of nclh at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events any nonpro rata tax distributions made to a management ncl corporation unit holder will reduce the amount of nclh’s ordinary shares or cash that the holder would otherwise receive upon exchange the exchange right described above is subject to i the filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement by nclh that in its determination contains all the information which is required to effect a registered sale of its ordinary shares and ii all applicable legal and contractual restrictions nclh has reserved for issuance a number of its ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units outstanding on august 19 2013 nclh filed a registration statement with the sec which is effective to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elected or will elect to exchange 

when any holder of a management ncl corporation unit exchanges such unit for one of nclh’s ordinary shares or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares the relative economic interests of the exchanging ncl corporation unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of nclh will not be altered no new nclc profits interests or management ncl corporation units will be issued however nclh has granted and expects to continue to grant options to acquire its ordinary shares to our management team under its new longterm incentive plan 

as a result of the corporate reorganization a noncontrolling interest was created within nclh and nclh’s financial statements and financial results will differ from nclc’s in certain respects

leading global cruise line operator offering cruise experiences for travelers with a wide variety of itineraries in north america including alaska and hawaii the mediterranean the baltic central america bermuda and the caribbean we strive to offer an innovative and differentiated cruise vacation with the goal of providing our guests the highest levels of overall satisfaction on their cruise experience in turn we aim to generate the highest guest loyalty and greatest numbers of repeat guests we created a distinctive style of cruising called “freestyle cruising” onboard all of our ships which we believe provides our guests with the freedom and flexibility associated with a resort style atmosphere and experience as well as more dining options than a traditional cruise we established the very first private island developed by a cruise line in the bahamas with a diverse offering of activities for guests we are also the only cruise line operator to offer an entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii 

by providing such a distinctive experience and appealing combination of value and service we straddle both the contemporary and premium segments as a result we have been recognized for our achievements as the recipient of multiple honorary awards mainly consisting of reviews tabulated from the readers of travel periodicals such as travel weekly condé nast traveler and travel  leisure we have been recognized as “europe’s leading cruise line” six years in a row as well as both “caribbean’s leading cruise line” and “world’s leading large ship cruise line” by the world travel awards norwegian breakaway which was launched in 2013 has been named “best new ship” by the editors of cruise critic and “best rookie cruise ship” by the readers of travel weekly 

we offer a wide variety of cruises ranging in length from one day to three weeks during 2013 we docked at 114 ports worldwide with itineraries originating from 18 ports of which nine are in north america in line with our strategy of innovation many of these north american ports are part of our “homeland cruising” program in which we have homeports that are close to major population centers such as new york boston and miami this reduces the need for vacationers to fly to distant ports to embark on a cruise and helps reduce our guests’ overall vacation cost we offer a wide selection of exotic itineraries outside of the traditional cruising markets of the caribbean and mexico these include cruises in europe including the mediterranean and the baltic bermuda alaska and the industry’s only entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii with our usflagged ship pride of america this itinerary is unparalleled in the cruise industry as all other vessels from competing cruise lines are registered outside the us and are required to dock at a distant foreign port when providing their guests with a hawaiibased cruise itinerary 

each of our 13 modern ships has been purposebuilt to consistently deliver our “freestyle cruising” product offering across our entire fleet which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage by focusing on “freestyle cruising” we have been able to achieve higher onboard spend levels greater customer loyalty and the ability to attract a more diverse clientele 

as a result of our strong operating performance the growing demand we see for our distinctive cruise offering and the rational supply outlook for the industry we added new ships to our fleet in 2010 we launched a newbuild program for the next generation of freestyle cruising vessels we placed an order with meyer werft for two new cruise ships norwegian breakaway which was delivered in april 2013 and norwegian getaway which was delivered in january 2014 these ships are approximately 144000 gross tons with 4000 berths 

we also have orders with meyer werft for two additional ships for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2017 these ships norwegian escape and norwegian bliss will be the largest in our fleet at approximately 163000 gross tons with 4200 berths each and will be similar in design and innovation to our breakaway class ships the combined contract cost of these two additional ships is approximately €14 billion or 19 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2013 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of their contract price as of january 31 2014 we have the youngest fleet among the major north american cruise brands as norwegian getaway joins norwegian breakaway as the latest generation of “freestyle cruising” ships and these ships include some of the most popular elements of our recently delivered ships together with new and differentiated features 

our senior management team has delivered consistent growth and has driven measurable improvements in operating metrics and cash flow generation across several different operating environments under the leadership of our president and chief executive officer kevin m sheehan we significantly differentiated the norwegian brand largely with the “freestyle cruising” concept that accelerated revenue growth and contributed to improving our operating income margins by approximately 1350 basis points since the beginning of 2008 through the end of 2013 our management team was augmented in key areas such as sales marketing hotel operations and finance and has since implemented major initiatives such as enhancing onboard service and amenities across the fleet expanding our european presence and overseeing a newbuild program that included the successful launches in april 2013 and january 2014 of our most innovative ships to date norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway 

  

our industry 

we believe that the cruise industry demonstrates the following positive fundamentals 

strong growth with low penetration and significant upside 

cruising is a vacation alternative with broad appeal as it offers a wide range of products and services to suit the preferences of vacationing guests of all ages backgrounds and interests cruising has been one of the fastest growing segments of the north american vacation market according to clia 176 million passengers in 2013 took cruises on clia member lines versus 72 million passengers in 2000 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 71 based on clia’s research we believe that cruising is underpenetrated and represents approximately 12 of the north american vacation market as measured in berths or room count the cruise industry is relatively nascent compared to the wide variety of much more established vacation travel destinations across north america 

according to the orlandoorange county convention  visitors bureau and the las vegas convention and visitors authority there are approximately 267000 rooms in just orlando and las vegas combined by comparison the estimated major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths is approximately 241000 in addition according to industry research only 24 of the us population has ever taken a cruise and we believe this percentage should increase the european vacation market the fastest growing market globally remains underpenetrated by the cruise industry with approximately 1 of europeans having taken a cruise in a given year compared with 3 of the population in the us and canada the importance of europe and other markets outside of north america are increasing in importance as evidenced by the percentage of passengers sourced by clia member lines outside of north america which has grown from 9 in 2000 to an expected 33 in 2013 we believe that improving leisure travel trends along with a relatively low supply outlook in the near term from the major north american cruise brands lead to an attractive business environment for our company to operate in 

attractive demographic trends to drive cruising growth 

the cruise market is comprised of a broad spectrum of guests and appeals to virtually all demographic categories based on clia’s 2011 cruise market profile study the target north american cruise market defined as households with income of 40000 or more headed by a person who is at least 25 years old is estimated to be 1329 million people also according to the study the average cruise customer has a household income of 109000 it is our belief that “freestyle cruising” will help us attract the younger generations who we believe are more likely to enjoy greater levels of freedom from our “freestyle cruising” product offering than was traditionally offered within the cruise industry 

significant value proposition and high level of guest satisfaction 

we believe that the cost of a cruise vacation relative to a comparable landbased resort or hotel vacation in orlando or las vegas offers an exceptional value proposition when one considers that a typical cruise for an allinclusive price offers its guests transportation to a variety of destinations hotelstyle accommodations a generous diversity of food choices and a selection of daily entertainment options this is compelling support for the cruise value proposition relative to other leisure alternatives cruises have become even more affordable for a greater number of north american guests over the past few years through the introduction of “homeland cruising” which eliminates the cost of airfare commonly associated with a vacation according to clia’s 2011 study approximately 70 of persons who have taken a cruise rate cruising as a highvalue vacation alternative in this same survey clia reported that approximately 80 of cruise passengers agree that a cruise vacation is a good way to sample various destinations that they may visit again on a landbased vacation 

high barriers to entry 

the cruise industry is characterized by high barriers to entry including the existence of several established and recognizable brands the large investment to build a new sophisticated cruise ship the long lead time necessary to construct new ships and limited newbuild shipyard capacity based on new ship orders announced over the past several years the cost to build a cruise ship can range from approximately 500 million to 14 billion or approximately 200000 to 425000 per berth depending on the ship’s size and quality of product offering the construction time of a newbuild ship is typically between 27 months to 36 months and requires significant upfront cash payments to fund construction costs before revenue is generated in addition the shipbuilding industry is experiencing tightened capacity as the size of ships increases and the industry consolidates with virtually all new capacity added in the last 20 years having been built by one of three major european shipbuilders 

  

varied segments and brands 

the different cruise lines that make up the global cruise vacation industry have historically been segmented by product offering and service quality into “contemporary” “premium” and “luxury” brands the contemporary segment generally includes cruises on larger ships that last seven days or less provides a casual ambiance and is less expensive on average than the premium or luxury segments the premium segment is generally characterized by cruises that last from seven to 14 nights with a higher quality product offering than the contemporary segment appealing to a more affluent demographic the luxury segment generally offers the highest level of service and quality with longer cruises on the smallest ships in classifying our competitors within the major north american cruise brands the contemporary segment has historically included carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international the premium segment has historically included celebrity cruises holland america and princess cruises we believe that we straddle the contemporary and premium segments as well as offer a unique combination of value and leisure services to cruise guests our brand offers our guests a rich stateroom mix which includes single studios private balconies and luxury suites with personal butler and concierge service and villas in the haven our “ship within a ship” concept as part of our “freestyle cruising” experience we also offer various specialty dining venues some of which are exclusive to our suite and the haven guests 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy 

leading cruise operator with highquality product offering 

we believe that our modern fleet provides us with operational and strategic advantages as our entire fleet has been purposebuilt for “freestyle cruising” with a wider range of passenger amenities relative to many of our competitors we believe that in recent years the distinction has been blurred between segments of the market historically known as premium and contemporary with the major north american cruise brands each offering a wide range of onboard experiences across their respective fleets as a result of our ongoing fleet renewal initiatives we believe that based on a number of different metrics that directly impact a guest’s onboard experience we compare favorably against the other major north american cruise brands with many product attributes that are more in line with the premium segment 

 

  

  

  

 “freestyle cruising” 

the most important differentiator for our brand is the “freestyle cruising” concept onboard all 13 of our ships the essence of “freestyle cruising” is to provide a cruise experience that offers more freedom and flexibility than any other traditional cruise alternative while many cruise lines have historically required guests to dine at assigned group tables and at specified times “freestyle cruising” offers the flexibility and choice to our guests who prefer to dine when they want with whomever they want and without having to dress formally additionally we have increased the number of activities and dining facilities available onboard allowing guests to tailor their onboard experience to their own schedules desires and tastes 

all of our ships have been custom designed and purposebuilt for “freestyle cruising” which we believe differentiates us significantly from our major competitors we further believe that “freestyle cruising” attracts a passenger base that prefers the less structured resortstyle experience of our cruises we continue to introduce initiatives that enhance the “freestyle cruising” experience most recently with 

  

the fleetwide upgrade of our youth programs and the addition of the popular specialty dining venue moderno churrascaria to many of our ships with norwegian epic norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway we have further enhanced “freestyle cruising” by offering what we believe to be unmatched flexibility in entertainment which includes a wide variety of activities and programming to choose from at any time of day or night 

established brand recognition

maximize net yields 

we are focused on growing our revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing our ticket prices and occupancy as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall net yields to maximize passenger ticket revenue our revenue management strategy is focused on optimizing pricing and generating demand throughout the booking curve we utilize a baseloading strategy to fill our capacity by booking guests as early before sailing as possible baseloading is a strategy that focuses on selling inventory further from the cruise departure date by utilizing certain sales and marketing tactics to generate business with longer booking windows which allows us to fill our ships earlier rather than discounting close to sailing dates in order to achieve our targeted occupancy percentages our specific initiatives to achieve this include 

 

  

  

 we continue to focus on various initiatives to drive increased onboard revenue across a variety of areas from the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2013 our net onboard and other revenue yield increased by 318 from 4058 to 5350 primarily due to strong performance in casino beverage sales shore excursions and specialty dining our strategy for further driving increased onboard revenue includes among other things generating additional casino revenue through our arrangements with our casino partners including caesars entertainment and genting hk these arrangements incorporate marketing 

  

resources to deliver crosscompany advertising and marketing campaigns to promote our brand we also focus on optimizing the utilization of our specialty restaurants and prebooking and preselling additional onboard activities in addition norwegian epic norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway have created additional onboard revenue opportunities based on our premium entertainment offerings

the table below provides a brief description of our ships and areas of operation based on projected 2014 itineraries 

 

  

 itineraries 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from one day to three weeks calling on over 100 worldwide locations including destinations in the caribbean bermuda the bahamas mexico alaska europe hawaii new england central america north africa and scandinavia we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the americas and europe for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 60 of our itineraries by capacity days were in more exotic underpenetrated and less traditional locations areas outside of the caribbean and bahamas which we believe allows us to generate higher net yield 

ports and facilities 

we have an agreement with the government of bermuda whereby two of our ships are permitted weekly calls in bermuda through 2018 from boston baltimore charleston and new york in addition we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on certain itineraries we have a contract with the new york city economic development corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights on specific piers at the city’s passenger ship terminals furthermore we have contracts with the port of new orleans and the port of miami pursuant to which we receive preferential berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals we have an agreement with the houston port authority through april 15 2017 for certain exclusive berthing rights at the houston passenger cruise terminal we have a concession permit with the us national park service whereby our ships are permitted to call on glacier bay during each summer cruise season through september 30 2019 most recently we entered into an agreement with the british virgin islands port authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15year term with two options to extend the agreement for additional five year terms we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary 

  

revenue management practices 

our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities including meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place we generate additional revenue on our ships principally from casino operations beverage sales specialty dining shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo and other similar items 

passenger ticket revenue 

we base our ticket pricing and revenue management on a strategy that encourages travelers to book early and secure attractive savings this is accomplished through a revenue management system designed to maximize net yield by matching projected availability to anticipated future passenger demand we perform extensive analyses of our databases in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in addition we establish a set of stateroom categories throughout each cruise ship and price our cruise fares on the basis of these stateroom categories typically the initial published fares are established at least 18 months in advance of the departure of a cruise at a level which under normal circumstances would provide a high occupancy if the rate at which stateroom inventory is sold differs from expectations we will raise or lower the prices of each stateroom category accordingly this can be done through promotions special rate codes opening and closing categories or price changes our revenue management tool which is typical of what is used in the industry tracks and forecasts overall booking demand and provides optimal pricing and selling limit recommendations on a daily basis the system allows us to better optimize our booking curve and shorten the time to implement pricing decisions and is designed to optimize revenue for the full range of stateroom categories thereby reducing the need for last minute discounting to fill ships 

onboard and other revenue 

ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs we generate additional revenue on our ships principally from casino operations beverage sales specialty dining shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services photo and other similar items onboard and other revenue is an important component of our revenue base representing 294 of our 2013 total revenue to maximize onboard revenue we use various cross marketing and promotional tools and are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these onboard products and services food and beverage gaming and shore excursions are managed directly by the company while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services are managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions 

seasonality 

the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods 

sales and marketing 

product distribution channels and sales 

we sell our product through our primary distribution channels retailtravel agent international and meetings incentives and charters the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales guests utilizing this channel book their cruises through independent travel agents who sell our itineraries on a nonexclusive commissionbased basis given the importance of the retailtravel agent channel a major focus of our marketing strategy is motivating and supporting our travel partners our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe asia and australia 

we introduced our partners first program in 2010 and since then have implemented over 200 initiatives specifically designed to improve our efficiency with travel agent channels and our guests ranging from more timely commission payments to aggressive call center quality monitoring we also restructured our travel agent sales force allowing us to more effectively support the larger accounts with specific expertise and also gain access to a significantly larger number of travel partners through an outbound call center 

outside of the us we have an international sales presence in europe and representatives covering latin america australia and asia we are primarily focused on increasing our business in the united kingdom and continental europe markets which have grown significantly in recent years and where we now offer local itineraries yearround we have modified our itineraries to increase demand by appealing to guests in different markets including the united kingdom italy germany and spain we have had success with our baseloading initiatives in europe where our “freestyle cruising” has been well received and are in the process of building our sales force in europe 

  

finally our meetings incentives and charters channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meeting and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction in addition it strengthens baseloading which allows us to fill our ships earlier rather than discounting close to sailing dates in order to achieve our targeted occupancy percentages 

we have undertaken a major effort to grow demand across all channels with a targeted sales and marketing program for our premium stateroom categories including the haven which has increased significantly as a percentage of our total inventory as a result of our fleet renewal and newbuild program 

supporting our sales efforts across several distribution channels are our call centers located in florida arizona the united kingdom and germany with approximately 700 personnel oriented towards servicing travel agents we believe that our diverse locations should minimize risks associated with natural disasters labor markets and other factors which could impact the operation of our call centers 

marketing brand communications and advertising 

our marketing department works to enhance our brand awareness and increase levels of engagement and understanding of our product and services among consumers trade and travel partners core areas within the department include brand strategy advertising and media marketing communications direct marketing customer loyalty websiteinteractive and market research all marketing supports our comprehensive brand platform created expressly to leverage our unique “freestyle cruising” concept with this emphasis we launched a new brand platform in october 2011 “cruise like a norwegian” which is intended to develop community around norwegian cruise line and communicates our commitment to providing an exceptional vacation experience centered around freedom and flexibility the media mix has included television print radio digital email direct mail and billboards in addition to our ncl university online which is an informative travel partner education program we introduced a new component to our travel partner marketing “partners first” as a result a survey with travel agents indicates we have improved in ease of doing business 

we have made significant progress in expanding our marketing reach with our online products and services our website wwwnclcom serving both our travel agency partners and guests has been a major focus of this momentum we are continually enhancing our website to ensure that it communicates our brand promise promotes relevant product information and aligns with our “cruise like a norwegian” and “freestyle cruising” messages our consumer and travel agency partner booking engine provides travel agency partners and guests the ability to shop and purchase any of our worldwide cruise itineraries with a more intuitive and informative online experience we continue to develop additional functionality and tools to serve our travel agency partners and guests 

sustainable customer loyalty of our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to our past guests’ needs and motivations creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brand products and services and often return to our ships the norwegian cruise line loyalty program has been improved and is now known as latitudes rewards improvements to the loyalty program include incentives and rewards allowing guests to earn points based on the number of cruise nights level of accommodations and certain booking windows members of this program receive periodic mailings with informative destination information and cruise promotions that include special pricing shipboard credits and onboard recognition also avid cruisers can use our cobranded credit card to earn upgrades and discounts 

customer feedback and research is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies we regularly initiate custom research studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit feedback that helps shape future direction 

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

ship maintenance 

in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock duration is a statutory requirement controlled under chapters of the international convention of the safety of life at seas “solas” and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock twice in 5 years and the maximum duration between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas flag state after meeting certain criteria set forth by the bahamas to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair 

  

and maintenance work we do not earn revenue while ships are drydocked accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability 

suppliers 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for payroll fuel food and beverage travel agent services and advertising and marketing most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry 

crew and passenger safety 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of solas and the international safety management code maritime standards the international safety requirements which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in weekly safety drills onboard every one of our ships 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous simulation training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on a twoperson team approach accordingly there are always two officers in charge of bridge operations mandating strict adherence to operating procedures furthermore our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary 

prior to every cruise setting sail we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits we have installed hifog sprinklers in the engine rooms of the ships in our fleet as required by the imo regulation the navigation centers on our ships are also equipped with voyage data recorders “vdrs” which are similar in concept to the black boxes used in commercial aircraft the vdrs permit us to analyze safety incidents our ships utilize operational closed circuit television systems that enhance our training assist in investigations and support the safety of guests and crew 

we have developed the sems and this advanced intranetbased system establishes the policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside it also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through this system our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet the sems is approved and audited annually by our classification society det norske veritas dnv and the system also undergoes regular internal audits as well as an annual audit by the us coast guard we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments we believe that we are in compliance with current health and safety rules and regulations 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 1900 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 15000 shipboard employees also we refer you to “risk factors—risk factors related to our business—amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets 

  

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships discussed above we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business we carry 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which is scheduled to take effect on april 23 2014 establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer 

on december 31 2012 the eu passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the “freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” other significant marks include our school of fish design marks that display one fish swimming against a school of fish we believe our “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” the names of our ships as well as the school of fish design and cruise like a norwegian logos are widely recognized throughout north america and europe and have considerable value 

competition 

we compete in the multinight global cruise vacation industry although this sector has grown significantly over the past decade it still remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by landbased vacation alternatives the different cruise brands that make up the global cruise vacation industry historically have been segmented by product offering and service quality into contemporary premium and luxury cruises the contemporary segment generally includes cruises on larger ships that last seven days or less provides a casual ambiance and is less expensive than the premium or luxury segments the premium segment generally is characterized by cruises that last from seven to 14 nights with a higher quality product offering than the contemporary segment appealing to a more affluent demographic the luxury segment generally offers the highest level of services and quality with longer cruises on the smallest ships 

we compete primarily with the other major north american cruise brands which together comprise approximately 90 of the north american cruise market as measured by total berths these brands include carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international which comprise the contemporary segment and holland america princess cruises and celebrity cruises which are part of the premium segment as of december 31 2013 norwegian cruise line accounted for approximately 13 of the major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths we compete against all of these operators principally on the quality of our ships our differentiated product offering selection of our itineraries and value proposition of our cruises we also face competition from noncruise vacation alternatives including beach resorts golf and tennis resorts theme parks landbased gaming operations and other hotels and tourist destinations

also in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements including ratings by inspectors from the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the fda we believe we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene to assist cruise lines in achieving the highest health and sanitation standards on cruise ships 

in 2012 we received our international organization for standardization’s “iso” 90012008 certification which is the primary globally accepted standard for quality assurance and quality performance this is a milestone which sets the stage for quality operations and guest satisfaction furthermore norwegian is certified under the iso 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management plan that is incorporated into the sems program 

pursuant to us federal maritime commission “fmc” and us coast guard regulations we have covered our financial responsibility with respect to death or injury to passengers and water pollution by providing required guarantees from our insurers with respect to such potential liabilities this includes obtaining certificates of financial responsibility required by the us coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liabilities in cases of water pollution 

permits for glacier bay alaska 

in connection with certain of our alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future 

  

security and safety 

pursuant to provisions adopted by the imo all cruise ships were required to be certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” we have obtained certificates certifying that our ships are in compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification 

we believe that our ships currently comply with all requirements of the imo and the us and bahamian flags including but not limited to solas marpol and the standard of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers “stcw” the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 and provides for measures strengthening maritime security and places new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports we comply with the isps code 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships we believe our fleet is in compliance with the requirements imposed upon it by the mtsa and the us coast guard regulations the transportation workers identification credential is a federal requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships we are in compliance with this requirement 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems by december 31 2005 failure to comply with the solas requirements with respect to any ship will among other things restrict the operations of such ship in the us and many other jurisdictions we are in compliance with these requirements 

imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction existing ships are required to comply with this solas amendment by the first statutory survey after july 1 2008 all of our ships are in compliance with the solas amendment 

the solas regulation on longrange identification and tracking entered into force on january 1 2008 ships constructed on or after december 31 2008 must be fitted with a system that automatically transmits the identity of the ship the position of the ship latitude and longitude and the date and time of the position we are in compliance with these requirements 

imo’s maritime safety committee requires carriage of a bridge navigational watch alarm system “bnwas” complying with imo performance standards for existing ships over 3000 gross tons the equipment should be installed in connection with the first survey after july 1 2012 new ships over 150 gross tons and all new passenger ships constructed after july 1 2011 shall be equipped with a bnwas all of our ships are in compliance with these requirements 

financial requirements 

the fmc requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly we are required to maintain a 150 million thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers recent regulations have revised the financial requirements with respect to both deathinjury and nonperformance coverages to increase the 150 million performance guarantee to 220 million effective april 2 2014 and to 300 million effective april 2 2015 also we have a legal requirement for us to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the united kingdom and have a bond with the association of british travel agents currently valued at british pound sterling 57 million we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions 

from time to time various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the us and the cruise industry in general 

  

taxation 

taxation of operating income in general 

this discussion is based on the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” existing final and temporary regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions all as in effect on the date of this filing and all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below the following discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the us federal income tax considerations applicable to us unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses collectively referred to as “shipping income” to the extent that the shipping income is derived from sources within the us 

for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as ussource international shipping income will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a us port but that calls on one or more foreign ports will derive ussource income only from the first and last legs of such cruise however since there are no us treasury regulations or other us internal revenue service “irs” guidance with respect to these rules the applicability of the transportation income source rules described above is not free from doubt 

no portion of shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between nonus ports will be considered to be derived from sources within the us such shipping income will not be subject to any us federal income tax shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between us ports will be considered to be 100 derived from us sources 

unless exempt from tax under section 883 of the code i any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business “effectively connected income” as discussed below under “—taxation in absence of section 883 exemption” would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate and state and local taxes and nclh’s effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 the “net tax regime” and ii if not considered to be effectively connected income any ussource income would be subject to a 4 tax on gross income provided under section 887 of the code the “4 regime” 

the ussource portion of our income that is not shipping income is generally subject to the net tax regime us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and preand postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income 

to the extent funds are legally available the tax agreement governing the ncl corporation units provides that nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holder the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh generally these tax distributions will be computed based on an estimate of the taxable income determined for us federal income tax purposes allocable to the ncl corporation unit holder multiplied by the us federal and state income tax rate applicable to each holder as determined in the sole discretion of nclh 

exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation 

under section 883 of the code and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource international shipping income if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 of the code and to which we refer as the “country of organization test” and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by “qualified shareholders” which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country to which we refer as the “50 ownership test” 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us and certain exceptions do not apply to which we refer as the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” and it satisfies an ownership test to which collectively we refer as the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements 

  

bermuda the jurisdiction where we are incorporated has been officially recognized by the irs as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax in respect of each category of shipping income we expect to earn in the future therefore nclh will satisfy the country of organization test and will likely be exempt from us federal income taxation with respect to our ussource international shipping income if nclh is able to satisfy any one of the 50 ownership test the publicly traded test or the cfc test as discussed further below as of the date of this annual report we expect to satisfy the publicly traded test 

the regulations under section 883 of the code provide in pertinent part that a corporation will meet the publicly traded test if one or more classes of stock of a foreign corporation representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us a class of stock will be considered to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of such class of stock that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares of such stock that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country 

under the regulations a class of stock will be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market if a such class of stock is listed on such market b such class of stock is traded on such market other than in minimal quantities on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one sixth of the days in a short taxable year and c the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10 of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year 

the regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if a class of stock is traded on an established securities market in the us and is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such stock the regulations provide in pertinent part that a class of stock will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50 or more of the outstanding shares of such class of stock are owned on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5 or more of the outstanding shares of such class of stock to which we refer as the “five percent override rule” the “five percent override rule” will not apply if nclh can substantiate that the number of nclh’s ordinary shares owned for more than half of the number of days in the taxable year 1 directly or indirectly applying attribution rules by its qualified shareholders and 2 by its non5 shareholders is greater than 50 of its outstanding ordinary shares 

as of the date of this filing we expect that we will be eligible to claim the section 883 tax exemption on the basis of the publicly traded test since nclh’s ordinary shares are traded on the nasdaq global select market which is considered to be an established securities market nclh expects that its ordinary shares will be deemed to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market furthermore we believe nclh will meet the trading volume requirements described previously because the pertinent regulations provide that trading volume requirements will be deemed to be met with respect to a class of equity traded on an established securities market in the us where the class of equity is regularly quoted by dealers who regularly and actively make offers purchases and sales of such equity to unrelated persons in the ordinary course of business 

as of the date of this filing nclh’s direct non5 shareholders own more than 50 of its ordinary shares based on the foregoing as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh’s ordinary shares will be considered to be “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” and that nclh and each of its corporate subsidiaries in which nclh owns more than 50 of the value of the outstanding stock and that is organized in a qualifying foreign country will therefore qualify for the section 883 tax exemption however there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares or the status of certain of its qualified shareholders which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption therefore we can give no assurance in this regard should any of the facts described above cease to be correct or the direct or indirect ownership of nclh’s ordinary shares change nclh and its subsidiaries’ ability to qualify for the section 883 tax exemption will be compromised also it should be noted that section 883 of the code has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 of the code 

in addition because nclh is relying on the substantial ownership by non5 shareholders in order to satisfy the regularly traded test there is the potential that if another shareholder becomes a 5 shareholder our qualification under the publicly traded test could be jeopardized if nclh were to fail to satisfy the publicly traded test we could be subject to us income tax on income associated with our cruise operations in the us therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of the five percent override rule applying in this regard nclh’s byelaws provide that no one person or group of related persons other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk may own or be deemed to own by virtue of the 

  

attribution provisions of the code more than 49 of its ordinary shares whether measured by vote value or number unless such ownership is approved by its board of directors in addition any person or group of related persons that own 3 or more or a lower percentage if required by the us treasury regulations under the code of nclh’s ordinary shares will be required to meet certain notice requirements as provided for in its byelaws nclh’s byelaws generally restrict the transfer of any of its ordinary shares if such transfer would cause nclh to be subject to us shipping income tax in general detailed attribution rules that treat a shareholder as owning shares that are owned by certain other persons are applied in determining whether a person is a 5 shareholder 

for purposes of the 49 limit a “transfer” includes any sale transfer gift assignment devise or other disposition whether voluntary or involuntary whether of record constructively or beneficially and whether by operation of law or otherwise the 49 limit does not apply to the apollo funds the tpg viking funds or genting hk these shareholders are permitted to transfer their shares without complying with the limit subject to certain restrictions 

nclh’s byelaws provide that its board of directors may waive the 49 limit or transfer restrictions in any specific instance the board of directors may also terminate the limit and transfer restrictions generally at any time for any reason if a purported transfer or other event results in the ownership of ordinary shares by any shareholder in violation of the 49 limit or causes nclh to be subject to us income tax on shipping operations such ordinary shares in excess of the 49 limit or which would cause nclh to be subject to us shipping income tax will automatically be designated as “excess shares” to the extent necessary to ensure that the purported transfer or other event does not result in ownership of ordinary shares in violation of the 49 limit or cause nclh to become subject to us income tax on shipping operations and any proposed transfer that would result in such an event would be void any purported transferee or other purported holder of excess shares will be required to give nclh written notice of a purported transfer or other event that would result in excess shares the purported transferee or holders of such excess shares shall have no rights in such excess shares other than a right to the payments described below excess shares will not be treasury shares but rather will continue to be issued and outstanding ordinary shares while outstanding excess shares will be transferred to a trust the trustee of such trust will be appointed by nclh and will be independent of nclh and the purported holder of the excess shares the beneficiary of such trust will be one or more charitable organizations that is a qualified shareholder selected by the trustee the trustee will be entitled to vote the excess shares on behalf of the beneficiary if after a purported transfer or other event resulting in excess shares and prior to the discovery by us of such transfer or other event dividends or distributions are paid with respect to such excess shares such dividends or distributions will be immediately due and payable to the trustee for payment to the charitable beneficiary all dividends received or other income declared by the trust will be paid to the charitable beneficiary upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of nclh the purported transferee or other purported holder will receive a payment that reflects a price per share for such excess shares generally equal to the lesser of 

 

  

 at the direction of nclh’s board of directors the trustee will transfer the excess shares held in trust to a person or persons including nclh whose ownership of such excess shares will not violate the 49 limit or otherwise cause nclh to become subject to us shipping income tax within 180 days after the later of the transfer or other event that resulted in such excess shares or we become aware of such transfer or event if such a transfer is made the interest of the charitable beneficiary will terminate the designation of such shares as excess shares will cease and the purported holder of the excess shares will receive the payment described below the purported transferee or holder of the excess shares will receive a payment that reflects a price per share for such excess shares equal to the lesser of 

 

  

 a purported transferee or holder of the excess shares will not be permitted to receive an amount that reflects any appreciation in the excess shares during the period that such excess shares were outstanding any amount received in excess of the amount permitted to be received by the purported transferee or holder of the excess shares must be turned over to the charitable beneficiary of the trust if the foregoing restrictions are determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision statute rule or regulation then the intended transferee or holder of any excess shares may be deemed at nclh’s option to have acted as an agent on its behalf in acquiring or holding such excess shares and to hold such excess shares on nclh’s behalf 

  

nclh has the right to purchase any excess shares held by the trust for a period of 90 days from the later of 

 

  

 the price per excess share to be paid by nclh will be equal to the lesser of 

 

  

 these provisions in nclh’s byelaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in our control or other transaction in which nclh’s shareholders might receive a premium for their ordinary shares over the thenprevailing market price or which such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest the board of directors may determine in its sole discretion to terminate the 49 limit and the transfer restrictions of these provisions while both the mandatory offer protection and 49 protection remain in place no third party other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds or genting hk will be able to acquire control of nclh 

taxation in absence of section 883 exemption 

if nclh does not qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code as described above i any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is effectively connected income as described below would be subject to the net tax regime and ii if not considered to be effectively connected income any ussource income would be subject to the 4 regime nclh’s ussource international shipping income would be considered effectively connected income only if it has or is considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of ussource international shipping income and substantially all of its ussource international shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us this would likely be the case 

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

provided we and our subsidiaries qualify for exemption from tax under section 883 of the code in respect of our shipping income gain from the sale of a vessel likewise should generally be exempt from tax under section 883 of the code if however nclh’s gain does not for whatever reason qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or 4 regime determined under rules different from those discussed above 

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial 

changes in tax laws 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 of the code and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the united states moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law 

us federal income taxation—usflagged operation 

income derived from our usflagged operation generally will be subject to us federal and state income taxation at combined graduated rates of approximately 39 after an allowance for deductions in connection with implementation of a global tax platform during 2013 we expect current and future income derived in respect of this operation to be exempt from branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty and expect to incur a us tax liability of approximately 226 million after considering net operating losses “nols” obtained from our shareholders discussed below in us federal income taxation—net operating losses  

  

us federal income taxation—net operating losses 

as a result of the corporate reorganization described above under “item 1 business—history and development of the company” we obtained certain nols of our corporate shareholders section 382 of the code places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by nol carryforwards after a change in control generally greater than 50 change in ownership of a loss corporation generally after a change in control a loss corporation cannot deduct nol carryforwards in excess of the section 382 limitation due to these change in ownership provisions utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation we anticipate that use of our nol carryforwards will not be significantly limited as a result of section 382 of the code and expect some or all of these loss carryforwards to be utilized during 2013

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in connection with the forwardlooking statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” 

risk factors related to our business 

the specific risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this annual report could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results and individually or any combination thereof could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the adverse impact of general economic and related factors such as high levels of unemployment and underemployment fuel price increases declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate such as higher fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests 

an increase in cruise capacity without a corresponding increase in passenger demand could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

historically cruise capacity has grown to meet the growth in demand according to clia 176 million passengers in 2013 took cruises on clia member lines versus 72 million passengers in 2000 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 71 clia estimates that between 2013 and 2016 the north america based clia member line fleet will increase by approximately 29 ships representing a compound annual capacity growth of 34 in order to profitably utilize this new capacity the cruise industry 

  

will likely need to improve its percentage share of the us population who has cruised at least once which is approximately 24 according to clia if there is an industrywide increase in capacity without a corresponding increase in public demand we as well as the entire cruise industry could experience reduced occupancy rates andor be forced to discount our prices in addition increased cruise capacity could impact our ability to retain and attract qualified shipboard employees including officers at competitive levels and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

we face intense competition from other cruise companies as well as noncruise vacation alternatives and we may not be able to compete effectively 

we face intense competition from other cruise companies primarily the other major north american cruise brands which together comprise approximately 90 of the north american cruise market as measured by total berths these brands include carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international in the contemporary segment and holland america princess cruises and celebrity cruises in the premium segment as of december 31 2013 norwegian cruise line accounted for approximately 13 of the major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths we compete against all of these operators principally on the quality of our ships our differentiated product offering selection of our itineraries and value proposition of our cruises we also face competition for many itineraries from other cruise operators as well as competition from noncruise vacation alternatives in the event we do not compete effectively our business could be adversely affected 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments 

our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition operations prospects and flexibility as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 31 billion of total debt our substantial indebtedness could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 based on our december 31 2013 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in the libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 194 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest in addition future financings we may undertake may also provide for rates that fluctuate with prevailing interest rates 

negative publicity surrounding the cruise industry may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

negative publicity or heightened media scrutiny of the cruise industry due to incidents relating to vessel operation environmental or natural disasters such as hurricanes epidemics and viral outbreaks aboard a vessel or any occurrence which brings into question the safety and security of the industry may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including the decrease in demand for cruise vacations and a damage to the reputation of the cruise industry as a safe and reliable vacation alternative the considerable expansion in the use of social media in recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated 

  

increases in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations 

fuel expense accounted for 183 of our total cruise operating expense in 2013 192 in 2012 and 166 in 2011 future increases in the cost of fuel globally would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control 

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increase in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies because some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies we are exposed to exchange rate risks additional risks include interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours would likely contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs 

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under the agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder 

 

  

  

 such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our indebtedness under our existing senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 

  

if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

despite our substantial indebtedness we may still be able to incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may be able to incur substantial indebtedness at any time in the future although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

 

  

 there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under certain of our existing senior secured credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due neither our sponsors nor any of their respective affiliates has any continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all some of the counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees may be unable to perform their obligations or may breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument 

terrorist acts acts of piracy armed conflict and threats thereof and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

past acts of terrorism have had an adverse effect on tourism travel and the availability of air service and other forms of transportation the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility thereof the issuance of travel advisories by national governments and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability 

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

in 2013 the majority of our guests booked their cruises through independent travel agents in the event that the travel agent distribution channel is adversely impacted by the worldwide economic downturn or other reason this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels 

  

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger connections and increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base 

a number of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices or other factors would increase the overall vacation cost to our guests and may adversely affect demand for our cruises changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests to our cruises andor increase our cruise operating expense 

any delays in the construction and delivery of a cruise ship could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

delays in the construction repair refurbishment and delivery of a cruise ship can occur as a result of events such as insolvency work stoppages other labor actions or “force majeure” events experienced by our shipbuilders and other such companies that are beyond our control any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship particularly in light of decreasing availability of drydock facilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

epidemics and viral outbreaks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of h1n1 stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises if any wideranging health scare should occur our business financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 

the political environment in certain countries where we operate is uncertain and our ability to operate our business as we have in the past may be restricted 

we operate in waters and call at ports throughout the world including geographic regions that from time to time have experienced political and civil unrest as well as insurrection and armed hostilities adverse international events could affect demand for cruise products generally and could have an adverse effect on us 

adverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions maritime disaster including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes which may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased port related and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that all risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us which could reduce our cash flows if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage or coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations we have made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our website and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation if our security measures were breached we could be exposed to cyberrelated risks and malware and access to credit cards and other sensitive data could be at risk 

  

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results 

currently we are a party to six collective bargaining agreements three of these agreements are in effect through 2014 of the three remaining agreements two are scheduled to expire in 2018 and one is scheduled to expire in 2020 upon appropriate notice the agreements may be reopened at certain yearly intervals and we received notice from one of the parties to reopen wagebenefit negotiations in 2013 these negotiations were completed and effective from july 2013 without material cost to the company any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition our collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

unavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon the ability expertise judgment discretion integrity and good faith of our senior management team our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth the loss of services of any of the key members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 1— “business—executive officers” for additional information about our management personnel 

the leadership of our president and chief executive officer mr sheehan and other executive officers has been a critical element of our success the death or disability of mr sheehan or other extended or permanent loss of his services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss could have a material adverse effect on our business our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also materially adversely affect us we are not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us 

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes could increase the amount of taxes we must pay 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—regulatory issues—taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” the provisions of section 883 of the code are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect 

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests under section 883 of the code as described in “item 1—business— regulatory issues— taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation of operating income in general” and we can give no assurances on this matter 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 of the code our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— regulatory issues— taxation—taxation of operating income in general” as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the stock ownership tests imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the 

  

exemption under section 883 however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues—taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect for example legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from us federal income tax under section 883 of the code and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the united states moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the us – uk income tax treaty on income derived in respect of our us–flagged operation 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual states are considering as well as implementing new laws and rules to manage cruise ship waste in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as solas an international safety regulation marpol an international environmental regulation and stcw and its conventions in ship manning international regulations regarding ballast water and security levels are currently pending 

additionally the us and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies such as requiring the use of lowsulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements and further restricting emissions including those of greenhouse gases compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations in 2006 alaskan voters approved a ballot measure requiring that cruise ships meet alaska water quality standards “wqs” pursuant to the ballot measure alaska approved stringent regulations and required a waste water discharge permit for cruise ships beginning in 2008 legislation approved in 2009 allowed the state to issue general permits that contain effluent limits or standards that are less stringent than the wqs where the ship is using economically feasible methods of pollution prevention in 2013 the state extended the permit program and allowed ship operators to apply for mixing zones in upcoming permits an option that may ease compliance with certain wqs the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 went into force on august 20 2013 the convention regulates many aspects of maritime crew labor and impacts the worldwide sourcing of new crewmembers marpol regulations have established special emission control areas “ecas” with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions ships operating in designated ecas which include the baltic sea the north seaenglish channel and many of the waters within 200 nautical miles of the us and canadian coasts including the hawaiian islands waters surrounding puerto rico and the us virgin islands have been included as of january 2014 are generally expected to meet the new emissions limits through the use of lowsulfur fuels 

these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

by virtue of our operations in the us the fmc requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues” 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes some of which were rolled back in 2010 which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises 

  

changes in health safety security and other regulatory issues could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to various international national state and local health safety and security laws and regulations for additional discussion of these requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues” changes in existing legislation or regulations and the imposition of new requirements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

implementation of us federal regulations requiring us citizens to obtain passports for seaborne travel to all foreign destinations could adversely affect our business many cruise guests may not currently have passports or may not obtain a passport card previously known as the people access security service card or pass card as an alternative to a passport this card was created to meet the documentary requirements of the western hemisphere travel initiative applications for the card have been accepted since february 1 2008 and the cards were made available to the public beginning in july 2008 

we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march 31 2035 which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

under current bermuda law we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains we have received from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act 1966 as amended an assurance that in the event that bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits income any capital asset gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares debentures or other obligations until march 31 2035 we could be subject to taxes in bermuda after that date this assurance is subject to the proviso that it is not to be construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in bermuda or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to us we pay annual bermuda government fees 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of nasdaq and as a result rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 

on january 18 2013 nclh listed its ordinary shares on the nasdaq global select market and genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds or their respective affiliates together continue to control a majority of its ordinary shares as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of nasdaq under the rules of nasdaq a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirement 

 

  

  

  

 nclh has utilized these exemptions as a result nclh does not have a majority of independent directors nor is nclh required to have any independent directors on its nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees and nclh is not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees accordingly its shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to a national securities exchange’s general corporate governance requirements without giving effect to the “controlled company” exemptions of nasdaq 

we are controlled by the sponsors who hold a significant percentage of nclh’s ordinary shares and whose interests may not be aligned with ours or our public shareholders 

the majority of nclh’s voting ordinary shares are held by affiliates of genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds the shareholders’ agreement governing the relationship among those parties gives the apollo funds effective control over our affairs and policies subject to certain limitations genting hk and the apollo funds also control the election of our board of directors the appointment of management the entering into of mergers sales of substantially all of our assets and other material transactions the directors appointed by genting hk and the apollo funds have the authority on our behalf and subject to the terms of our debt agreements and the shareholders’ agreement to issue additional ordinary shares implement share repurchase programs declare dividends pay advisory fees and make other decisions and they may have an interest in our doing so the interests of genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds could conflict with our public shareholders’ interests in material respects 

  

furthermore genting hk engages in the cruise industry and leisure entertainment and hospitality activities and apollo and tpg are in the business of managing investment funds which make investments in companies and one or more of which has now and may from time to time hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us as well as businesses that represent major guests of our business investment funds managed by genting hk apollo andor tpg may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as nclh’s sponsors continue to control a significant amount of its outstanding voting ordinary shares such shareholders will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions additionally the concentration of ownership held by nclh’s sponsors could delay defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger takeover or other business combination 

shareholders of our company may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as shareholders of a us corporation 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to our company differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of our byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of our company than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or our byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers 

the market price for our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations 

the market price for our ordinary shares could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares 

the substantial number of ordinary shares that will be eligible for sale in the near future may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 

there were 205160340 ordinary shares of nclh issued and outstanding as of december 31 2013 the ordinary shares i issued in connection with our ipo ii sold in secondary offerings completed in august and december 2013 by the sponsors iii issued or to be issued under our new longterm incentive plan or iv issued or to be issued in exchange for management ncl corporation units are or will be freely transferable except for any shares held by our “affiliates” as that term is defined in rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” ordinary shares that continue to be held by our sponsors and key employees may also be sold in the public market in the future subject to the restrictions contained in rule 144 under the securities act if our sponsors sell 

  

a substantial amount of our ordinary shares the prevailing market price for our ordinary shares could be adversely affected if our sponsors continue to sell it is possible that one or more sponsors may no longer own any of our ordinary shares the uncertainty regarding the future ownership of the company by the sponsors could materially adversely impact our operations and the market price of our ordinary shares 

as of december 31 2013 there were an aggregate of 4709692 outstanding management ncl corporation units which represent a 22 economic interest in nclc in connection with the consummation of the ipo we entered into an exchange agreement with nclc pursuant to the exchange agreement and subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units has the right to cause nclc and us to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for our ordinary shares at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events we have reserved for issuance a number of our ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units on august 19 2013 nclh filed a registration statement with the sec which is effective to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elected or will elect to exchange we may issue our ordinary shares or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments if any such acquisition or investment is significant the number of ordinary shares or the number or aggregate principal amount as the case may be of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial we may also grant registration rights covering those ordinary shares or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 

we have granted approximately 50 million options to acquire our ordinary shares to our management team under our new longterm incentive plan we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act covering the 15035106 ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our new longterm incentive plan including the shares subject to the option grants described above accordingly ordinary shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market upon exercise or other acquisition by the holders subject to vesting restrictions rule 144 limitations applicable to our affiliates and any applicable contractual lockup provisions 

we do not have current plans to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends to our shareholders and our board of directors may never declare a dividend our debt agreements limit or prohibit and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition we are a holding company and would depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase our ordinary shares 

provisions in our constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

our byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent our shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include subject to the shareholders’ agreement 

 

  

  

  

  

 additionally our byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions as well as the significant ownership of ordinary shares by our sponsors may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares 

  

any issuance of preference shares could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our ordinary shares which could depress the price of our ordinary shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue preference shares and to determine the preferences limitations and relative rights of shares of preference shares and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series without any further vote or action by our shareholders subject to the shareholders’ agreement our preference shares could be issued with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our ordinary shares the potential issuance of preference shares may delay or prevent a change in control of us discouraging bids for our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares

in july 2009 a class action complaint was filed against ncl bahamas ltd in the united states district court southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of crew members alleging inappropriate deductions of their wages pursuant to the seaman’s wage act and wrongful termination resulting in a loss of retirement benefits in december 2010 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in february 2011 the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration as to the court’s order on class certification which was denied the court tried six individual plaintiffs’ claims and in september 2012 awarded wages aggregating approximately 100000 to such plaintiffs in october 2013 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed the court’s rulings as to the denial of class certification and the trial verdict the plaintiffs’ have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the appellate court’s decision we intend to continue to vigorously defend this action and are not able at this time to estimate the impact of these proceedings 

in may 2011 a class action complaint was filed against ncl bahamas ltd in the united states district court southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of crew members alleging inappropriate deductions of their wages pursuant to the seaman’s wage act and breach of contract in july 2012 this action was stayed by the court pending the outcome of the litigation commenced with the class action complaint filed in july 2009 we are vigorously defending this action and are not able at this time to estimate the impact of these proceedings 

in the normal course of our business various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue net yield net cruise cost adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel and adjusted ebitda to enable us to analyze our performance see “terms used in this annual report” for the definition of these nongaap financial measures we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance 

as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of north america a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly euro and british pound sterling which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance is a factor in the evaluation of the performance of management and is the primary metric used in determining the company’s performance incentive bonus paid to its employees we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining the company’s performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of the company’s business such as sales growth operating costs 

  

marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or measures comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments 

in addition adjusted net income and adjusted eps are supplemental financial measures used to demonstrate gaap net income and eps excluding certain charges we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance and we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance these charges vary from period to period accordingly our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results 

you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our nongaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our nongaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating our nongaap financial measures you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation our nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of our nongaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section 

financial presentation 

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the summer months 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales shore excursions specialty dining retail sales spa services and photo we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue our cruise operating expense is classified as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies 

  

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 would have increased by 61 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 306 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage 

asset impairment 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates judgments and projections considered necessary the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets principally trade names are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered 

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge as of december 31 2013 our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets 

contingencies 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures 

executive overview 

total revenue increased 129 to 26 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 23 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 net revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 134 to 19 billion from 17 billion in the same period in 2012 with an improvement of both net yield of 43 and capacity days of 88

 year ended december 31 2013 “2013” compared to year ended december 31 2012 “2012” 

revenue 

total revenue increased 129 to 26 billion in 2013 compared to 23 billion in 2012 net revenue increased 134 in 2013 primarily due to an increase in capacity days of 88 related to the delivery of norwegian breakaway and an increase in net yield of 43 the increase in net yield was due to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and higher onboard and other revenue partially due to the introduction of norwegian breakaway to the fleet on a constant currency basis net yield increased 42 in 2013 compared to 2012 

expense 

total cruise operating expense increased 121 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in capacity days expenses related to planned drydocks and fuel expense partially offset by the timing of certain expenses the increase in fuel expense was primarily the result of a 17 increase in the average fuel price to 675 per metric ton in 2013 from 664 in 2012 total other operating expense increased 173 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to noncash expenses related to sharebased compensation recognized upon the realization of our ipo the timing of certain expenses and depreciation expense related to the addition of norwegian breakaway on a capacity day basis net cruise cost increased 50 on an as reported and 48 on a constant currency basis due to the expenses discussed above adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 36 and 34 on an as reported and constant currency basis respectively mainly due to the timing of certain expenses 

  

interest expense net increased to 2826 million in 2013 from 1899 million in 2012 primarily due to 1606 million of expenses associated with debt prepayments partially offset by lower interest rates resulting from the benefits from the redemption of higher rate debt and refinancing transactions 

income tax expense increased to 118 million in 2013 from 07 million in 2012 primarily due to the change in our us tax status from a partnership to a corporation in connection with our ipo 

year ended december 31 2012 “2012” compared to year ended december 31 2011 “2011” 

revenue 

total revenue increased 26 to 23 billion in 2012 compared to 22 billion in 2011 net revenue increased 32 in 2012 primarily due to an increase in net yield of 16 and an increase in capacity days of 16 the increase in net yield was primarily due to an increase in passenger ticket pricing and the increase in capacity days in 2012 was primarily due to the timing of certain repairs and maintenance on a constant currency basis net yield increased 24 in 2012 compared to 2011 

expense 

total cruise operating expense increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an increase in capacity days as described above and higher ship operating expenses the increase in ship operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in fuel expense as a result of a 163 increase in average fuel price to 664 per metric ton in 2012 from 571 in 2011 total other operating expense increased slightly compared to 2011 due to an increase in depreciation expense related to the purchase of norwegian sky primarily offset by lower general and administrative expenses as a result of ongoing business improvement initiatives net cruise cost increased slightly in 2012 primarily due to an increase in capacity days on a capacity day basis net cruise cost decreased 10 primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses discussed above substantially offset by an increase in fuel expense excluding fuel expense net cruise cost per capacity day decreased 53 on a constant currency basis net cruise cost per capacity day decreased slightly and excluding fuel expense decreased 46 

interest expense net of capitalized interest was 1899 million in 2012 compared to 1902 million in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

as of december 31 2013 our liquidity was 4505 million consisting of 565 million in cash and cash equivalents and 3940 million available under our revolving credit facility our primary ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service 

as of december 31 2013 we had a working capital deficit of 8926 million this deficit included 4118 million of advance ticket sales which represents the passenger revenues we collect in advance of sailing dates and accordingly are substantially more like deferred revenue balances rather than actual current cash liabilities our business model along with our revolving credit facility allows us to operate with a working capital deficit and still meet our operating investing and financing needs 

our debt agreements limit or prohibit and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh however we do not believe that these restrictions have had or are expected to have an impact on our ability to meet any cash obligations 

sources and uses of cash 

in this section references to 2013 refer to the year ended december 31 2013 references to 2012 refer to the year ended december 31 2012 and references to 2011 refer to the year ended december 31 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4753 million in 2013 as compared to 3986 million in 2012 and 3570 million in 2011 although net income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to 1242 million of fees related to the prepayment of debt and 114 million of deferred income taxes net cash provided by operating activities increased mainly due to timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities primarily with an increase in advance ticket sales the 2012 balance included 60 million related to the premium received from the issuance of 1000 million of senior unsecured notes the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2012 reflects the increase in net income to 1686 million in 2012 compared to 1269 million in 2011 as well as timing differences in cash receipts and payments relating to operating assets and liabilities and 60 million related to the premium received from the issuance of 1000 million of senior unsecured notes 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 8949 million in 2013 primarily related to the payments for construction and delivery of norwegian breakaway and construction of norwegian getaway as well as other ship improvements and shoreside projects net cash used in investing activities was 3038 million in 2012 primarily related to payments for construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway the purchase of norwegian sky and other ship improvements and shoreside projects net cash used in investing activities was 1848 million in 2011 primarily related to payments for construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway 

net cash provided by financing activities was 4305 million in 2013 primarily due to the issuance of our 3000 million 5 senior notes due 2018 as well as borrowings under other credit facilities and the proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares partially offset by repayments of our 4500 million 1175 senior secured notes due 2016 and revolving credit facilities and a payment related to the norwegian sky purchase agreement net cash used in financing activities was 1082 million in 2012 primarily due to repayments of our revolving credit facilities other borrowings and loan arrangement fees which were partially offset by borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and by the issuance of 1000 million of senior unsecured notes net cash used in financing activities was 1683 million in 2011 primarily due to repayments of our revolving credit facility and repayments of borrowings related to norwegian epic partially offset by borrowings related to the construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway 

future capital commitments 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including future expected capital expenditures for business enhancements and ship construction contracts as of december 31 2013 anticipated capital expenditures together with amounts for ship construction and related export credit financing were as follows in thousands based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2013 

 

  

   we have orders with meyer werft for two ships for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2017 these ships norwegian escape and norwegian bliss will be the largest in our fleet at approximately 163000 gross tons with 4200 berths each and will be similar in design and innovation to our breakaway class ships the combined contract cost of these two ships is approximately €14 billion or 19 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2013 we have export credit financing in place that provides financing for 80 of their contract price 

in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

capitalized interest for the year ended december 31 2013 was 263 million for the construction of norwegian breakaway norwegian getaway norwegian escape and norwegian bliss capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 221 million and 167 million respectively for the construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway 

  

offbalance sheet transactions 

none 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2013 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

       other 

certain of our service providers may require collateral in the normal course of our business the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions 

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities 

funding sources 

our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends our ships and substantially all other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2013 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets has created a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our existing credit facility and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional equity will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period as a result of the equity infusion from our ipo and the related use of proceeds our leverage was improved and our balance sheet was strengthened there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations 

  

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2013 we had interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2013 38 of our debt was fixed and 62 was variable which includes the effects of the interest rate swap the notional amount of outstanding debt associated with the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2013 was 6604 million based on our december 31 2013 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 194 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of december 31 2013 we had foreign currency derivatives to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the final payments on our ship construction contracts the payments not hedged aggregate €14 billion or 19 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2013 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2013 would result in a 1899 million change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments 

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 183 192 and 166 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and as of december 31 2013 we had hedged approximately 65 53 and 15 of our 2014 2015 and 2016 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2014 fuel expense by 308 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements and fuel collars and options of 163 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

corporate reorganization 

in february 2011 nclh a bermuda exempted limited liability company was formed with the issuance of 10000 ordinary shares at 001 per share on january 24 2013 nclh completed the ipo in connection with the consummation of the ipo nclc’s ordinary shares were exchanged for the ordinary shares of nclh’s and nclh became the owner of 100 of the ordinary shares representing a 973 economic interest and parent company of nclc the “corporate reorganization” the corporate reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure nclh had not prior to the completion of the corporate reorganization conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to preparations for the corporate reorganization and the ipo following the ipo the relative ownership percentages of nclh’s ordinary shares were as follows genting hk 434 the apollo funds 325 the tpg viking funds 108 and public shareholders 133 nclh is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

  

nclc is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the terms of the partnership including the economic rights with respect thereto are set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for nclc economic interests in nclc are represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement which we refer to as “ncl corporation units” the ncl corporation units held by nclh as a result of its ownership of 100 of the ordinary shares of nclc currently represent a 973 economic interest in nclc 

in connection with the corporate reorganization nclc’s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management or former management of nclc including the ordinary profits units described below in “compensation discussion  analysis” were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of ncl corporation units we refer to the ncl corporation units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as “management ncl corporation units” the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests are subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged the management ncl corporation units issued in exchange for the profits interests currently represent a 27 economic interest in nclc 

ncl corporation units are not transferrable without nclh’s prior consent and do not entitle the holders to any voting preemptive or sinking fund rights any distributions other than the tax distributions described below made by nclc are allocated on a pro rata basis to nclh and the holders of the management ncl corporation units based upon the total number of ncl corporation units including management ncl corporation units outstanding distributions by nclc to nclh or holders of management ncl corporation units do not entitle holders of ordinary shares of nclh to any portion of such distribution or to any additional distribution by nclh 

nclc does not have any current plans to make any distributions other than tax distributions which may occur in the future to the extent funds are legally available nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holder the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh 

holders of ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units prior to exchange for ordinary shares of nclh as described below may be entitled to recover on account of the economic interest represented by those units in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event of nclc or nclh even if nclh incurs debt or other claims that are senior to its ordinary shares in contrast the rights of the holders of nclh’s ordinary shares will be potentially junior to the debt or senior claims if any incurred by nclh in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event in this respect the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units may be considered in some cases to be potentially structurally superior to those of the holders of ordinary shares of nclh in a bankruptcy or other insolvency event for nclh and nclc 

subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units will have the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for ordinary shares of nclh at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events any nonpro rata tax distributions made to a management ncl corporation unit holder will reduce the amount of nclh’s ordinary shares or cash that the holder would otherwise receive upon exchange the exchange right described above is subject to i the filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement by nclh that in its determination contains all the information which is required to effect a registered sale of its ordinary shares and ii all applicable legal and contractual restrictions including those imposed by the lockup agreements described elsewhere in this annual report nclh has reserved for issuance a number of its ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units to be outstanding following the expiration of 180day lockup agreements entered into in connection with the ipo nclh intends to file a registration statement with the sec to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elect to exchange 

  

if and when any holder of a management ncl corporation unit exchanges such unit for one of nclh’s ordinary shares or a cash payment equal to the value of one of its ordinary shares the relative economic interests of the exchanging ncl corporation unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of nclh will not be altered no new nclc profits interests or management ncl corporation units will be issued however nclh has granted options to acquire its ordinary shares to our management team under its new longterm incentive plan 

nclh’s executive officers and directors are the same as the executive officers and directors of nclc in effect immediately prior to the corporate reorganization within 90 days following the consummation of the ipo our board of directors “board of directors” will consist of nine directors including five directors designated by the apollo funds two directors designated by genting hk and two independent directors one designated by the apollo funds and one designated by genting hk we refer you to “item 13— certain relationships and related transactions and director independence”

our company 

we are a leading global cruise line operator offering cruise experiences for travelers with a wide variety of itineraries in north america including alaska and hawaii the mediterranean the baltic central america bermuda and the caribbean we strive to offer an innovative and differentiated cruise vacation with the goal of providing our guests the highest levels of overall satisfaction on their cruise experience in turn we aim to generate the highest guest loyalty and greatest numbers of repeat guests we created a distinctive style of cruising called “freestyle cruising” onboard all of our ships which we believe provides our guests with the freedom and flexibility associated with a resort style atmosphere and experience as well as more dining options than a traditional cruise we established the very first private island developed by a cruise line in the bahamas with a diverse offering of activities for guests we are also the only cruise line operator to offer an entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii 

by providing such a distinctive experience and appealing combination of value and service we straddle both the contemporary and premium segments as a result we have been recognized for our achievements as the recipient of multiple honorary awards mainly consisting of reviews tabulated from the readers of travel periodicals such as travel weekly condé nast traveler and travel  leisure we were rated as the favorite cruise line by budget travel and best for family cruises by family circle yahoo travel and today travel in addition we were recognized as europe’s leading cruise line five years in a row by the world travel awards and identified as the cruise line with the best use of a social media platform by travel  leisure our newest ship norwegian epic was recognized as “best overall individual cruise ship” by the travel weekly readers’ choice awards two years in a row 

we offer a wide variety of cruises ranging in length from one day to three weeks during 2012 we docked at approximately 114 ports worldwide with itineraries originating from 15 ports of which 11 are in north america in line with our strategy of innovation many of these north american ports are part of our “homeland cruising” program in which we have homeports that are close to major population centers such as new york boston and miami this reduces the need for vacationers to fly to distant ports to embark on a cruise and helps reduce our guests’ overall vacation cost we offer a wide selection of exotic itineraries outside of the traditional cruising markets of the caribbean and mexico these include cruises in europe including the mediterranean and the baltic bermuda alaska and the industry’s only entirely interisland itinerary in hawaii with our usflagged ship pride of america this itinerary is unparalleled in the cruise industry as all other vessels from competing cruise lines are registered outside the us and are required to dock at a distant foreign port when providing their guests with a hawaiibased cruise itinerary 

each of our 11 modern ships has been purposebuilt to consistently deliver our “freestyle cruising” product offering across our entire fleet which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage by focusing on “freestyle cruising” we have been able to achieve higher onboard spend levels greater customer loyalty and the ability to attract a more diverse clientele 

  

as a result of our strong operating performance over the last four years the growing demand we see for our distinctive cruise offering and the rational supply outlook for the industry we believe that it is an optimal time to add new ships to our fleet in 2010 we placed an order with meyer werft gmbh of papenburg germany “meyer werft” for two new cruise ships norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway which are scheduled for delivery in april 2013 and january 2014 respectively in order to continue to grow the norwegian brand and drive shareholder value most recently in october 2012 we reached an agreement with meyer werft to build a new cruise ship for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2015 with an option to build a second ship with an expected delivery date in spring 2017 currently referred to as “breakaway plus” this new ship will be the largest in our fleet and will be similar in design and innovation to norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway the contract cost of this ship is approximately €6984 million or 9214 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 

as of december 31 2012 we have one of the most modern fleets of cruise ships in the industry among the major north american cruise brands with a weightedaverage age of 81 years following the delivery of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway which are currently under construction we will have the youngest fleet amongst the north american cruise brands these new ships are the next generation of “freestyle cruising” and include some of the most popular elements of our recently delivered ships together with new and differentiated features 

our senior management team has delivered consistent growth and has driven measurable improvements in operating metrics and cash flow generation across several different operating environments under the leadership of our president and chief executive officer kevin m sheehan we significantly differentiated the norwegian brand largely with the “freestyle cruising” concept that accelerated revenue growth and contributed to improving our operating income margins by approximately 1370 basis points since the beginning of 2008 our management team was augmented in key areas such as sales marketing hotel operations and finance and has since implemented major initiatives such as enhancing onboard service and amenities across the fleet expanding our european presence and overseeing a newbuild program that included the successful launch in june 2010 of our largest ship to date norwegian epic 

our industry 

we believe that the cruise industry demonstrates the following positive fundamentals 

strong growth with low penetration and significant upside 

cruising is a vacation alternative with broad appeal as it offers a wide range of products and services to suit the preferences of vacationing guests of all ages backgrounds and interests since 1980 cruising has been one of the fastest growing segments of the north american vacation market according to clia in 2012 approximately 172 million passengers took cruises on clia member lines versus 72 million passengers in 2000 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 75 based on clia’s research we believe that cruising is underpenetrated and represents approximately 12 of the north american vacation market as measured in berths or room count the cruise industry is relatively nascent compared to the wide variety of much more established vacation travel destinations across north america 

according to the orlandoorange county convention  visitors bureau and the las vegas convention and visitors authority there are approximately 268000 rooms in just orlando and las vegas combined by comparison the estimated major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths is approximately 235500 in addition according to industry research only 24 of the us population has ever taken a cruise and we believe this percentage should increase the european vacation market the fastest growing market globally remains underpenetrated by the cruise industry with approximately 1 of europeans having taken a cruise in a given year compared with 3 of the population in the us and canada we believe that improving leisure travel trends along with a relatively low supply outlook in the near term from the major north american cruise brands lead to an attractive business environment for our company to operate in 

  

attractive demographic trends to drive cruising growth 

the cruise market is comprised of a broad spectrum of guests and appeals to virtually all demographic categories based on clia’s 2011 cruise market profile study the target north american cruise market defined as households with income of 40000 or more headed by a person who is at least 25 years old is estimated to be 1329 million people also according to the study the average cruise customer has a household income of 109000 it is our belief that “freestyle cruising” will help us attract the younger generations who we believe are more likely to enjoy greater levels of freedom from our “freestyle cruising” product offering than was traditionally offered within the cruise industry 

significant value proposition and high level of guest satisfaction 

we believe that the cost of a cruise vacation relative to a comparable landbased resort or hotel vacation in orlando or las vegas offers an exceptional value proposition when one considers that a typical cruise for an allinclusive price offers its guests transportation to a variety of destinations hotelstyle accommodations a generous diversity of food choices and a selection of daily entertainment options this is compelling support for the cruise value proposition relative to other leisure alternatives cruises have become even more affordable for a greater number of north american guests over the past few years through the introduction of “homeland cruising” which eliminates the cost of airfare commonly associated with a vacation according to clia’s 2011 study approximately 70 of persons who have taken a cruise rate cruising as a highvalue vacation alternative in this same survey clia reported that approximately 80 of cruise passengers agree that a cruise vacation is a good way to sample various destinations that they may visit again on a landbased vacation 

high barriers to entry 

the cruise industry is characterized by high barriers to entry including the existence of several established and recognizable brands the large investment to build a new sophisticated cruise ship the long lead time necessary to construct new ships and limited newbuild shipyard capacity based on new ship orders announced over the past several years the cost to build a cruise ship can range from approximately 500 million to 14 billion or approximately 200000 to 425000 per berth depending on the ship’s size and quality of product offering the construction time of a newbuild ship is typically between 27 months to 36 months and requires significant upfront cash payments to fund construction costs before revenue is generated in addition the shipbuilding industry is experiencing tightened capacity as the size of ships increases and the industry consolidates with virtually all new capacity added in the last 20 years having been built by one of three major european shipbuilders 

varied segments and brands 

the different cruise lines that make up the global cruise vacation industry have historically been segmented by product offering and service quality into “contemporary” “premium” and “luxury” brands the contemporary segment generally includes cruises on larger ships that last seven days or less provides a casual ambiance and is less expensive on average than the premium or luxury segments the premium segment is generally characterized by cruises that last from seven to 14 nights with a higher quality product offering than the contemporary segment appealing to a more affluent demographic the luxury segment generally offers the highest level of service and quality with longer cruises on the smallest ships in classifying our competitors within the major north american cruise brands the contemporary segment has historically included carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international the premium segment has historically included celebrity cruises holland america and princess cruises we believe that we straddle the contemporary and premium segments as well as offer a unique combination of value and leisure services to cruise guests our brand offers our guests a rich stateroom mix which includes single studios private balconies and luxury suites with personal butler and concierge service as more recently enhanced by the haven as part of our “freestyle cruising” experience we also offer various specialty dining venues some of which are exclusive to our suite and the haven guests based on fleet counts as of december 31 2012 the major north american cruise brands together represent approximately 90 of the north american cruise market as measured by total berths 

  

our competitive strengths 

we believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy 

leading cruise operator with highquality product offering 

we believe that our modern fleet provides us with operational and strategic advantages as our entire fleet has been purposebuilt for “freestyle cruising” with a wider range of passenger amenities relative to many of our competitors 

we believe that in recent years the distinction has been blurred between segments of the market historically known as premium and contemporary with the major north american cruise brands each offering a wide range of onboard experiences across their respective fleets with the completion of our fleet renewal initiative we believe that based on a number of different metrics that directly impact a guest’s onboard experience we compare favorably against the other major north american cruise brands with many product attributes that are more in line with the premium segment 

• modern fleet with a weightedaverage age of 81 years as of december 31 2012 and no ships built before 1998 we have one of the most modern fleets among the major north american cruise brands which we believe allows us to offer a highquality passenger experience with a significant level of consistency across our entire fleet 

• rich stateroom mix as of december 31 2012 48 of our staterooms had private balconies representing a higher mix of outside balcony staterooms than the other contemporary brands in addition five of our ships offer the haven with suites of up to 570 square feet each guests staying in the haven are provided with personal butler service and exclusive access to a private courtyard area with a private pool sundecks hot tubs and a fitness center six of our ships also offer luxury garden suites of up to 6694 square feet making them the largest accommodations at sea 

• highquality service we believe we offer a very high level of onboard service and to further enhance this service we have implemented the norwegian platinum standards program this program introduces specific standards emphasizing dedicated service consistency in execution and overall guest satisfaction which we believe will promote customer loyalty 

• diverse selection of premium itineraries for 2012 approximately 50 of our itineraries by capacity days were in more exotic underpenetrated and less traditional locations including alaska hawaii bermuda and europe compared to the other contemporary brands which are focused primarily on itineraries in the caribbean and mexico this mix of destinations is more consistent with the brands in the premium segment and these itineraries typically attract higher net yields than caribbean and mexico sailings 

we believe that this highquality product offering positions us well in comparison to the other major north american cruise brands and provides an opportunity for continued net yield growth 

“freestyle cruising” 

the most important differentiator for our brand is the “freestyle cruising” concept onboard all 11 of our ships the essence of “freestyle cruising” is to provide a cruise experience that offers more freedom and flexibility than any other traditional cruise alternative while many cruise lines have historically required guests to dine at assigned group tables and at specified times “freestyle cruising” offers the flexibility and choice to our guests who prefer to dine when they want with whomever they want and without having to dress formally additionally we have increased the number of activities and dining facilities available onboard allowing guests to tailor their onboard experience to their own schedules desires and tastes 

all of our ships have been custom designed and purposebuilt for “freestyle cruising” which we believe differentiates us significantly from our major competitors we further believe that “freestyle cruising” attracts a passenger base that prefers the less structured resortstyle experience of our cruises building on the success of “freestyle cruising” we implemented across our fleet “freestyle 20” featuring significant enhancements to our onboard product offering these enhancements include a major investment in the total dining experience upgrading the stateroom experience across the ship new wideranging onboard activities for all ages and additional recognition services and amenities for premiumpriced balcony suite and the haven guests with norwegian epic we have enhanced “freestyle cruising” by offering what we believe to be unmatched flexibility in entertainment offering guests a wide variety of activities and performances to choose from at any time of day or night 

  

established brand recognition 

the norwegian cruise line brand is well established in the cruise industry with a long track record of delivering a world class cruise product offering to its guests we achieve highquality feedback scores from our guests in the areas of overall service physical ship attributes onboard products and services food and beverage offerings and overall entertainment and landbased excursion quality based on recent guest experience and loyalty reports the quality of our guests’ experience generates high levels of customer loyalty as demonstrated by the fact that approximately 33 of our guests are repeat guests and 78 say they would recommend norwegian cruise line to their friends and family brand recognition is also strong with over 92 of cruisers reporting familiarity with norwegian additionally our brand is known for freedom flexibility and choice all highly valued benefits within the cruise industry demographic 

strong cash flow 

nearly all of our capital expenditures other than those related to our newbuild projects which are substantially financed and the recent renovation of our private island relate to the maintenance of our modern fleet and shoreside operations which includes investments in our it infrastructure and business intelligence systems we have obtained export credit financing for breakaway plus norwegian getaway and norwegian breakaway which will fund approximately 80 to 90 of the required predelivery and delivery date construction payments as such we expect the cost of our newbuild projects to have a minimal impact on our cash flow in the near term 

we are able to generate significant levels of cash flow due to our ability to presell tickets and receive customer deposits with long lead times ahead of sailing we also offer our guests the ability to advance book and prepay for certain services in addition we believe that the favorable us federal income tax regime applicable to international shipping income enhances our cash flow from operations which continues to contribute significantly to deleveraging our balance sheet 

highly experienced management team 

our senior management team is comprised of executives with an average of 16 years in the cruise travel leisure and hospitalityrelated industries our executive team has streamlined our organization and instilled a resultsdriven management philosophy that promotes direct accountability and a more nimble decisionmaking culture that contributed in driving approximately 1370 basis points of operating income margin expansion since the beginning of 2008 we believe our stock incentive plan closely aligns the interest of our management team and our stockholders 

strong sponsors with extensive industry expertise 

our sponsors or their affiliates have extensive experience investing in the cruise leisure and travelrelated industries affiliates of the apollo funds have invested significant equity and resources to the cruise and leisure industry with its investment in prestige cruises international inc which operates through two distinct upscale cruise brands oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises in addition affiliates of both apollo and tpg have investments in caesars entertainment corporation “caesars entertainment” with whom we have created a marketing alliance affiliates of tpg are also significant investors in sabre holdings a leading gds global distribution system and parent of travelocitycom genting hk headquartered in hong kong operates a leading asian cruise line through its subsidiary star cruises asia holding ltd with destinations in malaysia singapore hong kong taiwan japan vietnam china and thailand we believe that the synergies and purchasing power obtained through these affiliates have resulted in better price negotiations for us and our affiliates for selected supplies and services 

our business strategies 

we seek to attract vacationers by offering new products and services and creating differentiated itineraries in new markets through new and existing modern ships with the aim of delivering a better valueadded vacation experience to our guests relative to other broadbased or landbased leisure alternatives our business strategies include the following 

  

attractive product offerings 

we have a long history of product development and innovation within the cruise industry as one of the most established consumer brands we became the first cruise operator to purchase a private island in the bahamas and offer a private beach experience to our guests and we were the first to introduce a 2000berth megaship into the caribbean market in 1980 more recently we pioneered new concepts in cruising over the last decade with the development of “homeland cruising” and the launch of “freestyle cruising” 

we continued to enhance our product offering with the delivery of norwegian epic in june 2010 which offers 21 dining options a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea in addition to several differentiated fullservice complimentary dining rooms norwegian epic also features specialty restaurants including a classic steakhouse sushi japanese teppanyaki brazilian churrascaria asian noodle bar traditional chinese fine french and italian guest accommodations on norwegian epic include the groundbreaking studios 128 staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the studio lounge a private twostory lounge for studio guests on its top decks norwegian epic offers a “ship within a ship” in the largest suite complex at sea the haven includes two decks with 60 suites and penthouses a private pool with multiple hot tubs and sundecks a private fitness center and steam rooms fine dining in the epic club restaurant casual outdoor dining at the courtyard grill and 24hour concierge service all exclusively for guests of the haven entertainment onboard norwegian epic includes a wide variety of branded entertainment for guests to choose from including exclusive engagements with blue man group cirque dreams  dinner legends in concert nickelodeon and the improvisational comedy troupe the second city 

building on the success of norwegian epic norwegian breakaway will include many of her most popular elements while maintaining the innovative spirit of “freestyle cruising” by introducing new and differentiated features these include the haven and a quartermile oceanfront boardwalk the waterfront which will create outdoor seating areas for many dining venues and lounges including our first seafood restaurant “ocean blue by geoffrey zakarian” the centrally located “678 ocean place” will connect three entire decks of daytime and nighttime entertainment master baker buddy valastro of the popular tlc series “cake boss” will open an extension of carlo’s bake shop onboard we will offer our guests many of the popular entertainment venues of norwegian epic such as the dueling pianos of “howl at the moon” and new jazz and blues venues and will also feature the 80’sinspired rock musical “rock of ages” ballroom dance experience “burn the floor” and “cirque dreams  dinner jungle fantasy” we have secured a strategic partnership with the radio city rockettes who will christen norwegian breakaway this relationship includes a marketing partnership that names norwegian as the official cruise line of the rockettes and radio city music hall and an exhibit showcasing the rockettes will be integrated into the ship this relationship also includes two rockettes sailing on select voyages and offering special fitness classes and photo opportunities 

we have recently completed a 25 million renovation to our private island great stirrup cay which includes a new marina dining and bar facility to enhance the guest experience as well as offers new activities such as wave runners and private cabanas the enhancements provide us with additional revenuegenerating opportunities on the island 

maximize net yields 

we are focused on growing our revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing our ticket prices and occupancy as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall net yields to maximize passenger ticket revenue our revenue management strategy is focused on optimizing pricing and generating demand throughout the booking curve we utilize a baseloading strategy to fill our capacity by booking guests as early before sailing as possible 

baseloading is a strategy that focuses on selling inventory further from the cruise departure date by utilizing certain sales and marketing tactics which generate business with longer booking windows baseloading allows us to fill our ships earlier which prevents discounting close to sailing dates in order to achieve our targeted occupancy percentages our specific initiatives to achieve this include 

 

   

  

  

 we continue to focus on various initiatives to drive increased onboard revenue across a variety of areas from the year ended december 31 2007 to the year ended december 31 2012 our net onboard and other revenue yield increased by approximately 277 from 4058 to 5184 primarily due to strong performance in casino beverage sales shore excursions and specialty dining our strategy for further driving increased onboard revenue includes among other things generating additional casino revenue through our arrangements with our casino partners including caesars entertainment and genting hk these arrangements incorporate marketing resources to deliver crosscompany advertising and marketing campaigns to promote our brand we also focus on optimizing the utilization of our specialty restaurants and prebooking and preselling additional onboard activities in addition norwegian epic has created additional onboard revenue opportunities based on our premium entertainment offerings 

brand expansion through disciplined newbuild program 

we have three new ships on order and an option to build a fourth all of which would be delivered through 2017 norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway are under construction with meyer werft and are scheduled for delivery in april 2013 and january 2014 respectively and each will approximate 144000 gross tons and 4000 berths with an aggregate cost of approximately €13 billion or 17 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 our financing arrangements provide for financing for approximately 90 of the contract price of these two ships 

in october 2012 we reached an agreement with meyer werft to build a new cruise ship for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2015 with an option to build a second ship with an expected delivery date in spring 2017 currently referred to as “breakaway plus” this new ship will be the largest in our fleet at approximately 163000 gross tons and 4200 berths and will be similar in design and innovation to our current breakaway class ships the contract cost of this ship is approximately €6984 million or 9214 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 we have obtained export credit financing for breakaway plus that provides financing for 80 of the contract price of the ship in addition we have an option in place for export credit financing for the second ship on similar terms we believe that these ships will allow us to continue to expand the reach of our brand while driving shareholder value by positioning our company for accelerated growth with an optimized return on invested capital 

improve operating efficiency and lower costs 

we are continually focused on driving financial improvement through a variety of business improvement initiatives these initiatives are focused on reducing costs while at the same time improving the overall product we deliver to our guests since the beginning of 2008 we have significantly reduced our operating cost base through various programs including contract renegotiations overhead rationalization and fuel consumption reduction initiatives we hedge our fuel purchases in order to provide greater visibility of our fuel expense as of december 31 2012 we had hedged approximately 69 48 and 10 of our projected metric tons of fuel purchases for 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively we have also reduced our maintenance expense as a result of our fleet renewal program as younger more modern ships are typically less costly to maintain than older ships adjusted ebitda grew to 5556 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 3323 million for the year ended 2009 with an increase in adjusted ebitda margin to 244 from 179 respectively we refer you to “item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a calculation of adjusted ebitda in addition we expect the economies of scale from norwegian breakaway norwegian getaway and breakaway plus to drive further operating efficiencies over the long term 

  

expand and strengthen our product distribution channels 

as part of our growth strategy we are continually looking for ways to deepen and expand our customer sales channels we continue to invest in our brand by enhancing our website and our reservation department where our travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations we also restructured our sales and marketing organization which included the recruiting of a new executive leadership team to provide better focus on distribution through our primary channels “retailtravel agent” “international” and “meetings incentives and charters” 

 

  

  

 across every distribution channel we are undertaking a major effort to grow demand with a targeted sales and marketing program for our premium stateroom categories including our balcony and other premium stateroom categories with a particular emphasis on our suites and the haven which have increased as a percentage of our total inventory as a result of our fleet renewal 

our fleet 

our ships are purposebuilt ships that enable us to provide our guests with the ultimate “freestyle cruising” experience our ships have stateofthe art passenger amenities including up to 21 dining options together with hundreds of private balcony staterooms on each ship as of december 31 2012 48 of our staterooms have private balconies representing a higher mix of outside staterooms with balconies than the other contemporary brands private balcony staterooms are very popular with guests and offer the opportunity for increased revenue by allowing us to charge a premium five of our ships offer accommodations in the haven with suites up to 570 square feet which provide personal butler service and exclusive access to a private courtyard area with private pool sundecks hot tubs and fitness center in addition six of our ships have luxury garden suites with up to 6694 square feet making them the largest accommodations at sea these luxury garden suites offer three separate bedroom areas spacious living and dining room areas as well as 24hour oncall butler and concierge service 

  

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols and participates in weekly safety drills onboard every one of our ships in addition our ships utilize operational closed circuit television systems and we use an advanced intranetbased safety and environmental management system “sems” for shipboard and shoreside procedures and selfimprovement standards 

our new ships on order are the nextgeneration of “freestyle cruising” and include some of the most popular elements of our recently delivered ships together with new and differentiated features one such feature is the haven which consists of luxury suites included on our jewelclass ships as well as norwegian epic we are also introducing the waterfront a quartermile oceanfront boardwalk which will create outdoor seating areas for many dining venues and lounges the centrally located “678 ocean place” will connect three entire decks of daytime and nighttime entertainment 

continuing our tradition of new product development and the extension of the norwegian cruise line brand norwegian breakaway will offer our guests many of the popular entertainment venues of norwegian epic such as the dueling pianos of “howl at the moon” and new jazz and blues venues and will also feature the 80’sinspired rock musical “rock of ages” ballroom dance experience “burn the floor” and “cirque dreams  dinner jungle fantasy” norwegian breakaway will homeport yearround in new york city with many elements of new york incorporated into its offerings

the table below provides a brief description of our ships and areas of operation based on 2012 itineraries 

 

  

   

itineraries 

we offer cruise itineraries ranging from one day to three weeks calling on over 100 worldwide locations including destinations in the caribbean bermuda the bahamas mexico alaska europe hawaii new england central america north africa and scandinavia we have developed and are continuing to develop innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the americas and europe for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 50 of our itineraries by capacity days were in more exotic underpenetrated and less traditional locations areas outside of the caribbean and bahamas which we believe allows us to generate higher net yield 

ports and facilities 

we have an agreement with the government of bermuda whereby two of our ships are permitted weekly calls in bermuda through 2018 from boston baltimore charleston and new york in addition we own a private island in the bahamas great stirrup cay which we utilize as a portofcall on some of our itineraries we have a contract with the new york city economic development corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights on specific piers at the city’s passenger ship terminals these preferential berthing rights provide us with the ability to elect specific terminals piers and operating days 15 months in advance of such scheduled future sailings furthermore we have contracts with the port of new orleans and the port of miami pursuant to which we receive preferential berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities’ cruise ship terminals the preferential berthing rights provide us with priority use of selected cruise ship terminals and operating days 12 months in advance of such scheduled future sailings we have a concession permit with the us national park service whereby our ships are permitted to call on glacier bay 22 times through september 30 2019 during each summer cruise season we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary the 25 million renovation to our private island great stirrup cay includes a new dining and bar facility to enhance the guest experience as well as offering new activities such as wave runners and private cabanas the enhancements will provide us with additional revenue generating opportunities on the island 

revenue management practices 

our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities including meals and entertainment in some instances cruise ticket prices include roundtrip airfare to and from the port of embarkation prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place we generate additional revenue on our ships principally from casino operations beverage sales specialty dining shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services and other similar items 

passenger ticket revenue 

we base our ticket pricing and revenue management on a strategy that encourages travelers to book early and secure attractive savings this is accomplished through a revenue management system designed to maximize net yield by matching projected availability to anticipated future passenger demand we perform extensive analyses of our databases in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing stateroom category travel partner market segment itinerary and distribution channel in addition we establish a set of stateroom categories throughout each cruise ship and price our cruise fares on the basis of these stateroom categories typically the initial published fares are established at least 18 months in advance of the departure of a cruise at a level which under normal circumstances would provide a high occupancy if the rate at which stateroom inventory is sold differs from expectations we will raise or lower the prices of each stateroom category accordingly this can be done through promotions special rate codes opening and closing categories or price changes our revenue management tool which is typical of what is used by our major competitors in north america tracks and forecasts overall booking demand and provides optimal pricing and selling limit recommendations on a daily basis the system allows us to better optimize our booking curve and shorten the time to implement pricing decisions and is designed to optimize revenue for the full range of stateroom categories thereby reducing the need for last minute discounting to fill ships 

  

onboard and other revenue 

ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment poolside activities and various sports programs we generate additional revenue on our ships principally from casino operations beverage sales specialty dining shore excursions gift shop purchases spa services and other similar items onboard and other revenue is an important component of our revenue base representing 295 of our 2012 total revenue to maximize onboard revenue we use various cross marketing and promotional tools and are supported by pointofsale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these onboard products and services food and beverage gaming and shore excursions are managed directly by the company while retail shops spa services art auctions and internet services are managed through contracts with thirdparty concessionaires these contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions 

seasonality 

the seasonality of the north american cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the summer months this predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations the seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled drydocks which we typically schedule during nonpeak demand periods 

sales and marketing 

product distribution channels and sales 

we sell our product through our primary distribution channels retailtravel agent international and meetings incentives and charters the retailtravel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales guests utilizing this channel book their cruises through independent travel agents who sell our itineraries on a nonexclusive commissionbased basis given the importance of the retailtravel agent channel a major focus of our marketing strategy is motivating and supporting our travel agent partners our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar internetbased and homebased operators located in north america south america europe asia and australia 

we implemented close to 100 projects specifically designed to improve efficiency with our travel partners and guests ranging from more timely commission payments to aggressive call center quality monitoring we also restructured our travel agent sales force allowing us to more effectively support the larger accounts with specific expertise and also gain access to a significantly larger number of travel partners through an outbound call center 

outside of the us we have an international sales presence in europe and representatives covering latin america australia and asia we are primarily focused on increasing our business in the united kingdom and continental europe markets which have grown significantly in recent years and where we now offer local itineraries yearround we have modified our itineraries to increase demand by appealing to guests in different markets including the united kingdom italy germany and spain we have had success with our baseloading initiatives in europe where our “freestyle cruising” has been well received and are in the process of building our sales force in europe 

finally our meetings incentives and charters channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meeting and incentive travel these sales often have very long lead times and can represent a significant portion of the ship or even an entire sailing in one transaction in addition it strengthens baseloading which allows us to fill our ships earlier rather than discounting close to sailing dates in order to achieve our targeted occupancy percentages 

across all channels we are also undertaking a major effort to grow demand with a targeted sales and marketing program for our premium stateroom categories including the haven which have increased significantly as a percentage of our total inventory as a result of our fleet renewal 

supporting our sales efforts across several distribution channels are our call centers located in florida arizona the united kingdom and germany with approximately 700 personnel oriented towards servicing travel agents we believe that our diverse locations should minimize risks associated with natural disasters labor markets and other factors which could impact the operation of our call centers 

  

marketing brand communications and advertising 

our marketing department works to enhance our brand awareness and increase levels of engagement and understanding of our product and services among consumers trade and travel partners core areas within the department include brand strategy advertising and media marketing communications direct marketing customer loyalty websiteinteractive and market research all marketing supports our comprehensive brand platform created expressly to leverage our unique “freestyle cruising” concept with this emphasis we launched a new brand platform in october 2011 “cruise like a norwegian” which is intended to develop community around norwegian cruise line and communicates our commitment to providing an exceptional vacation experience the media mix has included television print radio digital email and direct mail 

in addition to our ncl university online which is an informative travel partner education program we introduced a new component to our travel partner marketing “partners first” as a result a survey with travel agents indicates we have improved in ease of doing business 

we have made significant progress in expanding our marketing reach with our online products and services our website wwwnclcom serving both our travel agency partners and guests has been a major focus of this momentum we are continually enhancing our website to ensure that it communicates our brand promise promotes relevant product information and aligns with our “cruise like a norwegian” and “freestyle cruising” messages our consumer and travel agency partner booking engine provides travel agency partners and guests the ability to shop and purchase any of our worldwide cruise itineraries with a more intuitive and informative online experience we continue to develop additional functionality and tools to serve our travel agency partners and guests 

sustainable customer loyalty of our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy we believe that attending to our past guests’ needs and motivations creates a costeffective means of attracting business particularly to our new itineraries because past guests are familiar with our brand products and services and often return to our ships the norwegian cruise line loyalty program has been improved and is now known as latitudes rewards improvements to the loyalty program include incentives and rewards allowing people to earn points based on the number of cruise nights level of accommodations and certain booking windows members of this program receive periodic mailings with informative destination information and cruise promotions that include special pricing shipboard credits and onboard recognition also avid cruisers can use our cobranded credit card to earn upgrades and discounts 

customer feedback and research is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies in 2008 we instituted a process for measuring and understanding key drivers of customer loyalty and satisfaction from our guests that provides valuable insights into the cruise experience we regularly initiate custom research studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs andor to solicit feedback that helps shape future direction 

ship operations and cruise infrastructure 

ship maintenance 

in addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements each of our ships is generally taken out of service approximately every 24 to 60 months for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work repairs and improvements performed in drydock drydock duration is a statutory requirement controlled under the chapters of solas and to some extent the international load lines convention under these regulations it is required that a passenger ship drydock twice in 5 years and the maximum duration between each drydock cannot exceed 3 years however most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the bahamas flag state after meeting certain criteria set forth by the bahamas to drydock once every 5 years to the extent practical each ship’s crew catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the drydock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work we do not earn revenue while ships are drydocked accordingly drydock work is typically performed during nonpeak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service drydocks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability 

suppliers 

our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition our largest operating expenditures are for fuel food and beverage travel agent services and advertising and marketing most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices in addition owing to the large quantities that we purchase we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies our purchases are denominated primarily in us dollars payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry 

  

crew and passenger safety 

we place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew we operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of the solas convention and the international safety management code maritime standards the international safety requirements which govern the cruise industry every crew member is well trained in the company’s stringent safety protocols participating in weekly safety drills onboard every one of our ships 

our captains are experienced seafarers we further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous simulation training on navigation and bridge operations to assist our captains and officers while at sea we have extensive navigation protocols in place our bridge operations are based on a twoperson team approach accordingly there are always two officers in charge of bridge operations mandating strict adherence to operating procedures furthermore our bridge teams follow preset voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals in addition all of our ships employ the latest stateoftheart navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary 

prior to every cruise setting sail we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated we also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems in recent years our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits we have installed hifog sprinklers in the engine rooms of the ships in our fleet as required by the imo regulation the navigation centers on our ships are also equipped with voyage data recorders “vdrs” which are similar in concept to the black boxes used in commercial aircraft the vdrs permit us to analyze safety incidents our ships utilize operational closed circuit television systems that enhance our training assist in investigations and support the safety of guests and crew 

we have developed the safety and environmental management system “sems” this advanced intranetbased system establishes the policies procedures training qualification quality compliance audit and selfimprovement standards for all employees both shipboard and shoreside it also provides realtime reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions through this system our senior managers as well as ship management can focus on consistent high quality operation of the fleet the sems is approved and audited annually by our classification society det norske veritas dnv and the system also undergoes regular internal audits as well as an annual audit by the us coast guard we screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments we believe that we are in compliance with current health and safety rules and regulations 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 2100 fulltime employees worldwide in our shoreside operations we also employed approximately 11700 shipboard employees also we refer you to “risk factors— amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may adversely affect our financial results” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place 

insurance 

we maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship the coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the european and us insurance markets 

  

in addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships discussed above we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accidentrelated risks involved in the conduct of our business we carry 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that all of our insurance coverage including those noted above is subject to marketstandard limitations exclusions and deductible levels 

the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1974 the “athens convention” and the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea 1976 the “1976 protocol” are generally applicable to passenger ships the us has not ratified the athens convention however with limited exceptions the 1976 protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a us port the international maritime organization diplomatic conference agreed to a new protocol to the athens convention on november 1 2002 the “2002 protocol” the 2002 protocol which has not yet entered into force establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer the timing of the entry into force of the 2002 protocol if achieved at all is unknown no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level and type of coverage required under the 2002 protocol if the 2002 protocol enters into force we expect insurance costs would increase 

on december 31 2012 the eu passenger liability regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident 

trademarks 

we own a number of registered trademarks relating to among other things the names “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” the names of our ships except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “the haven by norwegian” in addition we own registered trademarks relating to the “freestyle” family of names including “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” other significant marks include our school of fish design marks that display one fish swimming against a school of fish we believe our “norwegian cruise line” “cruise like a norwegian” “the haven by norwegian” “freestyle cruising” “freestyle dining” and “freestyle vacation” the names of our ships as well as the school of fish design and cruise like a norwegian logos are widely recognized throughout north america and europe and have considerable value 

competition 

we compete in the multinight global cruise vacation industry although this sector has grown significantly over the past decade it still remains a relatively small part of the broadly defined global vacation market that has historically been dominated by landbased vacation alternatives the different cruise brands that make up the global cruise vacation industry historically have been segmented by product offering and service quality into contemporary premium and luxury cruises the contemporary segment generally includes cruises on larger ships that last seven 

  

days or less provides a casual ambiance and is less expensive than the premium or luxury segments the premium segment generally is characterized by cruises that last from seven to 14 nights with a higher quality product offering than the contemporary segment appealing to a more affluent demographic the luxury segment generally offers the highest level of services and quality with longer cruises on the smallest ships we compete primarily with the other major north american cruise brands which together comprise approximately 90 of the north american cruise market as measured by total berths these brands include carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international which comprise the contemporary segment and holland america princess cruises and celebrity cruises which are part of the premium segment as of december 31 2012 norwegian cruise line accounted for approximately 11 of the major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths we compete against all of these operators principally on the quality of our ships our differentiated product offering selection of our itineraries and value proposition of our cruises we also face competition from noncruise vacation alternatives including beach resorts golf and tennis resorts theme parks landbased gaming operations and other hotels and tourist destinations 

regulatory issues 

registration of our ships 

ten of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the bahamas one of our ships pride of america  is a usflagged ship our ships registered in the bahamas are inspected at least annually pursuant to bahamian requirements our usregistered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the us federal government and to various us federal regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us public health service and the us coast guard our usflagged ship is also regulated by the food and drug administration “fda” and us department of labor 

our entire fleet is also subject to the health and safety laws and regulations of the various port locales where the ships dock the us and the bahamas are members of the imo and have adopted and implemented the imo conventions relating to oceangoing passenger ships us law generally requires ships transporting passengers exclusively between and among ports in the us to be built entirely in the us documented under us law crewed by americans and owned by entities that are at least 75 owned and controlled by us citizens we have been granted specific authority to operate in and among the islands of hawaii under legislation known as the “hawaii cruise ship provision” which was part of the “consolidated appropriations resolution 2003” enacted in 2003 public law 1087 division b title ii general provisions—department of commerce section 211 february 20 2003 117 stat 1179 the hawaii cruise ship provision permitted two partially completed ships originally contracted for construction in a us shipyard by an unrelated party to be completed in a shipyard outside of the us and documented under the us flag even if the owner does not meet the 75 us ownership requirement provided that the direct owning entity is organized under the laws of the us and meets certain us citizen officer and director requirements presently only one of the two ships completed in compliance with the hawaii cruise ship provision pride of america operates as a usflagged ship the other pride of hawai’i was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian jade the hawaii cruise ship provision also authorized the redocumentation under the us flag of one additional foreignbuilt cruise ship for operation between us ports in the islands of hawaii pride of aloha in may 2008 pride of aloha was transferred to the bahamas registry and operates as norwegian sky the hawaii cruise ship provision imposes certain requirements including that any nonwarranty work be performed in the us except in case of emergency or lack of availability and that the ship operates primarily between and among the islands of hawaii as a result of this exemption our usflagged ship deployed in hawaii is able to cruise between us ports in hawaii without the need to call at a foreign port 

health and environment 

our various ports of call subject our ships to international and us laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including but not limited to marpol under such laws and regulations we are prohibited from among other things discharging certain materials such as petrochemicals and plastics into the waterways specifically in the us we comply with the newly implemented us environmental protection agency’s vessel general discharge permit 

also in the us we must meet the us public health service’s requirements including ratings by inspectors from the centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and the fda we believe we rate at the top of the range of cdc and fda scores achieved by the major cruise lines in addition the cruise industry and the us public health service have agreed on regulations for food water and hygiene to assist cruise lines in achieving the highest health and sanitation standards on cruise ships 

  

in 2012 we received our international organization for standardization’s “iso” 90012008 certification which is the primary globally accepted standard for quality assurance and quality performance this is a milestone which sets the stage for quality operations and guest satisfaction furthermore norwegian is certified under the iso 14001 standard this voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations currently we operate under an environmental management plan that is incorporated into the sems program 

pursuant to fmc and us coast guard regulations we have covered our financial responsibility with respect to death or injury to passengers and water pollution by providing required guarantees from our insurers with respect to such potential liabilities this includes obtaining certificates of financial responsibility required by the us coast guard relating to our ability to satisfy liabilities in cases of water pollution 

permits for glacier bay alaska 

in connection with certain of our alaska cruise operations we rely on concession permits from the us national park service to operate our ships in glacier bay national park and preserve we currently hold a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through september 30 2019 however there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future 

security and safety 

pursuant to provisions adopted by the imo all cruise ships were required to be certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the international management code for the safe operation of ships and for pollution prevention “ism code” we have obtained certificates certifying that our ships are in compliance with the ism code each such certificate is granted for a fiveyear period and is subject to periodic verification 

we believe that our ships currently comply with all requirements of the imo and the us and bahamian flags including but not limited to solas marpol and stcw the solas requirements are amended and extended by the imo from time to time for example the international port and ship facility code “isps code” was adopted by the imo in december 2002 and provides for measures strengthening maritime security and places new requirements on governments port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports we comply with the isps code 

in addition to the requirements of the isps code the us congress enacted the maritime transportation security act of 2002 “mtsa” which implements a number of security measures at ports in the us including measures that apply to ships registered outside the us docking at ports in the us the us coast guard has published mtsa regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the us provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships we believe our fleet is in compliance with the requirements imposed upon it by the mtsa and the us coast guard regulations the transportation workers identification credential is a federal requirement for accessibility into and onto us ports and usflagged ships we are in compliance with this requirement 

amendments to solas required that ships constructed in accordance with pre1974 solas requirements install automatic sprinkler systems by december 31 2005 failure to comply with the solas requirements with respect to any ship will among other things restrict the operations of such ship in the us and many other jurisdictions we are in compliance with these requirements 

imo adopted an amendment to solas which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of noncombustible construction existing ships are required to comply with this solas amendment by the first statutory survey after july 1 2008 all of our ships are in compliance with the solas amendment the new solas regulation on longrange identification and tracking “lrit” entered into force on january 1 2008 this allows solas contracting governments a year to set up and test the lrit system and ship operators a year to start fitting 

  

the necessary equipment or upgrading so that their ships can transmit lrit information ships constructed on or after december 31 2008 must be fitted with a system to automatically transmit the identity of the ship the position of the ship latitude and longitude and the date and time of the position ships constructed before december 31 2008 must be fitted with the equipment not later than the first survey of the radio installation after december 31 2008 we are in compliance with these requirements 

financial requirements 

the fmc requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of us ports to indemnify passengers in the event of nonperformance of the transportation accordingly we are required to maintain a 150 million thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to passengers proposed regulations would revise the financial requirements with respect to both deathinjury and nonperformance coverages also we have a legal requirement for us to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the united kingdom and have a bond with the association of british travel agents currently valued at british pound sterling 32 million we also are required to establish financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of nonperformance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions 

taxation 

taxation of operating income in general 

this discussion is based on the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” existing final and temporary regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions all as in effect on the date of this filing and all of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below the following discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the us federal income tax considerations applicable to us 

unless exempt from us federal income taxation a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income tax in respect of any income that is derived from the use of vessels from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses collectively referred to as “shipping income” to the extent that the shipping income is derived from sources within the us 

for these purposes shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends but that does not both begin and end in the us which we refer to as ussource international shipping income will be considered to be 50 derived from sources within the us 

the legislative history of the transportation income source rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a us port but that calls on one or more foreign ports will derive ussource income only from the first and last legs of such cruise however since there are no us treasury regulations or other us internal revenue service “irs” guidance with respect to these rules the applicability of the transportation income source rules described above is not free from doubt 

no portion of shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between nonus ports will be considered to be derived from sources within the us such shipping income will not be subject to any us federal income tax shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between us ports will be considered to be 100 derived from us sources 

unless exempt from tax under section 883 of the code i any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business “effectively connected income” as discussed below under “—taxation in absence of section 883 exemption” would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis generally at a 35 rate and state and local taxes and nclh’s effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30 the “net tax regime” and ii if not considered to be effectively connected income any ussource income would be subject to a 4 tax on gross income provided under section 887 of the code the “4 regime” 

  

the ussource portion of our income that is not shipping income including our usflagged operations is generally subject to the net tax regime us treasury regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and to the extent derived from us sources are subject to us federal income taxes income items considered nonincidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of singleday cruises shore excursions air and other transportation and preand postcruise land packages we believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income 

to the extent funds are legally available the tax agreement governing the ncl corporation units provides that nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to the holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holder the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh generally these tax distributions will be computed based on an estimate of the taxable income determined for us federal income tax purposes allocable to the ncl corporation unit holder multiplied by the us federal and state income tax rate applicable to each holder as determined in the sole discretion of nclh 

exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation 

under section 883 of the code and the related regulations a foreign corporation will be exempt from us federal income taxation on its ussource international shipping income if a it is organized in a qualified foreign country which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the us in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section 883 of the code and to which we refer as the “country of organization test” and b either 1 more than 50 of the value of its stock is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by “qualified shareholders” which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country to which we refer as the “50 ownership test” 2 one or more classes of its stock representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us and certain exceptions do not apply to which we refer as the “publicly traded test” or 3 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” and it satisfies an ownership test to which collectively we refer as the “cfc test” in addition us treasury regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements 

bermuda the jurisdiction where we are incorporated has been officially recognized by the irs as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax in respect of each category of shipping income we expect to earn in the future therefore nclh will satisfy the country of organization test and will likely be exempt from us federal income taxation with respect to our ussource international shipping income if nclh is able to satisfy any one of the 50 ownership test the publicly traded test or the cfc test as discussed further below as of the date of this filing we expect to satisfy the publicly traded test 

the regulations under section 883 of the code provide in pertinent part that a corporation will meet the publicly traded test if one or more classes of stock of a foreign corporation representing in the aggregate more than 50 of the combined voting power and value of all classes of stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the us a class of stock will be considered to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of such class of stock that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares of such stock that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country 

under the regulations a class of stock will be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market if a such class of stock is listed on such market b such class of stock is traded on such market other than in minimal quantities on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one sixth of the days in a short taxable year and c the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10 of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year 

  

the regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if a class of stock is traded on an established securities market in the us and is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such stock 

the regulations provide in pertinent part that a class of stock will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50 or more of the outstanding shares of such class of stock are owned on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5 or more of the outstanding shares of such class of stock to which we refer as the “five percent override rule” the “five percent override rule” will not apply if we can substantiate that the number of nclh’s ordinary shares owned for more than half of the number of days in the taxable year 1 directly or indirectly applying attribution rules by its qualified shareholders and 2 by its non5 shareholders is greater than 50 of its outstanding ordinary shares 

as of the date of this filing we expect that we will be eligible to claim the section 883 tax exemption on the basis of the publicly traded test since nclh’s ordinary shares are traded on the nasdaq global select market which is considered to be an established securities market nclh expects that its ordinary shares will be deemed to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market furthermore we believe nclh will meet the trading volume requirements described previously because the pertinent regulations provide that trading volume requirements will be deemed to be met with respect to a class of equity traded on an established securities market in the us where the class of equity is regularly quoted by dealers who regularly and actively make offers purchases and sales of such equity to unrelated persons in the ordinary course of business 

as of the date of this filing nclh’s direct 5 shareholders may own more than 50 of its ordinary shares nevertheless we believe and have obtained substantiation supporting such belief that the number of nclh’s ordinary shares owned by its non5 shareholders and nclh’s qualified shareholders is greater than 50 of its total outstanding ordinary shares based on the foregoing as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh’s ordinary shares will be considered to be “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” and that nclh and each of its corporate subsidiaries in which nclh owns more than 50 of the value of the outstanding stock and that is organized in a qualifying foreign country will therefore qualify for the section 883 tax exemption however there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares or the status of certain of its qualified shareholders which could cause nclh or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption therefore we can give no assurance in this regard should any of the facts described above cease to be correct or the direct or indirect ownership of nclh’s ordinary shares change nclh and its subsidiaries’ ability to qualify for the section 883 tax exemption will be compromised also it should be noted that section 883 of the code has been the subject of legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its availability to certain taxpayers and there can be no assurance that future legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of section 883 of the code 

in addition because nclh is relying on the substantial ownership by non5 shareholders in order to satisfy the regularly traded test there is the potential that if another shareholder becomes a 5 shareholder our qualification under the publicly traded test could be jeopardized if nclh were to fail to satisfy the publicly traded test we could be subject to us income tax on income associated with our cruise operations in the us therefore as a precautionary matter nclh has provided protections in its byelaws to reduce the risk of the five percent override rule applying in this regard nclh’s byelaws provide that no one person or group of related persons other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk may own or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code more than 49 of its ordinary shares whether measured by vote value or number unless such ownership is approved by its board of directors in addition any person or group of related persons that own 3 or more or a lower percentage if required by the us treasury regulations under the code of nclh’s ordinary shares will be required to meet certain notice requirements as provided for in its byelaws nclh’s byelaws generally restrict the transfer of any of its ordinary shares if such transfer would cause nclh to be subject to us shipping income tax in general detailed attribution rules that treat a shareholder as owning shares that are owned by certain other persons are applied in determining whether a person is a 5 shareholder 

for purposes of the 49 limit a “transfer” includes any sale transfer gift assignment devise or other disposition whether voluntary or involuntary whether of record constructively or beneficially and whether by operation of law or otherwise the 49 limit does not apply to the apollo funds the tpg viking funds or genting hk these shareholders are permitted to transfer their shares without complying with the limit subject to certain restrictions we refer you to “certain relationships and related transactions—the shareholders’ agreement” 

  

nclh’s byelaws provide that its board of directors may waive the 49 limit or transfer restrictions in any specific instance the board of directors may also terminate the limit and transfer restrictions generally at any time for any reason if a purported transfer or other event results in the ownership of ordinary shares by any shareholder in violation of the 49 limit or causes nclh to be subject to us income tax on shipping operations such ordinary shares in excess of the 49 limit or which would cause nclh to be subject to us shipping income tax will automatically be designated as “excess shares” to the extent necessary to ensure that the purported transfer or other event does not result in ownership of ordinary shares in violation of the 49 limit or cause nclh to become subject to us income tax on shipping operations and any proposed transfer that would result in such an event would be void any purported transferee or other purported holder of excess shares will be required to give nclh written notice of a purported transfer or other event that would result in excess shares the purported transferee or holders of such excess shares shall have no rights in such excess shares other than a right to the payments described below 

excess shares will not be treasury shares but rather will continue to be issued and outstanding ordinary shares while outstanding excess shares will be transferred to a trust the trustee of such trust will be appointed by nclh and will be independent of nclh and the purported holder of the excess shares the beneficiary of such trust will be one or more charitable organizations that is a qualified shareholder selected by the trustee the trustee will be entitled to vote the excess shares on behalf of the beneficiary if after a purported transfer or other event resulting in excess shares and prior to the discovery by us of such transfer or other event dividends or distributions are paid with respect to such excess shares such dividends or distributions will be immediately due and payable to the trustee for payment to the charitable beneficiary all dividends received or other income declared by the trust will be paid to the charitable beneficiary upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of nclh the purported transferee or other purported holder will receive a payment that reflects a price per share for such excess shares generally equal to the lesser of 

• the amount per share of any distribution made upon such liquidation dissolution or winding up and 

• in the case of excess shares resulting from a purported transfer the price per share paid in the transaction that created such excess shares or in the case of excess shares resulting from an event other than a purported transfer the market price for the excess shares on the date of such event 

at the direction of nclh’s board of directors the trustee will transfer the excess shares held in trust to a person or persons including nclh whose ownership of such excess shares will not violate the 49 limit or otherwise cause nclh to become subject to us shipping income tax within 180 days after the later of the transfer or other event that resulted in such excess shares or we become aware of such transfer or event if such a transfer is made the interest of the charitable beneficiary will terminate the designation of such shares as excess shares will cease and the purported holder of the excess shares will receive the payment described below the purported transferee or holder of the excess shares will receive a payment that reflects a price per share for such excess shares equal to the lesser of 

• the price per share received by the trustee and 

• the price per share such purported transferee or holder paid in the purported transfer that resulted in the excess shares or if the purported transferee or holder did not give value for such excess shares through a gift devise or other event a price per share equal to the market price on the date of the purported transfer or other event that resulted in the excess shares 

a purported transferee or holder of the excess shares will not be permitted to receive an amount that reflects any appreciation in the excess shares during the period that such excess shares were outstanding any amount received in excess of the amount permitted to be received by the purported transferee or holder of the excess shares must be turned over to the charitable beneficiary of the trust if the foregoing restrictions are determined to be void or invalid by virtue of any legal decision statute rule or regulation then the intended transferee or holder of any excess shares may be deemed at nclh’s option to have acted as an agent on its behalf in acquiring or holding such excess shares and to hold such excess shares on nclh’s behalf 

nclh has the right to purchase any excess shares held by the trust for a period of 90 days from the later of 

• the date the transfer or other event resulting in excess shares has occurred and 

  

• the date nclh’s board of directors determines in good faith that a transfer or other event resulting in excess shares has occurred 

the price per excess share to be paid by nclh will be equal to the lesser of 

• the price per share paid in the transaction that created such excess shares or in the case of certain other events the market price per share for the excess shares on the date of such event or 

• the lowest market price for the excess shares at any time after their designation as excess shares and prior to the date nclh accepts such offer 

these provisions in nclh’s byelaws could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in our control or other transaction in which nclh’s shareholders might receive a premium for their ordinary shares over the thenprevailing market price or which such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest the board of directors may determine in its sole discretion to terminate the 49 limit and the transfer restrictions of these provisions while both the mandatory offer protection and 49 protection remain in place no third party other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds or genting hk will be able to acquire control of nclh 

taxation in absence of section 883 exemption 

if nclh does not qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code as described above i any ussourced shipping income or any other income that is effectively connected income as described below would be subject to the net tax regime and ii if not considered to be effectively connected income any ussource income would be subject to the 4 regime 

nclh’s ussource international shipping income would be considered effectively connected income only if it has or is considered to have a fixed place of business in the us involved in the earning of ussource international shipping income and substantially all of its ussource international shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the us this would likely be the case 

us taxation of gain on sale of vessels 

provided we and our subsidiaries qualify for exemption from tax under section 883 of the code in respect of our shipping income gain from the sale of a vessel likewise should generally be exempt from tax under section 883 of the code if however nclh’s gain does not for whatever reason qualify for exemption under section 883 of the code then such gain could be subject to either the net tax regime or 4 regime determined under rules different from those discussed above 

certain state local and nonus tax matters 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law 

  

us federal income taxation—net operating losses 

as a result of the corporate reorganization described above under “corporate reorganization” we obtained certain net operating losses “nols” of our shareholders section 382 of the code places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by nol carryforwards after a change in control generally greater than 50 change in ownership of a loss corporation generally after a change in control a loss corporation cannot deduct nol carryforwards in excess of the section 382 limitation due to these change in ownership provisions utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation in future periods and may be limited to a significant extent use of our nol carryforwards may be further limited as a result of any future equity transaction that results in a greater than 50 change in ownership

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business if any of the risks discussed in this annual report actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in connection with the forwardlooking cautionary statements that appear in this annual report you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements” 

risk factors related to our business 

the specific risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this annual report could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results and individually or any combination thereof could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

the adverse impact of the worldwide economic downturn and related factors such as high levels of unemployment and underemployment fuel price increases declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions that decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence 

the demand for cruises is affected by international national and local economic conditions adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate such as higher fuel prices higher interest rates stock and real estate market declines andor volatility more restrictive credit markets higher taxes and changes in governmental policies could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests for example the worldwide economic downturn has had an adverse effect on consumer confidence and discretionary income resulting in decreased demand and price discounting we cannot predict the duration or magnitude of this downturn or the timing or strength of economic recovery if the downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens we could experience a prolonged period of decreased demand and price discounting in addition the economic downturn has and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers which can result in disruptions in service and financial losses 

an increase in cruise capacity 

historically cruise capacity has grown to meet the growth in demand according to clia cruise capacity in terms of berths has increased from 2000 through 2012 at a compound annual growth rate of 62 clia estimates that between 2013 and 2016 the north america based clia member line fleet will increase by approximately 29 ships representing a compound annual capacity growth of 34 in order to profitably utilize this new capacity the cruise industry will likely need to improve its percentage share of the us population who has cruised at least once which is approximately 24 according to clia if there is an industrywide increase in capacity without a corresponding increase in public demand we as well as the entire cruise industry could experience reduced occupancy rates andor be forced to discount our prices in addition increased cruise capacity could impact our ability to retain and attract qualified shipboard employees including officers at competitive levels and therefore increase our shipboard employee costs 

  

we face intense competition from other cruise companies as well as noncruise vacation alternatives and we may not be able to compete effectively 

we face intense competition from other cruise companies primarily the other major north american cruise brands which together comprise approximately 90 of the north american cruise market as measured by total berths these brands include carnival cruise lines and royal caribbean international in the contemporary segment and holland america princess cruises and celebrity cruises in the premium segment as of december 31 2012 norwegian cruise line accounted for approximately 11 of the major north american cruise brands’ capacity in terms of berths we compete against all of these operators principally on the quality of our ships our differentiated product offering selection of our itineraries and value proposition of our cruises we also face competition for many itineraries from other cruise operators as well as competition from noncruise vacation alternatives in the event we do not compete effectively our business could be adversely affected 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments 

we are highly leveraged with a high level of variable rate debt and our level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition operations prospects and flexibility as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 30 billion of total debt our substantial indebtedness could 

• limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital capital expenditures development projects debt service requirements strategic initiatives or other purposes 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our operations or business 

• make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy 

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities 

• restrict us from taking certain actions by means of restrictive covenants 

• make our credit card processors seek more restrictive terms in respect of our credit card arrangements and 

• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at a variable rate of interest 

based on our december 31 2012 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in the libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 182 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest in addition future financings we may undertake may also provide for rates that fluctuate with prevailing interest rates 

increases in fuel prices andor other cruise operating costs 

fuel expense accounted for 192 of our total cruise operating expense in 2012 166 in 2011 and 154 in 2010 future increases in the cost of fuel globally would increase the cost of our cruise ship operations in addition we could experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control 

  

conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks 

we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks including political risks risks of increase in duties and taxes risks relating to antibribery laws as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreignbased companies because some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies we are exposed to exchange rate risks additional risks include interest rate movements imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 

we have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours would likely contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs 

we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreements if any of the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

under our existing debt agreements we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios a failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreements could result in an event of default under the agreements which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in the event of any default under our existing debt agreements the holders of our indebtedness thereunder 

  

  

  

 such actions by the holders of our indebtedness could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness if we were unable to repay those amounts the holders of our indebtedness under our existing senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness if the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

despite our substantial indebtedness we may still be able to incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may be able to incur substantial indebtedness at any time in the future although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon among other things 

 

  

 there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under certain of our existing senior secured credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations in addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all furthermore any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due neither our sponsors nor any of their respective affiliates has any continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 

the impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks including those under our credit facilities derivative instruments contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow additional money on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all as a result of the global credit crisis certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy have sold some or all of their assets or may be looking to enter into merger or other transaction with another financial institution consequently some of the counterparties under our credit facilities derivatives contingent obligations insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees may be unable to perform their obligations or may breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them which could include 

  

failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements also we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties under our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements if we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument 

terrorist acts acts of piracy armed conflict and threats thereof and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for cruises 

past acts of terrorism have had an adverse effect on tourism travel and the availability of air service and other forms of transportation the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts an outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict abroad or the possibility thereof the issuance of travel advisories by national governments and other geopolitical uncertainties have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on the demand for cruises and consequently the pricing for cruises decreases in demand and reduced pricing in response to such decreased demand would adversely affect our business by reducing our profitability 

we rely on external distribution channels for passenger bookings and major changes in the availability of external distribution channels could undermine our customer base 

in 2012 the majority of our guests booked their cruises through independent travel agents in the event that the travel agent distribution channel is adversely impacted by the worldwide economic downturn or other reason this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises and we could be forced to increase the use of alternative distribution channels 

we rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger connections and increases in the price of or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services could undermine our customer base 

a number of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices or other factors would increase the overall vacation cost to our guests and may adversely affect demand for our cruises changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes weather or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests to our cruises andor increase our cruise operating expense 

any delays in the construction and delivery of a cruise ship 

delays in the construction repair refurbishment and delivery of a cruise ship can occur as a result of events such as insolvency work stoppages other labor actions or “force majeure” events experienced by our shipbuilders and other such companies that are beyond our control any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us potential claims and impairment of losses a significant delay in the delivery of a new ship or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship particularly in light of decreasing availability of drydock facilities could have an adverse effect on our business 

future epidemics and viral outbreaks 

public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to passenger or crew illness such as incidents of h1n1 stomach flu or other contagious diseases may impact demand for cruises if any wideranging health scare should occur our business would likely be adversely affected 

the political environment in certain countries where we operate is uncertain and our ability to operate our business as we have in the past may be restricted 

we operate in waters and call at ports throughout the world including geographic regions that from time to time have experienced political and civil unrest as well as insurrection and armed hostilities adverse international events could affect demand for cruise products generally and could have an adverse effect on us 

  

adverse incidents involving cruise ships 

the operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions maritime disaster including but not limited to oil spills and other environmental mishaps fire mechanical failure collisions human error war terrorism piracy political action civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events any such event may result in loss of life or property loss of revenue or increased costs the operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port including missing guests inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes that may bring into question passenger safety may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us although we place passenger safety as the highest priority in the design and operation of our fleet we have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future it is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased port related and other costs resulting from such adverse events any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight an adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us anything that damages our reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about passenger safety could have an adverse impact on demand which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales 

there can be no assurance that all risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid such losses to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance could affect our financial results in addition we have been and continue to be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us which could reduce our cash flows if we were to sustain significant losses in the future our ability to obtain insurance coverage or coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected 

breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results 

the integrity and reliability of our information technology systems and other networks are crucial to our business operations we have made significant investments in our information technology systems to optimize booking procedures enhance the marketing power of our website and control costs any unauthorized use of our information systems to gain access to sensitive information corrupt data or create general disturbances in our operations systems could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation while we have information technology security and recovery plans in place we cannot completely insulate ourselves from cyberrelated risks 

amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may adversely affect our financial results 

currently we are a party to six collective bargaining agreements three of these agreements were recently renegotiated and are in effect through 2014 of the three remaining collective bargaining agreements two are scheduled to expire in 2018 and one is scheduled to expire in 2020 upon appropriate notice the agreements may be reopened at certain yearly intervals and we received notice from two of the parties to reopen wagebenefit negotiations in 2012 these negotiations were completed and effective from april 2012 without material cost to the company any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition in addition our collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

unavailability of ports of call 

we believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to existing capacity constraints security concerns adverse weather conditions and natural disasters financial limitations on port development local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our business 

  

the loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel 

we rely upon the ability expertise judgment discretion integrity and good faith of our senior management team our success is dependent upon our personnel and our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth the loss of services of any of the key members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business see “management” for additional information about our management personnel 

the leadership of our president and chief executive officer mr sheehan and other executive officers has been a critical element of our success the death or disability of mr sheehan or other extended or permanent loss of his services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss could have a material adverse effect on our business our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us we are not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us 

we are controlled by the sponsors who hold a significant percentage of nclh’s ordinary shares and whose interests may not be aligned with ours 

the majority of nclh’s voting ordinary shares are held by affiliates of genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds the shareholders’ agreement governing the relationship among those parties gives the apollo funds effective control over our affairs and policies subject to certain limitations genting hk and the apollo funds also control the election of our board of directors the appointment of management the entering into of mergers sales of substantially all of our assets and other material transactions the directors appointed by genting hk and the apollo funds have the authority on our behalf and subject to the terms of our debt agreements and the shareholders’ agreement to issue additional ordinary shares implement share repurchase programs declare dividends pay advisory fees and make other decisions and they may have an interest in our doing so 

furthermore genting hk engages in the cruise industry and leisure entertainment and hospitality activities and apollo and tpg are in the business of managing investment funds which make investments in companies and one or more of which has now and may from time to time acquire hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us as well as businesses that represent major guests of our business investment funds managed by genting hk apollo andor tpg may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as nclh’s current shareholders continue to control a significant amount of its outstanding voting ordinary shares such shareholders will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions additionally the concentration of ownership held by nclh’s current shareholders could delay defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger takeover or other business combination 

risks related to the regulatory environment in which we operate 

future changes in applicable tax laws or our inability to take advantage of favorable tax regimes 

we believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income “shipping income” is exempt from us federal income taxes under section 883 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “item 1—business—regulatory issues—taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” the provisions of section 883 of the code are subject to change at any time possibly with retroactive effect 

  

we believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of nonqualifying income it is possible however that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify or will not qualify as shipping income moreover the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which nclh will satisfy complex stock ownership tests under section 883 of the code as described in “item 1—business— regulatory issues— taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” there are factual circumstances beyond our control including changes in the direct and indirect owners of nclh’s ordinary shares that could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption finally any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the net tax regime or the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1—business—taxation of operating income in general” and we can give no assurances on this matter 

if we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under section 883 of the code our or such subsidiary’s ussource income would be subject to either the net tax regime or to the 4 regime each as defined in “item 1— business— regulatory issues— taxation—taxation of operating income in general” as of the date of this filing we believe that nclh and its subsidiaries will satisfy the stock ownership tests imposed under section 883 and therefore believe that nclh will qualify for the exemption under section 883 

however as discussed above there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause nclh to not meet the stock ownership tests therefore we can give no assurances on this matter we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues— taxation—exemption of operating income from us federal income taxation” 

we may be subject to state local and nonus income or nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions including those in which we transact business own property or reside we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions our state local or nonus tax treatment may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed above we may be required to pay nonus taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to nonus income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial 

the various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income these tax regimes however are subject to change moreover we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue 

some environmental groups have lobbied for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations on environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations the us environmental protection agency the imo a united nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships the council of the european union and individual states are considering as well as implementing new laws and rules to manage cruise ship waste in addition many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to governmental regulation by the us coast guard as well as international treaties such as the international convention for the safety of life at sea “solas” an international safety regulation the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships “marpol” an international environmental regulation and the standard of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers “stcw” and its recently adopted conventions in ship manning international regulations regarding ballast water and security levels are currently pending additionally the us and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions including those of green house gases compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures which could adversely impact our operations as well as our competitors’ operations in addition the state of alaska approved stringent regulations in 2008 concerning waste water discharge in 2010 alaska issued a final permit that regulates discharges of treated wastewater from cruise ships for the summer tourist seasons running from 2010 to 2012 the permit provides for the cruise companies to gather data on performance of new shipboard environmental control systems that will allow a scientific review committee to advise state officials on improving the regulations the international labor organization’s maritime labor convention 2006 is expected to become international law on august 20 2013 now that thirty member countries with a total share of at least 33 of the world gross tonnage of ships have signed the agreement it will regulate many aspects of maritime crew labor and will impact the worldwide sourcing of new crewmembers 

  

these issues are and we believe will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 

by virtue of our operations in the us the us federal maritime commission “fmc” requires us to maintain a thirdparty performance guarantee on our behalf in respect of liabilities for nonperformance of transportation and other obligations to guests the fmc has proposed rules that would significantly increase the amount of our required guarantees and accordingly our cost of compliance there can be no assurance that such an increase in the amount of our guarantees if required would be available to us for additional discussion of the fmc’s proposed requirements we refer you to “item 4—information on the company—regulatory issues” 

in 2007 the state of alaska implemented taxes which have impacted the cruise industry operating in alaska it is possible that other states countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees andor guests which could increase our operating costs andor could decrease the demand for cruises 

changes in health safety security and other regulatory issues 

we are subject to various international national state and local health safety and security laws and regulations for additional discussion of these requirements we refer you to “item 1—business—regulatory issues” changes in existing legislation or regulations and the imposition of new requirements could adversely affect our business 

implementation of us federal regulations requiring us citizens to obtain passports for seaborne travel to all foreign destinations could adversely affect our business many cruise guests may not currently have passports or may not obtain a passport card previously known as the people access security service card or pass card as an alternative to a passport this card was created to meet the documentary requirements of the western hemisphere travel initiative applications for the card have been accepted since february 1 2008 and the cards were made available to the public beginning in july 2008 

we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march 31 2035 which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

under current bermuda law we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains we have received from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act 1966 as amended an assurance that in the event that bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits income any capital asset gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares debentures or other obligations until march 31 2035 we could be subject to taxes in bermuda after that date this assurance is subject to the proviso that it is not to be construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in bermuda or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to us we pay annual bermuda government fees 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of nasdaq and as a result rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 

on january 18 2013 nclh listed its ordinary shares on the nasdaq global select market and genting hk the apollo funds and the tpg viking funds or their respective affiliates together continue to control a majority of its ordinary shares as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of a national securities exchange under the rules of a national securities exchange a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirement 

 

  

  

   

 nclh has utilized these exemptions as a result nclh does not have a majority of independent directors nor is nclh required to have any independent directors on its nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees and nclh is not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominatingcorporate governance and compensation committees accordingly its shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to a national securities exchange’s general corporate governance requirements without giving effect to the “controlled company” exemptions 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

shareholders of our company may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than as shareholders of a us corporation 

we are a bermuda exempted company the companies act 1981 of bermuda the “companies act” which applies to our company differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders taken together with the provisions of our byelaws some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of our company than you would have as a shareholder of a us corporation this affects among other things the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a whollyowned subsidiary what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the companies act or our byelaws and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers 

the market price for our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations 

the market price for our ordinary shares could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares 

  

the substantial number of ordinary shares that will be eligible for sale in the near future may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 

we have an aggregate of 203997492 ordinary shares issued and outstanding our ordinary shares sold in the ipo were eligible for immediate resale in the public market without restrictions and those held by our controlling shareholders and key employees may also be sold in the public market in the future subject to applicable lockup agreements as well as the restrictions contained in rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act if our controlling shareholders sell a substantial amount of our ordinary shares after the expiration of the lockup period the prevailing market price for our ordinary shares could be adversely affected 

upon the consummation of the ipo there were an aggregate of 5761291 outstanding management ncl corporation units which represented a 27 economic interest in nclc in connection with the consummation of the ipo we entered into an exchange agreement with nclc pursuant to the exchange agreement and subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units has the right to cause nclc and us to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for our ordinary shares at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events the exchange right described above is subject to i the filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement by us that in our determination contains all the information which is required to effect a registered sale of our shares and ii all applicable legal and contractual restrictions including those imposed by the lockup agreements entered into in connection with the ipo we have reserved for issuance a number of our ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units following the expiration of the 180day lockup agreements entered into in connection with the ipo we intend to file a registration statement with the sec to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elect to exchange 

we may issue our ordinary shares or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments if any such acquisition or investment is significant the number of ordinary shares or the number or aggregate principal amount as the case may be of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial we may also grant registration rights covering those ordinary shares or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 

we granted approximately 33 million options to acquire our ordinary shares to our management team under our new longterm incentive plan in connection with the ipo we have filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act covering the ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our new longterm incentive plan including the shares subject to the new option grants accordingly 15035106 ordinary shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market upon exercise or other acquisition by the holders subject to vesting restrictions rule 144 limitations applicable to our affiliates and contractual lockup provisions 

we do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares at any time in the foreseeable future 

we do not currently intend to pay dividends to our shareholders and our board of directors may never declare a dividend our debt agreements limit or prohibit and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict among other things the ability of our subsidiaries including nclc to pay distributions to nclh and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders in addition any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends in addition we are a holding company and would depend upon our subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to us to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of nclh investors seeking dividends should not purchase our ordinary shares 

provisions in our constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests 

our byelaws contain provisions that may delay defer prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders consider to be in their best interests as a result these provisions may prevent our shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context even in the absence of a takeover attempt the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future these provisions include subject to the shareholders’ agreement 

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally our byelaws contain provisions that prevent third parties other than the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 49 of its outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors and provide for the lapse of rights and sale of any shares acquired in excess of that limit the effect of these provisions as well as the significant ownership of ordinary shares by our existing shareholders the apollo funds the tpg viking funds and genting hk may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares 

any issuance of preference shares could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our ordinary shares which could depress the price of our ordinary shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue preference shares and to determine the preferences limitations and relative rights of shares of preference shares and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series without any further vote or action by our shareholders subject to the shareholders’ agreement our preference shares could be issued with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our ordinary shares the potential issuance of preference shares may delay or prevent a change in control of us discouraging bids for our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in july 2009 a class action complaint was filed against ncl bahamas ltd in the united states district court southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of crew members alleging inappropriate deductions of their wages pursuant to the seaman’s wage act and wrongful termination resulting in a loss of retirement benefits in december 2010 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in february 2011 the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration as to the court’s order on class certification which was denied the court tried six individual plaintiffs’ claims and in september 2012 awarded wages aggregating approximately 100000 to such plaintiffs the plaintiffs have filed an appeal of the court’s decision in the individual actions as well as the denial of the class certification we intend to vigorously defend this appeal and are not able at this time to estimate the impact of these proceedings 

in may 2011 a class action complaint was filed against ncl bahamas ltd in the united states district court southern district of florida on behalf of a purported class of crew members alleging inappropriate deductions of their wages pursuant to the seaman’s wage act and breach of contract in july 2012 this action was stayed by the court pending the outcome of the litigation commenced with the class action complaint filed in july 2009 we are vigorously defending this action and are not able at this time to estimate the impact of these proceedings 

in the normal course of our business various other claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and accordingly the maximum amount of our liability is typically limited to our deductible amount nonetheless the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits that are not covered by insurance cannot be determined at this time we have evaluated our overall exposure with respect to all of our threatened and pending litigation and to the extent required we have accrued amounts for all estimable probable losses associated with our deemed exposure we are currently unable to estimate any other potential contingent losses beyond those accrued as discovery is not complete nor is adequate information available to estimate such range of loss or potential recovery we intend to vigorously defend our legal position on all claims and to the extent necessary seek recovery

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures such as net revenue net yield net cruise cost and adjusted ebitda to enable us to analyze our performance we utilize net revenue and net yield to manage our business on a daytoday basis and believe that they are the most relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect the revenue earned by us net of significant variable costs and are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure revenue performance in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise cost and net cruise cost excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance and are commonly used in the cruise industry as a measurement of costs 

as our business includes the sourcing of guests and deployment of vessels outside of north america a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies particularly euro and british pound sterling which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency the us dollar in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations we calculate certain nongaap measures on a constant currency basis whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period we believe that presenting these nongaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business 

  

we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance is a factor in the evaluation of the performance of management and is the primary metric used in determining the company’s performance incentive bonus paid to its employees we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining the company’s performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of the company’s business such as sales growth operating costs marketing general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items 

adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or measures comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to items in our consolidated financial statements below in the “results of operations” section 

financial presentation 

revenue from our cruise and cruiserelated activities are categorized by us as “passenger ticket revenue” and “onboard and other revenue” passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to the size of the ship in operation the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises which has historically been strongest during the summer months 

passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations meals in certain restaurants on the ship certain onboard entertainment and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming beverage sales specialty dining shore excursions retail sales and spa services we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires from which we receive a share of their revenue 

our cruise operating expense is classified as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments actual results could differ materially from these estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these critical accounting policies which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements relate to ship accounting asset impairment and contingencies 

ship accounting 

ships represent our most significant assets and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of ships is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred we account for drydock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all drydock costs as incurred 

we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships’ major component systems such as cabins main diesels main electric superstructure and hull in addition we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships given the large and complex nature of our ships our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense if we reduced our estimated average 30year ship service life by one year depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2012 would have increased by 54 million in addition if our ships were estimated to have no residual value depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by 271 million we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships’ costs to the periods that benefit from the ships’ usage 

asset impairment 

we review our longlived assets principally ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates judgments and projections considered necessary the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at discount rates commensurate with the risk involved 

goodwill and other indefinitelived assets principally trade names are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets could not be fully recovered 

we believe our estimates and judgments with respect to our longlived assets principally ships and goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are reasonable nonetheless if there was a material change in assumptions used in the determination of such fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances that influence such assets we could be required to record an impairment charge as of december 31 2012 our annual review supports the carrying value of these assets 

  

contingencies 

periodically we assess potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us or any asserted claims including tax legal andor environmental matters although it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any in accordance with the guidance on accounting for contingencies we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimated provisions or previous disclosures

expense 

total cruise operating expense increased 90 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to an increase in capacity days as described above and higher ship operating expenses the increase in ship operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in fuel expense as a result of a 142 increase in average fuel price to 571 per metric ton in 2011 from 500 per metric ton in 2010 total other operating expense increased slightly compared to 2010 due to an increase in depreciation expense related to norwegian epic which entered service in late june 2010 primarily offset by lower general and administrative expenses as a result of ongoing business improvement initiatives and nonrecurring expenses related to the launch of norwegian epic in 2010

general 

as of december 31 2012 our liquidity was 4701 million consisting of 455 million in cash and cash equivalents and 4246 million available under our 7500 million senior secured revolving credit facility our main ongoing liquidity requirements are to finance working capital capital expenditures and debt service

in addition subsequent to the balance sheet date nclh completed an ipo we refer you to our notes to our consolidated financial statements note 12— “subsequent events” 

future capital commitments 

future capital commitments consist of contracted commitments including ship construction contracts and future expected capital expenditures necessary for operations as of december 31 2012 anticipated capital expenditures were 8510 million 8559 million and 8889 million for each of the years ending december 31 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively of which we have export credit financing in place for the expenditures related to ship construction contracts of 6300 million for 2013 6763 million for 2014 and 6392 million for 2015 based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 

  

in october 2012 we reached an agreement with meyer werft to build a new cruise ship for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2015 with an option to build a second ship with an expected delivery date in spring 2017 currently referred to as “breakaway plus” this new ship will be the largest in our fleet at approximately 163000 gross tons and 4200 berths and will be similar in design and innovation to our norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway which are currently under construction the contract cost of this ship is approximately €6984 million or 9214 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 of which we have export credit financing in place for 80 of the contract price of the ship this facility is repayable in twentyfour equal semiannual installments beginning on the six month anniversary of the delivery date and bears interest at a rate of 298 per annum other material terms and conditions contained in this facility are consistent with those in our breakaway newbuild export credit facilities 

norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway each at approximately 144000 gross tons and 4000 berths are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 respectively the aggregate cost of these two ships is approximately €13 billion or 17 billion based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 in connection with the contracts to build these ships we do not anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellation to occur however if any would occur it could result in among other things the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us subject to certain refund guarantees and potential claims and impairment losses which may materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

capitalized interest for each of the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 221 million and 167 million respectively associated with the construction of norwegian breakaway and norwegian getaway capitalized interest associated with the construction of norwegian epic for the year ended 2010 was 88 million 

contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2012 our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year including interest payments on longterm debt obligations were as follows in thousands 

 

  

       other 

certain of our service providers have required collateral in the normal course of our business including liens on certain of our ships the amount of collateral may change based on certain terms and conditions 

  

as a routine part of our business depending on market conditions exchange rates pricing and our strategy for growth we regularly consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships we may also consider the sale of ships potential acquisitions and strategic alliances if any of these were to occur they may be financed through the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness through cash flows from operations or through the issuance of debt equity or equityrelated securities 

funding sources 

our debt agreements contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity as well as limit our net funded debttocapital ratio maintain certain other ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends our ships and substantially all other property and equipment are pledged as collateral for our debt we believe we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2012 

the impact of changes in world economies and especially the global credit markets has created a challenging environment and may reduce future consumer demand for cruises and adversely affect our counterparty credit risks in the event this environment deteriorates our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we believe our cash on hand expected future operating cash inflows additional available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to issue debt securities or raise additional equity in connection with our recently completed ipo we refer you to our notes to our consolidated financial statements note 12—“subsequent events” will be sufficient to fund operations debt payment requirements capital expenditures and maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements over the next twelvemonth period as a result of the equity infusion from the ipo and the related use of proceeds our leverage was improved and our balance sheet was strengthened there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in the future to fund our future obligations 

item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 

general 

we are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices we attempt to minimize these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivatives the financial impacts of these derivative instruments are primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we achieve this by closely matching the amount term and conditions of the derivatives with the underlying risk being hedged we do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuations and sensitivity analyses 

interest rate risk 

from time to time we consider entering into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense as of december 31 2012 39 of our debt was fixed and 61 was variable based on our december 31 2012 outstanding variable rate debt balance a one percentage point increase in annual libor interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 182 million excluding the effects of capitalization of interest 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as of december 31 2012 we had foreign currency options including call options with deferred premiums and a collar and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates related to our ship construction contracts denominated in euros these derivatives hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk on a portion of the final payments on our ship construction contracts for the call option contracts if the spot rate at the date the ships are delivered is less than the strike price we would pay the deferred premiums and not exercise the options for the collar if the spot rate at the date the ships are delivered is more than the put option strike price and less than the call option strike price neither the put or call option will be exercised as of december 31 2012 the remaining payments not hedged aggregate €10295 million or 13582 million based on the eurous dollar exchange rate as of december 31 2012 we estimate that a 10 change in the euro as of december 31 2012 would result in a 1358 million change in the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated remaining payments 

  

fuel price risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted purchases of fuel on our ships fuel expense as a percentage of our total cruise operating expense was 192 166 and 154 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively from time to time we use fuel derivative agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices as of december 31 2012 we had hedged approximately 69 48 and 10 of our 2013 2014 and 2015 projected metric tons of fuel purchases respectively we estimate that a 10 increase in our weightedaverage fuel price would increase our anticipated 2013 fuel expense by 299 million this increase would be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements and fuel collars and options of 184 million fair value of our derivative contracts is derived using valuation models that utilize the income valuation approach these valuation models take into account the contract terms such as maturity as well as other inputs such as fuel types fuel curves creditworthiness of the counterparty and the company as well as other data points

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

this section describes each of the material elements of compensation awarded to earned by or paid to our executive officers identified in the “2012 summary compensation” table which we refer to in this section as our “named executive officers” or “neos” this section also describes the role and involvement of various parties in our executive compensation analysis and decisions and provides a discussion of the process and rationale for the decisions of our board of directors to compensate our named executive officers with specific types and amounts of compensation the named executive officers for 2012 were 

 

 although following the ipo we now have a separate compensation committee our executive compensation programs have historically been determined and approved by our entire board of directors our board of directors historically had the authority to determine all aspects of our executive compensation program and made all compensation decisions affecting the named executive officers prior to the ipo none of the named executive officers are members of our board of directors or otherwise had any role in determining the compensation of other named executive officers although our board of directors did consider the recommendations of our president and chief executive officer the “ceo” in setting compensation levels for our executive officers other than the ceo following the ipo our compensation committee has the authority to determine all aspects of our executive compensation program and make all compensation decisions affecting the named executive officers and will take over the compensationrelated responsibilities previously performed by the board of directors 

executive compensation program objectives and philosophy 

the company’s executive compensation arrangements are guided by the following principles and business objectives 

 

  

 the company’s executive compensation program is designed according to these principles and is intended to achieve two principal objectives 1 effectively attract and retain executives with the requisite skills and experience to help us achieve our business objectives and develop expand and execute business opportunities that improve longterm shareholder value and 2 encourage executives to achieve our shortterm and longterm business objectives and increase longterm shareholder value by linking executive compensation to company performance increases in longterm shareholder value and individual performance 

  

the company’s current compensation program has three key elements which are designed to be consistent with the company’s compensation philosophy and business objectives 1 base salary 2 annual and mediumterm incentive cash bonuses and 3 longterm equity awards that are subject to both time and performancebased vesting requirements the company also provides nonqualified deferred compensation plan benefits 401k retirement benefits perquisites and severance benefits to the executive officers including the named executive officers 

in structuring executive compensation arrangements our board of directors considers how each component meets these objectives base salaries severance retirement and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits are primarily intended to attract and retain highly qualified executives these are the elements of our executive compensation program where the value of the benefit in any given year is not dependent on performance although base salary amounts and benefits determined by reference to base salary may change from year to year depending on performance among other things we believe that in order to attract and retain top executives we need to provide our executives with compensation levels that reward their continued service and are competitive some of the elements such as base salaries are paid out on a shortterm or current basis other elements such as benefits provided upon termination of employment and nonqualified deferred compensation are paid out on a longer term basis we believe that this mix of short and longterm elements allows us to achieve our goals of attracting and retaining top executives 

annual and mediumterm incentive bonuses and longterm equity incentives are the elements of our executive compensation program that are designed to reward performance and thus the creation of shareholder value annual incentive bonuses are primarily intended to motivate the named executive officers to achieve the company’s annual financial objectives although we also believe they help us attract and retain top executives mediumterm incentive bonuses are used from time to time as an additional performance incentive and are primarily intended to motivate the named executive officers to achieve specific performance objectives our longterm equity incentives are primarily intended to align named executive officers’ longterm interests with shareholders’ longterm interests although we also believe that they play a role in helping us to attract and retain top executives 

our board of directors believes that performancebased compensation such as annual and mediumterm incentive bonuses and longterm equity incentives play a significant role in aligning management’s interests with those of our shareholders for this reason these forms of compensation constitute a significant portion of each of our named executive officers’ compensation opportunity in determining the appropriate mix for each of our named executive officers our board of directors considers and assesses among other factors each named executive officer’s responsibilities background and experience and value to the company as well as each officer’s expected level of contribution toward achieving the company’s longterm objectives 

compensation consultants review of relevant compensation data 

consistent with past practice in 2012 neither our board of directors nor management retained a compensation consultant to review or recommend the amount or form of compensation paid to our executive officers including our named executive officers or our directors if and when we decide to retain a compensation consultant to assist us with our executive compensation programs in the future we will conduct an independence assessment of any such compensation consultant including an assessment of any conflicts of interest as and to the extent required under applicable sec and nasdaq rules 

our board of directors believes that in order to effectively attract and retain high level executive talent each element of the compensation program should establish compensation levels that take into account current market practices our board of directors does not “benchmark” executive compensation at any particular level in comparison with other companies rather our board of directors familiarizes itself with compensation trends and competitive conditions through the review of noncustomized thirdparty market surveys and other publicly available data about relevant market compensation practices in setting compensation levels for 2012 our board of directors considered publicly available compensation data to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of our compensation packages on an aggregate basis solely as a validation after determining the types and amount of compensation based on its own evaluation in addition to a review of the general market compensation levels and practices in setting compensation levels for 2012 our board of directors also relied on its extensive experience managing private equity entities and considered each executive’s level of responsibility and performance for the overall operations of the company historical company practices longterm market trends internal pay equity expectations regarding the individual’s future contributions our own performance budget considerations and succession planning and retention strategies 

  

prior to the ipo there was no public market for nclh’s ordinary shares and as a result we have not been required to hold a shareholder advisory vote on our executive compensation a “say on pay” vote nclh will hold a “say on pay” vote at its first annual shareholders’ meeting and intends to consider the outcome of the “say on pay” vote when making its executive compensation decisions 

executive compensation program elements 

base salaries 

each named executive officer is party to an employment agreement that provides for a fixed base salary subject to annual review by our board of directors the initial base salary level for each named executive officer was negotiated in connection with the executive joining the company or upon a change of their responsibilities decisions regarding adjustments to base salaries are made at the discretion of our board of directors in reviewing base salary levels for our named executive officers our board of directors considers and assesses among other factors each named executive officer’s current base salary their job responsibilities leadership and experience and value to our company in addition as noted above base salary levels are generally intended to be consistent with competitive market base salary levels but are not specifically targeted or “benchmarked” against any particular company or group of companies 

after reviewing the named executive officers’ base salaries in light of the current economic environment and considering the company’s financial position our board of directors determined to increase the base salaries of our named executive officers by 255 from their 2011 levels effective april 1 2012 

annual performance incentives 

each of our named executive officers with the exception of mr becker are eligible for an annual performance incentive cash bonus opportunity pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements the employment agreements for each of these named executive officers provide that for each fiscal year of the company the executive is eligible to earn an incentive bonus determined by our board of directors in its discretion based on the attainment of performance objectives established for the fiscal year by our board of directors for 2012 our board of directors established the applicable performance objectives under the 2012 management incentive plan the 2012 performance objectives were based upon the achievement of certain performance goals of the company and the individual the annual performance incentive is used to ensure that a portion of our named executive officers’ compensation is at risk and that each named executive officer has the opportunity to receive a variable amount of compensation based on our board of directors’ evaluation of our and the individual’s performance mr becker’s employment agreement provides for an annual bonus of 350000 

each year our board of directors establishes the potential value of the executives’ incentive bonus opportunity as well as the performance targets required to achieve these opportunities which may include one or any combination of the following i net income operating income or ebitda ii return on assets return on capital return on equity return on economic capital return on other measures of capital return on sales or other financial criteria iii revenue or net sales iv budget and expense management or v customer or product measures in determining the extent to which the performance measures are met for a given period our board of directors exercises its judgment whether to reflect or exclude the impact of extraordinary unusual or infrequently occurring events 

each year our board of directors also establishes nonfinancial performance measures for our chief executive officer and our chief executive officer establishes the nonfinancial performance measures for each of the other applicable executive officers including the named executive officers these measures are used by our board of directors to evaluate performance beyond purely financial measures and include one or any combination of the following i exceptional performance of each individual’s area of responsibility ii leadership iii creativity and innovation iv collaboration v development and implementation of growth initiatives vi guest experience and loyalty vii employee engagement and viii other activities that are critical to driving longterm value for shareholders 

our board of directors sets the value of the annual performance incentive opportunity as a percentage of the executive’s base salary however the actual amount that becomes payable to an executive is determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion based on the level of achievement of the company performance goal and our board of directors’ assessment of the executive’s individual performance after the end of the year our board of directors reviews the company’s actual performance against the performance goal established at the beginning of the year our board of directors also makes an assessment of performance against the nonfinancial goals set at the outset of the year as well as each named executive officer’s performance in relation to any extraordinary events or transactions 

  

for 2012 our board of directors established a company performance target based on ebitda as defined below for purposes of the management incentive plan with the amount of each named executive officer’s annual performance opportunity to be determined based on the company’s actual ebitda for the year as compared with the target ebitda established by our board of directors if the actual ebitda for 2012 was less than 95 of the target ebitda no bonuses would be paid if the actual ebitda for 2012 was at least 105 of the target ebitda each named executive officer would be eligible to receive up to their maximum bonus opportunity for purposes of our management incentive plan we define ebitda as earnings before interest other income expense including taxes and depreciation and amortization before or after nonrecurring uncontrollable or unusual items our board of directors believes that ebitda is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the company’s business such as sales growth operating costs selling general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense in setting the target ebitda for 2012 our board of directors considered several factors including a careful review of the annual budget and the desire to ensure continued improved performance on a year over year basis our board of directors reserved the right to adjust the goals to take into account changes in deployment of the fleet major unforeseen and uncontrollable events and other nonrecurring and extraordinary costs and revenues experienced by the company during the year and may make appropriate adjustments for certain nonrecurring items consistent with this authority 

the following chart sets forth the ebitda levels at which various levels of incentive payout would become available to our named executive officers for 2012 with the bonus percentage amounts expressed as a percentage of the named executive officer’s base salary for 2012 between these points the payout is calculated on a sliding straight line basis the bonus opportunity set forth in the following chart for each of the named executive officers was determined by our board of directors in its judgment to be appropriate based on the target bonus amount that was negotiated by each executive in their respective employment agreement each executive’s experience and position and general competitive practices 

 

 for 2012 our board of directors established an ebitda goal of 5530 million which the company determined was achieved estimated 2012 bonus amounts for each named executive officer were paid in december of 2012 and on february 18 2013 our compensation committee determined not to increase the amount of any named executive officer’s estimated bonus amount the final bonus amounts are reported in the “2012 summary compensation” table below 

  

driving demand bonus opportunity 

in 2011 the board of directors approved a special onetime incentive opportunity designed to drive demand and pricing each one of our named executive officers was granted an incentive opportunity under the program in 2011 the target bonus opportunity for each named executive officer was determined in 2011 by our board of directors in its judgment to be appropriate based on each executive’s overall responsibilities position in the company and general competitive practices any bonus that becomes payable is based on a percentage of the named executive officer’s base salary as of april 1 2011 and ranges between 25100 of the executive’s base salary at that time 

under the driving demand program each named executive officer is eligible to receive a cash bonus based on performance during a single performance period that covers the 2011 and 2012 years that is based on the company i achieving its ebitda budget for 2011 and 2012 ii improving its net ticket per diem iii improving its guest satisfaction as measured by the company’s guest satisfaction survey results and iv improving its travel agent advocacy as measured by norwegian’s travel agent survey results if the company fails to achieve its ebitda budget for 2011 and 2012 no bonuses will be payable to the named executive officers if the company achieves its ebitda budget the named executive officers’ bonus amounts will be determined based on the achievement of the three other performance factors above although mr becker’s bonus will be determined solely on improvements to our net ticket per diem 

the amount of each named executive officer’s bonus payment under the driving demand program was determined by our compensation committee in the first quarter of 2013 and is reported in the “2012 summary compensation” table below 

longterm equity incentive compensation 

our policy has been that the longterm compensation of our executives including our named executive officers should be directly linked to the value provided to shareholders accordingly our longterm equity incentive program is intended to directly align a significant portion of the compensation of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by motivating and rewarding creation and preservation of longterm shareholder value with measurement to a multiyear performance period 

in 2009 we adopted the profits sharing agreement which authorized us to grant profits interests in the form of ordinary profits units in nclc to certain key employees including the named executive officers each award of ordinary profits units represented a share in any future appreciation of nclc after the date of grant subject to vesting conditions and once certain shareholder returns have been achieved 

on september 4 2012 the board of directors granted mr sheehan certain awards of ordinary profits units in the amounts set forth in the “grants of planbased awards in 2012” table below in determining the level of awards granted to mr sheehan the board of directors took into account his responsibilities background and experience as well as his expected level of contribution toward achieving the company’s longterm objectives and the board’s expectations as to the longterm company performance no ordinary profits units were granted to any of the other named executive officers during 2012 however each of the named executive officers was granted an award of ordinary profits units in prior years and these awards continued to serve as each executive’s longterm compensation opportunity 

the ordinary profits units were generally subject to timebased vesting requirements “tbus” and performancebased vesting requirements “pbus” the tbus were scheduled to vest ratably over five years subject to the executive’s continued employment with the company in general the pbus were scheduled to vest if at all upon a “realization event” which is generally defined to mean any receipt of cash dividends distributions or sale proceeds with respect to our ordinary shares for the apollo funds if the following levels of invested capital are returned to the apollo funds in connection with the realization event 50 of the pbus will vest if the apollo funds receive 100 of their invested capital in the company and the remaining 50 will vest if the apollo funds receive 200 or more of their invested capital in the company these vesting provisions were established to ensure that the value realized by the named executive officers would increase as the final cash return ultimately realized by the apollo funds and our other current shareholders increases 

  

in addition during 2010 mr sheehan was granted 100000 pbus that were scheduled to vest upon the occurrence of a “realization event” provided that the amount of realized cash received by the apollo funds is greater than two and onequarter times 225x the capital invested in the company by the apollo funds this award of pbus was granted to mr sheehan as a special performance incentive to motivate him to achieve a superior cash return for the apollo funds and nclh’s other shareholders 

as part of the corporate reorganization all outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement including the ordinary profits units described above were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of management ncl corporation units the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests will continue to be subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements described above subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units has the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for nclh’s ordinary shares at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events any nonpro rata tax distributions made to a management ncl corporation unit holder will reduce the amount of nclh’s ordinary shares or cash that the holder would otherwise receive upon exchange the exchange right described above is subject to i the filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement by nclh that in its determination contains all the information which is required to effect a registered sale of its shares and ii all applicable legal and contractual restrictions including those imposed by the lockup agreements entered into in connection with the ipo nclh reserved for issuance a number of its ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units following the expiration of the 180day lockup agreements nclh intends to file a registration statement with the sec to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of management ncl corporation units who elect to exchange 

to the extent funds are legally available the tax agreement governing the ncl corporation units provides that nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to the holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holders the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the taxable income determined for us federal income tax purposes allocable to the ncl corporation unit holder multiplied by the us federal and state income tax rate applicable to each holder as determined in the sole discretion of nclh 

we will not grant any additional profits interests under the profits sharing agreement and new longterm incentive awards have been and will be granted under our new longterm incentive plan described under “new longterm incentive plan” below

each of our named executive officers is employed pursuant to an employment agreement that provides for severance benefits upon an involuntary termination of the named executive officer’s employment by us without cause or for mr sheehan a termination by the executive as a result of a constructive termination the severance benefit in each employment agreement was negotiated in connection with the commencement of each executive’s employment with the company or upon a change of their responsibilities in each case our board of directors determined that it was appropriate to provide the executive with severance benefits under the circumstances in light of each of their respective positions with the company general competitive practices and as part of each of their overall compensation package the severance benefits payable to each of our named executive officers upon a qualifying termination of employment generally includes a cash payment based on the executive’s base salary and in some cases including bonus and continued medical benefits for the applicable severance period at the company’s expense 

the company does not believe that the named executive officers should be entitled to any cash severance benefits merely because of a change in control of the company accordingly none of the named executive officers are entitled to any such payments or benefits upon the occurrence of a change in control of the company unless there is an actual or constructive termination of employment following the change in control

compensation risk assessment

grants of planbased awards in 2012 

the following table presents all planbased awards granted to our named executive officers during the year ending december 31 2012 

 

  

    description of planbased awards 

nonequity incentive plan awards 

the material terms of the nonequity incentive plan awards reported in the above table are described in the compensation discussion and analysis section above under the heading “—executive compensation program elements—annual performance incentives” 

equity incentive plan awards 

on september 4 2012 the board of directors granted mr sheehan certain awards of ordinary profits units in the amounts set forth in the “grants of planbased awards in 2012” table above no ordinary profits units were granted to any of the other named executive officers during 2012 however each of the named executive officers was granted an award of ordinary profits units in prior years and these awards continued to serve as each executive’s longterm compensation opportunity each of these awards was granted under and was subject to the terms and conditions of the profits sharing agreement which was adopted by nclc in 2009 

under the profits sharing agreement our board of directors was authorized to grant profits interests in nclc to certain key employees including the named executive officers in the form of ordinary profits units each award of ordinary profits units represented a share in any future appreciation of nclc after the date of grant subject to vesting conditions and once certain shareholder returns have been achieved 

  

generally 50 of the ordinary profits units subject to each award was subject to timebased vesting requirements “tbus” and 50 of the ordinary profits units subject to each award was subject to performancebased vesting requirements “pbus” in addition in 2010 mr sheehan was granted 100000 pbus that were scheduled to vest upon the occurrence of a “realization event” which is generally defined to mean any receipt of cash dividends distributions or sale proceeds with respect to our ordinary shares for the apollo funds provided that the amount of realized cash received by the apollo funds is greater than two and onequarter times 225x the capital invested in the company by the apollo funds 

the tbus generally were scheduled to vest ratably over five years subject to the executive’s continued employment with the company the pbus were scheduled to vest if at all upon a “realization event” for the apollo funds if the following levels of invested capital are returned to the apollo funds in connection with the realization event 50 of the pbus will vest if the apollo funds receive 100 of their invested capital in the company and the remaining 50 will vest if the apollo funds receive 200 or more of their invested capital in the company 

if there is a “sale of the company” as defined in the profits sharing agreement all of the then outstanding unvested tbus after giving effect to any tbus that vest in connection with the transaction would automatically have been forfeited on the date of the sale and any outstanding and unvested pbus would have vested if at all based on the level of the apollo funds’ return on their invested capital as a result of the sale any unvested pbus that did not vest would be forfeited if the named executive officer’s employment terminates the award to the extent it is then unvested would generally have been forfeited except as described in the “potential payments upon termination or change in control” section below 

as part of the corporate reorganization all outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement including the ordinary profits units described above were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of management ncl corporation units the management ncl corporation units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests will continue to be subject to the same timebased vesting requirements and performancebased vesting requirements described above subject to certain procedures and restrictions including the vesting schedules applicable to the management ncl corporation units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions each holder of management ncl corporation units has the right to cause nclc and nclh to exchange the holder’s management ncl corporation units for nclh’s ordinary shares at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every management ncl corporation unit or at nclc’s election a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged management ncl corporation units subject to customary adjustments for stock splits subdivisions combinations and similar extraordinary events any nonpro rata tax distributions made to a management ncl corporation unit holder will reduce the amount of nclh’s ordinary shares or cash that the holder would otherwise receive upon exchange the exchange right described above is subject to i the filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement by nclh that in its determination contains all the information which is required to effect a registered sale of its shares and ii all applicable legal and contractual restrictions including those imposed by the lockup agreements entered into in connection with the ipo nclh has reserved for issuance a number of its ordinary shares corresponding to the number of management ncl corporation units following the expiration of the 180day lockup agreements nclh intends to file a registration statement with the sec to register on a continuous basis the issuance of the ordinary shares to be received by the holders of ncl corporation units who elect to exchange 

to the extent funds are legally available the tax agreement governing the ncl corporation units provides that nclc will make cash distributions which we refer to as “tax distributions” to the holders of the ncl corporation units including the management ncl corporation units if ownership of the ncl corporation units gives rise to us taxable income for the holders the us taxable income attributable to nclh’s ownership of ncl corporation units may be different from the relative us taxable income attributable to the management ncl corporation units in that case tax distributions may be made on a nonpro rata basis with the holders of management ncl corporation units possibly receiving relative tax distributions greater than the tax distributions received by nclh generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the taxable income determined for us federal income tax purposes allocable to the ncl corporation unit holder multiplied by the us federal and state income tax rate applicable to each holder as determined in the sole discretion of nclh 

we will not grant any additional profits interests under the profits sharing agreement and new longterm incentive awards have been and will be granted under nclh’s new longterm incentive plan described under “new longterm incentive plan” below
