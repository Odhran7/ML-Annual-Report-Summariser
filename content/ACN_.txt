we believe that the companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness the five key forces of change we have identified—total enterprise reinvention talent sustainability the metaverse continuum and the ongoing technology revolution we are investing and cocreating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces which we expect to have different time horizons today the strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces we have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving 

• total enterprise reinvention as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology data and ai with new ways of working and engaging with customers employees and partners and new business models products and services we are helping clients build their digital core optimize operations and accelerate growth 

• talent as companies must be able to access great talent be talent creators not just consumers and unlock the potential of their people—from the ways they organize and work to their culture to their employee value proposition 

• sustainability as consumers employees business partners regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action—we believe every business must be a sustainable business 



• the metaverse continuum moving seamlessly between virtual and physical which we believe will provide even greater possibilities in the next waves of digital transformation 

• the ongoing technology revolution from the rich innovation to come in the powerful technologies being used to transform companies today to the new fields of the future from quantum computing to science and space technology 

we believe that helping clients navigate these five key forces of change will in turn drive our growth

our beliefs and behaviors 

our leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people  listening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities and that they experience a positive respectful and inclusive work environment we do this on an ongoing basis across various channels including surveys and forums one of our surveys indicates that 83 of global respondents feel comfortable being themselves at work 



the way we develop and reward our people 

our focus is to create talent and unlock the potential of our people to create strong leaders and to help them achieve their professional and personal aspirations while continuously pivoting to meet new client demands during fiscal 2022 we invested 11 billion in continuous learning and development so our people remain highly relevant with our digital learning platform we delivered over 40 million training hours an increase of 27 compared with fiscal 2021 with an average of approximately 61 hours of training per person we have skills data for our people enabling us to flexibly respond to shifting client needs while also recommending skillspecific training based on an individual’s interests we are also focused on rigorous jobspecific training through key industry certifications and partnerships with leading universities around the globe we also train our people in inclusion and diversity 

we promoted approximately 157000 people in fiscal 2022 demonstrating our continued commitment to creating vibrant careers and opportunities for our people 

we balance our supply of skills with changes in client demand we do this through adjusting levels of new hiring and managing our attrition both voluntary and involuntary we believe people are drawn to our strong purpose values and reputation during fiscal 2022 we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition for fiscal 2022 attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 19 up from 14 in fiscal 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 20 flat with 20 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 in fiscal 2022 we increased our workforce by approximately 100000 people 

accenture’s total rewards consist of cash compensation equity and a wide range of benefits our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people’s skills contributions and career progression base salary bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live certain rewards like equity and bonuses are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company as our people advance in their careers they have greater opportunities to be rewarded accenture’s equitable rewards go beyond financial rewards and include health and wellbeing programs that care for our people

environmental sustainability 

we help our clients—the world’s leading businesses governments and other organizations—together with our ecosystem partners to define measure and achieve their environmental social and governance goals by connecting sustainability with their digital transformation agendas across their strategy and operations to make their value chains more sustainable 

we have a strong commitment to sustainability in the way we operate our business and we hold ourselves accountable to clear and measurable objectives including reaching netzero emissions by 2025 with 100 renewable electricity by 2023 moving towards zerowaste including eliminating ewaste by 2025 and planning for water risk by 2025 

for more than a decade we have continually set challenging environmental goals for ourselves innovating our approach to environmental sustainability and making strategic investments in 2020 we signed the un global compact’s business ambition and joined leading companies in pledging to do our part to keep global warming below 15° celsius in alignment with the paris agreement and the criteria and recommendations of the science based targets initiative 

netzero emissions by 2025 

to meet these commitments we set a goal to achieve netzero emissions by 2025 by first focusing on actual reductions across our scope 1 2 and 3 emissions and then removing any remaining emissions through naturebased carbon removal offsets 

carbon reduction 

the most significant aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our locations as well as travel and purchased goods and services 



carbon removal 

• naturebased carbon removal to offset our remaining emissions we are investing in naturebased carbon removal solutions to directly remove over 13 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere from 2025 to 2041 

in addition to our goal to achieve net zero emissions we have made further environmental commitments to reduce waste and plan for water risk 



moving towards zero waste 

to move towards zero waste we have committed to 

• r euse or recycle 100 of our ewaste such as computers and servers as well as all our office furniture by 2025 during fiscal 2022 we reused or recycled 99 of our ewaste relating to computers and workstations we continue our efforts to reuse or recycle other ewaste such as monitors and servers and 

• e liminate singleuse plastics in our locations during fiscal 2022 we began pivoting to the purchase of durable andor biodegradable reusable items in our office locations around the world 

planning for water risk 

although accenture is not a waterintensive company we minimize our use of water wherever feasible including responsible use reuse management and discharge across our office portfolio we are particularly conscious of our locations in waterstressed areas to plan for water risk we are developing plans to reduce the impact of flooding drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in highrisk areas in addition to developing water resiliency plans we now measure and report water use in these locations 

global delivery capability 

a key differentiator is our global delivery capability powered by one of the world’s largest networks of advanced technology and intelligent operations centers this allows us to bring the right people at the right time to our clients from anywhere in the world—both in physical and virtual working environments—a capability that is particularly crucial as business needs and conditions change rapidly our global approach provides scalable innovation standardized processes methods and tools automation and artificial intelligence industry expertise and specialized capabilities cost advantages foreign language fluency proximity to clients and time zone advantages—to deliver highquality solutions emphasizing quality productivity reduced risk speed to market and predictability our global delivery model supports all parts of our business to provide clients with pricecompetitive services and solutions 

innovation and intellectual property 

we are committed to developing leadingedge ideas and leveraging emerging technologies and we see innovation as a source of competitive advantage we use our investment in rd—on which we spent 11 billion 11 billion and 871 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively—to help clients address new realities in the marketplace and to face the future with confidence 

our innovation experts work with clients across the world to imagine their future build and cocreate innovative business strategies and technology solutions and then scale those solutions to sustain innovation we harness our unique intellectual property to deliver these innovation services 

we leverage patent trade secret and copyright laws as well as contractual arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect the intellectual property in our innovative services and solutions these include our proprietary platforms software reusable knowledge capital and other innovations we also have policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties such as our clients partners vendors and others as of august 31 2022 we had a portfolio of more than 8300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide 

we believe our combination of people assets and capabilities including our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs makes accenture one of the leading strategic innovation partners for our clients we have deep expertise in innovation consulting including strategy culture change and building new business models through to longterm technology innovation which creates the products and markets of the future

competition 

accenture operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace we compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer—but we believe no other company offers the full range of services at scale that accenture does which uniquely positions us in a highly competitive market our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive basis 

our competitors include large multinational it service providers including the services arms of large global technology providers offshore it service providers in lowercost locations particularly in india accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other it services and solutions solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market industry or service area including advertising agency holding companies engineering services providers and technology startups and inhouse it departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm 

we believe accenture competes successfully in the marketplace because

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price risks in this section are grouped in the following categories 1 business risks 2 financial risks 3 operational risks and 4 legal and regulatory risks many risks affect more than one category and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories 

business risks 

our results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets which are increasingly interdependent causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies and resulting in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which negatively affects our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions inflation economic downturns changes in global trade policies global health emergencies and their impact on us our clients and the industries we serve could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented and virtual reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum and edge computing infrastructure and network engineering intelligent connected products digital engineering and manufacturing and robotics solutions as we expand our services and solutions into these new areas we may be exposed to operational legal regulatory ethical technological and other risks specific to such new areas which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions 



technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of cloud and asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected 

in a particular geographic market service or industry group a small number of clients have contributed or may in the future contribute a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market service or industry group and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market service or industry group 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our people with marketleading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is competition for scarce talent with marketleading skills and capabilities in new technologies and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue 

there is a risk that at certain points in time we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our workforce including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand at certain times and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if our utilization rate is too high or too low it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership with critical capabilities if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead 



our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited our ability to expand in our key markets depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected 

we face legal reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client andor accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients ecosystem partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the increasing reliance on and use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services and as more of our employees continue to work remotely the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks has increased such incidents could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients ecosystem partners and vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary business information in the past we have experienced and in the future we may again experience data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ systems and unauthorized acquisition of our data and our clients’ data including inadvertent disclosure misconfiguration of systems phishing ransomware or malware attacks in addition our clients have experienced and may in the future experience breaches of systems and cloudbased services enabled by or provided by us to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our or our clients’ operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future and such incidents have in the past and may in the future have the impacts discussed below 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client accenture or other thirdparty data including personal data and proprietary information and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of things and analytics unauthorized disclosure or use of denial of access to or other incidents involving sensitive or confidential client vendor ecosystem partner or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation or cybersecurity ransomware or malware attacks or other intentional or unintentional acts could damage our reputation and our competitive positioning in the marketplace disrupt our or our clients’ business cause us to lose clients and result in significant financial exposure and legal liability similarly unauthorized access to or through denial of access to or other incidents involving our software and it supply chain or softwareasaservice providers our or our service providers’ information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware malware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks has and could in the future result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations — see risk factor below entitled “our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability” cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” the united kingdom’s gdpr the california consumer privacy act and its successor the california privacy rights act that will go into effect on january 1 2023 as well as various other us federal and state laws governing the protection of privacy health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us various privacy laws impose compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data including the crossborder transfer of data and significant financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue orders to discontinue certain data processing operations civil lawsuits or reputational damage if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client thirdparty or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security incidents cyberattacks and other related incidents 



the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

• large multinational it service providers including the services arms of large global technology providers 

• offshore it service providers in lowercost locations particularly in india 

• accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other it services and solutions 

• solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market industry or service area including advertising agency holding companies engineering services providers and technology startups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products services or delivery models and 

• inhouse it departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm 

some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive pricing or contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers acquisitions or teaming arrangements consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours new services or technologies offered by competitors ecosystem partners or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations the technology companies described above including many of our ecosystem partners are increasingly able to offer services related to their software platform cloud migration and other solutions or are developing software platform cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent or replace them in their entirety these more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients or competitors cybersecurity incidents or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings we may also experience reputational damage from employees advocacy groups regulators investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer or the clients that we serve similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors ecosystem partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers and advocacy groups 

there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or could negatively impact our relationships with ecosystem partners resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 



our environmental social and governance esg commitments and disclosures may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability 

our brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental social and governance esg initiatives including our goals relating to sustainability eg our commitment to achieve netzero emissions by 2025 and inclusion and diversity our disclosures on these matters and any failure or perceived failure to achieve or accurately report on our commitments could harm our reputation and adversely affect our client relationships or our recruitment and retention efforts as well as expose us to potential legal liability in addition positions we take or do not take on social issues may be unpopular with some of our employees our clients or potential clients governments or advocacy groups which may impact our ability to attract or retain employees or the demand for our services we also may choose not to conduct business with potential clients or discontinue or not expand business with existing clients due to these positions 

increasing focus on esg matters has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in the adoption of legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment as well as legal and regulatory requirements requiring climate human rights and supply chainrelated disclosures if new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations in addition our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards may change from time to time or may not meet the expectations of investors or other stakeholders our ability to achieve our esg commitments including our goals relating to sustainability eg our commitment to achieve netzero emissions by 2025 and inclusion and diversity is subject to numerous risks many of which are outside of our control examples of such risks include 1 the availability and cost of low or noncarbonbased energy sources and technologies 2 evolving regulatory requirements affecting esg standards or disclosures 3 the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability diversity and other standards and 4 our ability to recruit develop and retain diverse talent in addition standards for tracking and reporting on esg matters including climate change and human rights related matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve methodologies for reporting esg data may be updated and previously reported esg data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of thirdparty data changing assumptions changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances our processes and controls for reporting esg matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying measuring and reporting esg metrics including esgrelated disclosures that may be required by the sec european and other regulators and such standards may change over time which could result in significant revisions to our current goals reported progress in achieving such goals or ability to achieve such goals in the future 

if we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major ecosystem partners see “business—services” 

the business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons the priorities and objectives of our ecosystem partners may differ from ours they offer services and solutions that compete with some of our services and solutions they may also form closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors 

some of our ecosystem partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to us the decisions we make visàvis an ecosystem partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationships with other members of our ecosystem 

our ecosystem partners may at times be impacted by global events the changing macroeconomic environment and supply chain disruptions as well as rapid increases in demand for their products and services any of which may impact their ability to provide their products and services within our expected timeframes or at anticipated prices in addition our ecosystem partners may also experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions 

we must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology and services we must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies if we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of ecosystem partners we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market 

if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 



financial risks 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreedupon targets or specific service levels 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations  if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

• general economic and political conditions 

• our clients’ desire to reduce their costs 

• the competitive environment in our industry 

• our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs upon which our pricing is sometimes determined including our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over longterm contracts and 

• the procurement practices of clients and their use of thirdparty advisors 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive  the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to take on more risk or price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs including taking actions to reduce certain costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to costeffectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations we may incur increased costs which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable 

moreover many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms any of which could significantly affect our profitability we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable 



we are increasingly entering into contracts for large complex client engagements to transform our clients’ businesses these deals may involve transforming a client’s business transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology while operating portions of their business all in a compressed timeframe the scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner at the anticipated cost and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles including the us generally accepted accounting principles tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic social and political conditions in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations 

the overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations in the us various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered individual countries across the globe and the european union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” a global coalition of member countries proposed a twopillar plan to reform international taxation the oecd proposals aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax there remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and if enacted the extent of their impact the increased focus of the european commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws or in their interpretation or enforcement around the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states 



our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedged exposure 

changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes our most critical accounting estimates are described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “critical accounting policies and estimates” we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

operational risks 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our strategy to continue to grow in our key markets around the world we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 49 countries around the world one aspect of our strategy is to continue to grow in our key markets around the world our strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and strategy our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

health emergencies or pandemics including covid19 acts of terrorist violence political social and civil unrest regional and international war and other hostilities and international responses to these wars and hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts and water scarcity heat waves wildfires and storms occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our ecosystem partners suppliers or clients by 



disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified people these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security incidents involving our facilities or systems or those of our ecosystem partners suppliers or clients could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and people and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace moreover the extent to which covid19 will continue to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict including the emergence and virulence of new variants the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for covid19 globally government business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic and the effect on the macroeconomic environment and on our clients and their supply chains 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability while our delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india and the philippines where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located respectively in addition certain of our clients and markets are primarily supported by individual delivery centers concentrating our delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks including those discussed in this risk factor many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by increasing geopolitical tensions while these events have not materially impacted our ability to deliver services to our clients international conflicts are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future 

we are unable to protect our people facilities and systems and those of our ecosystem partners suppliers and clients against all such events our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur where large numbers of our people are located or simultaneously affect our people in multiple locations around the world we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2022 we had more than 721000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges as our organization grows and evolves it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge or to effectively change the strategy operations or culture of our company in a timely manner it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our people and operations effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals and motivate engage and retain our people particularly given our worldwide operations rate of new hires and the significant percentage of our employees who have the option to work remotely the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us or obtained inappropriately or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets we have increased and may again in the future increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities these acquisitions and other transactions and investments involve challenges and risks such as that we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired results of operations 



furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire and these risks may be magnified by the size and number of transactions we have executed ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges enhancing controls procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities or from an acquisition’s controls related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security environment the number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure including litigation with new or existing clients unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we also periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and people the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients ecosystem partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages fines penalties debarment or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients ecosystem 



partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients or if our services or solutions cause bodily injuries or property damage for example by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients by contributing to the design development andor engineering of client products or by providing various operational technology digital manufacturing and robotics solutions we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational regulatory reputational or other risks specific to these areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in order to remain competitive we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients’ contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so which may expose us to additional risk in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry we may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected moreover as we expand our services and solutions into new areas we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas 

in addition we engage in platform trust and safety services on behalf of clients including content moderation which could have a negative impact on our employees due to the nature of the materials they review we have been subject to media coverage regarding our provision of these services as well as litigation related to the provision of these services which may result in adverse judgments or settlements or government inquiries and investigations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation including esg regulation and reporting requirements anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards employment and labor relations and human rights the rapidly evolving sanctions environment has resulted in new sanctions and trade restrictions which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries and negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our clients ecosystem partners and us for example as a result of the sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of ukraine by russia we were restricted from offering certain of our services to clients in some locations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 



changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients in addition several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating artificial intelligence and nonpersonal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design build and deploy artificial intelligence and handle nonpersonal data for ourselves and our clients 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

• government entities particularly in the united states often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements us government agencies including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract costs including allocated indirect costs for compliance with the cost accounting standards and the federal acquisition regulation these agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts negative findings from existing and future audits investigations or inquiries or failure to comply with applicable it security or supply chain requirements could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contracts for some period of time in addition if the us government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems including our accounting system may result in the us government preventing us from billing at least temporarily a percentage of our costs as a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits investigations and inquiries we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations 

• if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties including those under the civil us false claims act and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities 

• us government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations from time to time we have made disclosures disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest bribery or improper gratuity a violation of the civil us false claims act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension andor debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the us federal level reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil criminal or administrative sanctions including those described above 

• government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients for example government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of its accuracy may adversely affect our reputation 

• terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties 

• government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies while these projects are often planned and executed as multiyear projects government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding andor at their convenience changes in government or political developments including budget deficits shortfalls or uncertainties government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs we may not be able to fully recover our investments 



• political and economic factors such as pending elections the outcome of recent elections changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services andor lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed 

• our ability to work for the us government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the us department of defense that enhances the ability of our us federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the us government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limits the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects accenture 

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors former employees or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties including competitors as well as nonpracticing holders of intellectual property assets and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights furthermore although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated andor misused intellectual property and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation andor infringement from third parties these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software and other intellectual property in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software or intellectual property for any reason including because it is found to 



infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitutes or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or intellectual property effectively or in a timely and costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to our shareholders we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but that have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2022” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2022 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world which has impacted and may continue to impact our business particularly with regard to wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022 we disposed of our business in russia and recorded a nonoperating loss of 96 million we do not have a business in ukraine or belarus

revenues 



1 effective june 1 2022 we revised the reporting of our industry groups for the movement of aerospace  defense from communications media  technology to products prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 

revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 22 in us dollars and 26 in local currency compared to fiscal 2021 during fiscal 2022 revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets industry groups and types of work 

in our consulting business revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 25 in us dollars and 29 in local currency compared to fiscal 2021 consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in europe growth markets and north america our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation including moving to the cloud embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences 

in our outsourcing business which we also refer to as our managed services business revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 19 in us dollars and 22 in local currency compared to fiscal 2021 outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in growth markets europe and north america we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance cloud enablement and managed security services in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations while a significant portion of our revenues are in us dollars the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies including the euro japanese yen and uk pound there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower the us dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2022 resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4 lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our fiscal 2023 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 6 lower than our revenue growth in local currency 



people metrics 



utilization for fiscal 2022 was 91 down from 93 in fiscal 2021 we hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses our workforce the majority of which serves our clients increased to approximately 721000 as of august 31 2022 compared to approximately 624000 as of august 31 2021 the yearoveryear increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as people added in connection with acquisitions 

during fiscal 2022 we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition for fiscal 2022 attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 19 up from 14 in fiscal 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 20 flat with 20 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand 

in addition we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our people compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year given the overall inflationary environment compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years in fiscal 2022 we have improved pricing which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell across our business while we are increasing pricing as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin the impact of these actions did not in fiscal 2022 and may not in the future fully offset the impact of the compensation increases resulting in lower contract profitability 

our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover or offset increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate new employees 

operating expenses 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other payroll costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are nonclientfacing information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs 

gross margin revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2022 was 320 compared with 324 for fiscal 2021 the decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor costs including increased compensation and subcontractor costs partially offset by a decrease in nonpayroll costs 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 168 for fiscal 2022 compared with 173 for fiscal 2021 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 sales and marketing costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues general and administrative costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues 

operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2022 was 152 compared with 151 for fiscal 2021 



other income expense net 

during fiscal 2021 we recorded gains of 271 million and tax expense of 41 million related to our investment in duck creek technologies for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

effective tax rate 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 240 and 228 respectively absent the investment gains and related tax expense our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 231 

diluted earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 1071 for fiscal 2022 including a 015 negative impact from the disposition of our business in russia compared with 916 for fiscal 2021 the 230 million investment gains net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 036 in fiscal 2021 excluding the impact of these gains diluted earnings per share would have been 880 for fiscal 2021 

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see foreign currency risk under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

nongaap financial measures 

we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 excluding the impact of the investment gains as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period 

new bookings 



amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings 

information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties and some without notice only the noncancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” accordingly a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion 

we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services and some nontechnology consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion revenues including estimated fees are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience 

additionally the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including incentive fees many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time 

for additional information see note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs we release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions 

revenues by segmentgeographic market 

our three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets north america europe and growth markets in addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group we also report revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our geographic markets consulting revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets generally operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture canada holdings inc subsidiary see “business—organizational structure” noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 1071 for fiscal 2022 including a 015 negative impact from the disposition of our business in russia compared with 916 for fiscal 2021 the 230 million investment gains net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 036 in fiscal 2021 excluding the impact of these gains diluted earnings per share would have been 880 for fiscal 2021 for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 3 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors 



results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 31 2021 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended august 31 2020 in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 



liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

• facilitate purchases redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends 

• acquire complementary businesses or technologies 

• take advantage of opportunities including more rapid expansion or 

• develop new services and solutions 

as of august 31 2022 cash and cash equivalents were 79 billion compared with 82 billion as of august 31 2021 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

operating activities the 566 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities including receivables from clients and contract assets 

investing activities the 49 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment for additional information see note 6 business combinations and dispositions to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 385 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances for additional information see note 14 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds in addition domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

share purchases and redemptions 

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2023 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice for additional information see note 14 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

as of august 31 2022 we had commitments of 28 billion related to cloud hosting arrangements software subscriptions information technology services and other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation payments under these commitments are estimated to be made as follows

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges the most significant of which are us dollarjapanese yen us dollareuro us dollarindian rupee us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarswiss franc us dollarchinese yuan us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarsingapore dollar are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated income statements additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges the most significant of which are us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso euroindian rupee and uk poundindian rupee typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2022 it was anticipated that approximately 29 million of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 693 million and 469 million as of august 31 2022 and 2021 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2022 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity investment risk 

our nonmarketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments 

our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of august 31 2022 



we record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values 

the carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value

our beliefs and behaviors 

our leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people

• actively innovate —looking across accenture at what we are doing for clients and externally to partners competitors startups clients academia and analysts—to learn respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same 

listening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities and that they experience a positive respectful and inclusive work environment we do this on an ongoing basis across various channels including surveys and forums one of our surveys our conduct counts survey which measures how our people experience our culture shows that 87 of our global respondents believe they can work to their potential because they are in an environment where they are treated with respect and in an appropriate manner 

our commitment to inclusion and diversity unleashes innovation and we believe creates an environment where all of our people have an opportunity to feel they belong advance and thrive in connection with our priorities around inclusion and diversity we set goals share them publicly collect data to continuously improve and hold our leaders accountable we now have more than 275000 women representing 46 of our workforce which is tracking well against our goal of 50 by 2025 and after achieving our goal of 25 women managing directors by the end of fiscal year 2020 we set a new goal of 30 by 2025 we are also making progress against our 2025 race and ethnicity goals in the us the uk and south africa which we announced in 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price risks in this section are grouped in the following categories 1 business risks 2 financial risks 3 operational risks and 4 legal and regulatory risks many risks affect more than one category and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories 

business risks 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business and operations and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted our operations and could in the future materially adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic the emergence and virulence of new variants which may cause and impact the severity of additional outbreaks how quickly and to what extent normal economic activity resumes the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for covid19 globally vaccination against covid19 as a condition of employment as we have required in the us or as a condition of entry to our or our clients’ offices government business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic the impact on our ability to innovate and the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions 

the closures of our and our clients’ offices and restrictions inhibiting our people’s ability to access those offices disrupted our business and operations and may do so again in the future in addition our employees continue to face challenges in their wellbeing given the additional financial family and health burdens that many employees have experienced and could continue to experience because of the pandemic that may negatively impact our people’s mental and physical health engagement and retention 

any of these events could cause contribute to or magnify the other risks and uncertainties enumerated below and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets which are increasingly interdependent causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies and resulting in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which negatively affects our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because 



it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic changes in global trade policies increasing geopolitical tensions and trends such as populism and economic nationalism and their impact on us our clients and the industries we serve could continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum and edge computing infrastructure and network engineering intelligent connected products digital engineering and manufacturing and asaservice solutions as we expand our services and solutions into these new areas we may be exposed to operational legal regulatory ethical technological and other risks specific to such new areas which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions 

technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of cloud and asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation in a particular geographic market service or industry group a small number of clients have contributed or may in the future contribute a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market service or industry group and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market service or industry group 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the 



level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of marketleading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is competition for scarce talent with marketleading skills and capabilities in new technologies and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly soughtafter skills and will likely continue to do so as a result we may be unable to costeffectively hire and retain employees with these marketleading skills which may cause us to incur increased costs or be unable to fulfill client demand for our services and solutions 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership with critical capabilities if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited our ability to expand in our key markets depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally and remotely on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time we may have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand at certain times and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally as demand for our services and solutions has escalated at a high rate to hire and retain people with the skills necessary to meet demand we have and may continue to adjust compensation which puts upward pressure on our costs and may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we face legal reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client andor accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the increasing reliance on and use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services and as more of our employees are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks has increased such incidents could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients alliance partners and 



vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary business information in the past we have experienced and in the future we may again experience data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ systems and unauthorized acquisition of our data and our clients’ data including inadvertent disclosure misconfiguration of systems phishing ransomware or malware attacks for example as previously reported during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we identified irregular activity in one of our environments which included the extraction of proprietary information by a third party some of which was made available to the public by the third party in addition our clients have experienced and may in the future experience breaches of systems and cloudbased services enabled by or provided by us to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our or our clients’ operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future and such incidents have in the past and may in the future have the impacts discussed below 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and proprietary information and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of things and analytics unauthorized disclosure of denial of access to or other incidents involving sensitive or confidential client vendor alliance partner or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation or cybersecurity ransomware or malware attacks or other intentional or unintentional acts could damage our reputation and our competitive positioning in the marketplace disrupt our or our clients’ business cause us to lose clients and result in significant financial exposure and legal liability similarly unauthorized access to or through denial of access to or other incidents involving our software and it supply chain or softwareasaservice providers our or our service providers’ information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware malware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks has and could in the future result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations — see risk factor below entitled “our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability” cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” the united kingdom’s gdpr the california consumer privacy act and its successor the california privacy rights act that will go into effect on january 1 2023 as well as various other us federal and state laws governing the protection of privacy health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us various privacy laws impose compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data including the crossborder transfer of data and significant financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue orders to discontinue certain data processing operations civil lawsuits or reputational damage if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client thirdparty or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security incidents cyberattacks and other related incidents 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

• large multinational it service providers including the services arms of large global technology providers 

• offshore it service providers in lowercost locations particularly in india 

• accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other it services and solutions 

• solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market industry or service area including advertising agencies engineering services providers and technology startups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products services or delivery models and 

• inhouse it departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm 

some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than 



we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers acquisitions or teaming arrangements consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours the technology companies described above including many of our alliance partners are increasingly able to offer services related to their software platform cloud migration and other solutions or are developing software platform cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent these more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients or competitors cybersecurity incidents or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings we may also experience reputational damage from employees advocacy groups regulators investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer or the clients that we serve similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers 

our brand and reputation are also associated with our public commitments to various corporate environmental social and governance esg initiatives including our goals for sustainability and inclusion and diversity our disclosures on these matters and any failure to achieve our commitments could harm our reputation and adversely affect our client relationships or our recruitment and retention efforts in addition positions we take or do not take on social issues may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our clients or potential clients which may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees or clients we also may choose not to conduct business with potential clients or discontinue or not expand business with existing clients due to these positions 

there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements or could negatively impact our relationships with alliance partners resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

if we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners see “business—services” 

the business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors in addition some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to us the decisions we make visàvis an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions 

we must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies if we are unable to maintain our relationships with 



current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market 

if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreedupon targets or specific service levels 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations  if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

• general economic and political conditions 

• our clients’ desire to reduce their costs 

• the competitive environment in our industry 

• our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs upon which our pricing is sometimes determined including our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over longterm contracts and 

• the procurement practices of clients and their use of thirdparty advisors 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive  the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to take on more risk or price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs including taking actions to reduce certain costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to costeffectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations we may incur increased costs which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable moreover many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms any of which could significantly affect our profitability we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on 



assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable we are increasingly entering into contracts for large complex client engagements to transform our clients’ businesses these deals may involve transforming a client’s business transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology while operating portions of their business all in a compressed timeframe the scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles including the us generally accepted accounting principles tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic social and political conditions in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations 

the overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations in the us various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are under active consideration individual countries across the globe and the european union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” a global coalition of member countries proposed a twopillar plan to reform international taxation the proposals aim to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax there remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and if enacted the extent of their impact some of the proposals if enacted could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic environmental or social concerns or other matters 



our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedged exposure 

changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes our most critical accounting estimates are described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “critical accounting policies and estimates” we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

• facilitate purchases redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends  

• acquire complementary businesses or technologies 

• take advantage of opportunities including more rapid expansion

operational risks 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 50 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in our key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and growth strategy including pandemics international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters security or data incidents and the concentration of our global delivery capability in india and the philippines our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

pandemics international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus significantly adversely affect our results of operations health emergencies or pandemics including covid19 acts of terrorist violence political and social unrest regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts wildfires and storms occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security incidents involving our facilities or systems or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

we are unable to protect our people facilities and systems and those of our alliance partners suppliers and clients against all such occurrences our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur where large numbers of our people are located or simultaneously affect our people in multiple locations around the world we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 

our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippines which has and may continue to expose us to operational risks our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability while our delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india and the philippines where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located respectively concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks including those discussed in this risk factor many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by covid19 for example there was a considerable increase in new covid19 cases in india during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and in the philippines during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 our ability to deliver services to our clients was not materially impacted as we initiated business continuity procedures and took actions to support our people and their families however pandemics are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2021 we had more than 624000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges as our organization grows and evolves it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge or to effectively change the strategy operations or culture of our company in a timely manner it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations rate of new hires and the significant percentage of our employees who have the option to work remotely or who have been required to work remotely because of covid19 pandemic related restrictions the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could 



involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us or obtained inappropriately or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets we have increased and may again in the future increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities these acquisitions and other transactions and investments involve challenges and risks such as that we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired results of operations 

furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire and these risks may be magnified by the size and number of transactions we have executed ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges enhancing controls procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities or from an acquisition’s controls related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security environment the number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure including litigation with new or existing clients unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we also periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or 



businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages fines penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients by contributing to the design development andor engineering of client products or by providing various operational technology solutions we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational regulatory reputational or other risks specific to these areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in order to remain competitive we increasingly enter into agreements based on our clients’ contract terms after conducting an assessment of the risk of doing so which may expose us to additional risk in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry we may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected moreover as we expand our services and solutions into new areas we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas 

in addition we engage in platform trust and safety services on behalf of clients including content moderation which could have a negative impact on our employees due to the nature of the materials they review we have been subject to media coverage regarding our provision of these services as well as litigation related to the provision of these services which may result in adverse judgments or settlements or government inquiries and investigations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation including esg initiatives anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards employment and labor relations and human rights the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us 



to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

• government entities particularly in the united states often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements us government agencies including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract costs including allocated indirect costs for compliance with the cost accounting standards and the federal acquisition regulation these agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts negative findings from existing and future audits investigations or inquiries or failure to comply with applicable it security or supply chain requirements could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contracts for some period of time in addition if the us government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems including our accounting system may result in the us government preventing us from billing at least temporarily a percentage of our costs as a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits investigations and inquiries we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations 

• if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties including those under the civil us false claims act and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities 

• us government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud conflict of interest bribery or improper gratuity a violation of the civil us false claims act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension andor debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the us federal level reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil criminal or administrative sanctions 

• government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients for example government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of its accuracy may adversely affect our reputation 



• terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties 

• government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies while these projects are often planned and executed as multiyear projects government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding andor at their convenience changes in government or political developments including budget deficits shortfalls or uncertainties government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs we may not be able to fully recover our investments 

• political and economic factors such as pending elections the outcome of recent elections changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services andor lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed 

• our ability to work for the us government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the us department of defense that enhances the ability of our us federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the us government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limits the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects accenture 

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors former employees or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties including competitors as well as nonpracticing holders of intellectual property assets and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights furthermore although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated andor misused intellectual property and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation andor infringement from third parties these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our 



contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software and other intellectual property in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software or intellectual property for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitutes or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or intellectual property effectively or in a timely and costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to our shareholders we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 



some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but that have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2021” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2021 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar

approximately 2 consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in growth markets and strong growth in north america and europe our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation including moving to the cloud embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences 

in our outsourcing business revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 15 in us dollars and 13 in local currency compared to fiscal 2020 outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in north america and growth markets and strong growth in europe we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance cloud enablement and managed security services in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro japanese yen and uk pound there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower the us dollar weakened against various currencies during fiscal 2021 resulting in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 3 higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our fiscal 2022 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 05 lower than our revenue growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs 

utilization for fiscal 2021 was 93 up from 90 in fiscal 2020 we hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses our workforce the majority of which serves our clients increased to approximately 624000 as of august 31 2021 compared to 506000 as of august 31 2020 the yearoveryear increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as people added in connection with acquisitions for fiscal 2021 attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 14 up from 12 in fiscal 2020 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations was 19 up from 17 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2021 was 324 compared with 315 for fiscal 2020 the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2021 was due to lower nonpayroll costs primarily for travel partially offset by an increase in labor costs including a onetime bonus for all employees below the managing director level in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 173 for fiscal 2021 compared with 168 for fiscal 2020 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points primarily due to higher nonpayroll costs 

operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2021 was 151 compared with 147 for fiscal 2020 



during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recorded gains of 271 million and 332 million and related tax expense of 41 million and 52 million respectively related to our investment in duck creek technologies for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 228 and 235 respectively absent the investment gains and related tax expense our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 231 and 239 respectively 

diluted earnings per share were 916 for fiscal 2021 compared with 789 for fiscal 2020 the 230 million and 280 million gains on an investment net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 036 and 043 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively excluding the impact of these gains diluted earnings per share would have been 880 and 746 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2021 and 2020 as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period 

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings 

new bookings for fiscal 2021 were 593 billion with consulting bookings of 306 billion and outsourcing bookings of 287 billion compared to 496 billion in fiscal 2020 with consulting bookings of 258 billion and outsourcing bookings of 237 billion 

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings 

information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties and some without notice only the noncancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data accordingly a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion 

we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion revenues including estimated fees are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience 

additionally the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including incentive fees many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time 

for additional information see note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs we release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 



as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions 

revenues by segmentgeographic market 

effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets north america europe and growth markets which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to this change our reportable segments were our five industry groups communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources 

in addition to reporting revenues by geographic market we also report revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our geographic markets consulting revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets generally operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors 



results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

revenues by geographic market industry group and type of work are as follows

1 effective september 1 2020 we revised the reporting of our industry groups to include amounts previously reported in other prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 

revenues 

revenues were impacted by a reduction of approximately 1 from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs in fiscal 2021 across all markets the following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

geographic markets 

• north america revenues increased 12 in local currency led by growth in public service software  platforms and banking  capital markets these increases were partially offset by a decline in energy revenue growth was driven by the united states 

• europe revenues increased 8 in local currency led by growth in consumer goods retail  travel services banking  capital markets software  platforms industrial and life sciences revenue growth was driven by the united kingdom italy germany and switzerland 

• growth markets revenues increased 11 in local currency led by growth in banking  capital markets public service and consumer goods retail  travel services revenue growth was driven by japan

general and administrative costs 

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2021 increased 618 million or 22 over fiscal 2020 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 68 from 64 during this period the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher nonpayroll costs

operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows 



amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market the reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2021 had a favorable impact on operating income in addition during fiscal 2021 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher labor costs including a onetime bonus in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 

• north america operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues 

• europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability  

• growth markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues 



other income expense net 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses nonoperating components of pension expense as well as gains and losses associated with our investments during fiscal 2021 other income expense decreased 59 million from fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower gains on investments including lower gains related to our investment in duck creek technologies partially offset by lower foreign currency losses for additional information on investments see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income tax expense 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 228 compared with 235 for fiscal 2020 absent the 271 million and 332 million gains on an investment and related 41 million and 52 million in tax expense our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 would have been 231 and 239 respectively the lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture canada holdings inc subsidiary see “business—organizational structure” noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 916 for fiscal 2021 compared with 789 for fiscal 2020 the 230 million and 280 million gains on an investment net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 036 and 043 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively excluding the impact of these gains diluted earnings per share would have been 880 and 746 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 3 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 31 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended august 31 2019 in item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 



liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

• facilitate purchases redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends 

• acquire complementary businesses or technologies 

• take advantage of opportunities including more rapid expansion or 

• develop new services and solutions 

as of august 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents were 82 billion compared with 84 billion as of august 31 2020 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

operating activities the 760 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities the 2415 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments partially offset by increased proceeds from investments for additional information see note 6 business combinations to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 877 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances for additional information see note 14 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds in addition domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities 

see note 10 borrowings and indebtedness and note 8 leases to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

share purchases and redemptions 

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2022 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by 



other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice for additional information see note 14 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges the most significant of which are us dollarjapanese yen us dollareuro us dollaruk pound and us dollarindian rupee are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated income statements additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges the most significant of which are us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee and euroindian rupee typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2021 it was anticipated that approximately 104 million of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 469 million and 592 million as of august 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2021 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity investment risk 

our nonmarketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments 

our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of august 31 2021 



we record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values 

the carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders social distancing measures and temporary business closures the pandemic and the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in a substantial curtailment of business activities weakened economic conditions significant economic uncertainty and volatility the pandemic is significantly adversely impacting and could in the future materially adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continuation of additional outbreaks how quickly and to what extent normal economic and social activity can resume the timing of the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatments for covid19 government business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic the prolonged effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions the degree to which client demand normalizes in a remote work environment the reprioritization delay or termination of existing client engagements the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions the closures of our and our clients’ offices and restrictions inhibiting our people’s ability to access those offices have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our ability to sell and provide our services and have resulted in and may continue to result in losses of revenue 

in response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures we have enabled most of our employees to work remotely as governments ease their restrictions our employees will likely increase their social interactions including in certain circumstances in our and our clients’ offices which could increase the risk of infection and could result in increased illness among our employees and associated risks including business interruption 

any of these events could cause contribute to or magnify the other risks and uncertainties enumerated below and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve economic and political conditions have become increasingly volatile negative and uncertain due to the coronavirus pandemic among other reasons and have undermined business confidence in our significant markets and other markets which are increasingly interdependent caused our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies and resulted in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which has and may continue to negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest 



themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic changes in global trade policies increasing geopolitical tensions and trends such as populism and economic nationalism elections in our major markets and their impact on us our clients and the industries we serve could continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum and edge computing and asaservice solutions technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation in a particular geographic market service or industry group a small number of clients have contributed or may in the future contribute a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market service or industry group and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market service or industry group 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 



if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of marketleading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with marketleading skills and capabilities in new technologies and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly soughtafter skills and will likely continue to do so as a result we may be unable to costeffectively hire and retain employees with these marketleading skills which may cause us to incur increased costs or be unable to fulfill client demand for our services and solutions 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership with critical capabilities if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand in our key markets depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally and remotely on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer for example we have experienced reduced demand for strategy and consulting services during the covid19 pandemic and have staffed employees from these practices on projects where we are experiencing strong client demand if we are unable to retain our top talent with these skills we may experience difficulty staffing these engagements when demand for these services rebounds if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of covid19 travel restrictions or increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time we may have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in fiscal 2020 we accelerated our usual level of performancerelated involuntary terminations that would have otherwise occurred throughout fiscal 2021 at certain times and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 



we could face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the increasing reliance on and use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services and as more of our employees are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks increases such incidents could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients alliance partners and vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary business information in the past we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ systems and unauthorized acquisition of our data and our clients’ data including inadvertent disclosure misconfiguration of systems phishing attacks and ransomware attacks in addition our clients have experienced and may in the future experience breaches of systems and cloudbased services enabled by or provided by us to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and proprietary information and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of things and analytics unauthorized disclosure of denial of access to or other incidents involving sensitive or confidential client vendor alliance partner or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation cybersecurity or ransomware attacks or other intentional or unintentional acts could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients and result in significant financial exposure and legal liability similarly unauthorized access to or through denial of access to or other incidents involving our or our service providers’ information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations — see risk factor below entitled “our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability” cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act various other us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us the gdpr imposes compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and significant financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue orders to discontinue certain data processing operations private lawsuits or reputational damage if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security incidents cyberattacks and other related incidents 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

• large multinational it service providers including the services arms of large global technology providers 

• offshore it service providers in lowercost locations particularly in india 

• accounting firms that provide consulting and other it services and solutions 

• solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market industry or service area including advertising agencies and technology startups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products services or delivery models and 

• inhouse it departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm 



some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers acquisitions or teaming arrangements consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours over time our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation the technology companies described above including many of our alliance partners are increasingly able to offer services related to their software platform cloud migration and other solutions or are developing software platform cloud migration and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent these more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreedupon targets or specific service levels 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations  if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

• general economic and political conditions 

• our clients’ desire to reduce their costs 

• the competitive environment in our industry 

• our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs upon which our pricing is sometimes determined includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over longterm contracts and 

• the procurement practices of clients and their use of thirdparty advisors 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive  the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs including taking actions to reduce certain costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to costeffectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations we may incur increased costs which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable 



than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable moreover many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms any of which could significantly affect our profitability we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles including the us generally accepted accounting principles tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic and political conditions and tax policies in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations 

the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business in addition the european commission has expanded upon the oecd guidelines with antitax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states among other things the directives require companies to provide increased countrybycountry disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them in connection with the oecd’s base erosion and profit shifting project the oecd has undertaken a new project focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project may impact all multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation additionally the european commission and some foreign jurisdictions have introduced proposals to 



impose a separate tax on specified digital service activity there is significant uncertainty regarding such proposals the increasingly complex global tax environment and any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients competitors cybersecurity incidents or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings we may also experience reputational damage from employees advocacy groups regulators investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer or the clients that we serve similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 50 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in our key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and growth strategy including pandemics international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and security or data incidents the concentration of our global delivery capability in india and the philippines failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

pandemics international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus significantly adversely affect our results of operations health emergencies or pandemics including covid19 acts of terrorist violence political and social unrest regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security incidents involving our facilities or systems or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

we are unable to protect our people facilities and systems and those of our alliance partners suppliers and clients against all such occurrences our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic 



events occur where large numbers of our people are located or simultaneously affect our people in multiple locations around the world we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 

our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability while our delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india and the philippines where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located respectively concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks including those discussed in this risk factor many of which are beyond our control and which may be exacerbated by covid19 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue to expand in our key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards employment and labor relations and human rights the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages fines penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully 



indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational regulatory reputational or other risks specific to these areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry we may commit to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected moreover as we expand our services and solutions into new areas we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas 

in addition we engage in platform trust and safety services on behalf of clients including content moderation which could have a negative impact on our employees due to the nature of the materials they review we have been subject to media coverage regarding our provision of these services as well as litigation related to the provision of these services which may result in adverse judgments or settlements 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

• government entities particularly in the united states often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements us government agencies including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract costs including allocated indirect costs for compliance with the cost accounting standards and the federal acquisition regulation these agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts negative findings from existing and future audits investigations or inquiries or failure to comply with applicable it security requirements could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contracts for some period of time in addition if the us government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems including our accounting system may result in the us government preventing us from billing at least temporarily a percentage of our costs as a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits investigations and inquiries we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations 

• if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties including those under the civil us false claims act and administrative sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities 

• us government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud 



conflict of interest bribery or improper gratuity a violation of the civil us false claims act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension andor debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the us federal level reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil criminal or administrative sanctions 

• government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients for example government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of its accuracy may adversely affect our reputation 

• terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties 

• government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies while these projects are often planned and executed as multiyear projects government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding andor at their convenience changes in government or political developments including budget deficits shortfalls or uncertainties government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs we may not be able to fully recover our investments 

• political and economic factors such as pending elections the outcome of recent elections changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services andor lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed 

• our ability to work for the us government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the us department of defense that enhances the ability of our us federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the us government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limits the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects accenture 

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites 



by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2020 we had approximately 506000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to us or obtained inappropriately or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information including personal data and proprietary information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets which also became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the change was designed to help us better serve our clients and continue to scale our business we may continue to make changes to our operating model as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

if we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners see “business—services” 

the business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors in addition some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to us the decisions we make visàvis an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions 

we must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies if we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market 

if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired results of operations 



furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges enhancing controls procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities or from an acquisition’s controls related to financial reporting disclosure and cyber and information security environment if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure including litigation with new or existing clients unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we also periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors former employees or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 



in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties including competitors as well as nonpracticing holders of intellectual property assets and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights furthermore although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated andor misused intellectual property and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation andor infringement from third parties these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes our most critical accounting estimates are described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “critical accounting policies and estimates” we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

• facilitate purchases redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends  

• acquire complementary businesses or technologies 



• take advantage of opportunities including more rapid expansion 

• develop new services and solutions and respond to competitive pressures and 

• support general working capital purposes 

any additional capital raised through the sale of equity would dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing or refinancing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to our shareholders we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but that have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2020” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2020 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

change in reportable segments 

effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets north america europe and growth markets which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to this change our reportable segments were our five industry groups communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources for additional information see our form 8k filed on january 13 2020 

overview 

the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty this disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business operations and financial results for fiscal 2020 our revenues grew 3 in us dollars and 4 in local currency a decrease compared to the revenue growth experienced in fiscal 2019 revenues for the first half of fiscal 2020 grew 7 in us dollars and 8 in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and during the second half of fiscal 2020 our revenues declined 1 in us dollars and were flat in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 the pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate as described below we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business including the sales and delivery of services to our clients and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we enabled approximately 95 of our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel we continue to develop and implement our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients’ offices where permissible with our people’s safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition 

we experienced reduced demand for our services during the second half of fiscal 2020 as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic particularly in the travel retail energy high tech and industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services we also experienced increased demand in the public service software  platforms and life sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations the adoption of cloud technologies and securityrelated services in this current market the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively 



for further information on the impact to our results for fiscal 2020 please see “summary of results” below for a discussion of risks related to the covid19 pandemic see “our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic” under item 1a “risk factors” 

summary of results 

revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 3 in us dollars and 4 in local currency compared to fiscal 2019 this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs which reduced revenues approximately 1 during fiscal 2020 revenue growth in local currency was strong in growth markets solid in north america and flat in europe we experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in health  public service modest in products communications media  technology and financial services and flat in resources revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during fiscal 2020 the business environment remained competitive and the changes in demand have led to increased pricing pressure particularly for our consulting services we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell 

in our consulting business revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat in us dollars and increased 2 in local currency compared to fiscal 2019 this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs which reduced consulting revenues approximately 2 consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in growth markets and modest growth in north america partially offset by a modest decline in europe our consulting revenue continues to be driven by digital cloud and securityrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

in our outsourcing business revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 6 in us dollars and 7 in local currency compared to fiscal 2019 outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth across all geographic markets we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services and cloud enablement in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro japanese yen and uk pound there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower the us dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2020 resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1 lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our fiscal 2021 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 2 higher than our revenue growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs 

utilization for fiscal 2020 was 90 down from 91 in fiscal 2019 we hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses our headcount the majority of which serve our clients increased to approximately 506000 as of august 31 2020 compared to approximately 492000 as of august 31 2019 the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions attrition excluding involuntary terminations for fiscal 2020 was 12 down from 17 in fiscal 2019 we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 



gross margin revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2020 was 315 compared with 308 for fiscal 2019 the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was due to lower nonpayroll costs primarily for travel partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 168 for fiscal 2020 compared with 162 for fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs 

operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2020 was 147 compared with 146 for fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2020 we recorded gains of 332 million and 52 million in tax expense related to our investment in duck creek technologies for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 235 compared with 225 for fiscal 2019 absent the 332 million gains on an investment and related 52 million in tax expense our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 239 

diluted earnings per share were 789 for fiscal 2020 compared with 736 for fiscal 2019 the 280 million gains on an investment net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 043 in fiscal 2020 excluding the impact of these gains diluted earnings per share would have been 746 for fiscal 2020 

we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2020 as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of this item and our performance in comparison to the prior period 

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs for more information on our hedging programs see note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings 

new bookings for fiscal 2020 were 496 billion with consulting bookings of 258 billion and outsourcing bookings of 237 billion compared to 455 billion in fiscal 2019 with consulting bookings of 247 billion and outsourcing bookings of 208 billion 

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings 

information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties and some without notice only the noncancelable portion of these contracts is included in the performance obligations disclosed in note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data accordingly a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied overtime or at a pointintime and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion 

we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion revenues including estimated fees are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience 

additionally the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including incentive fees many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time 

for additional information see note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed us tax law the tax act lowered the us statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 resulting in a blended us statutory federal income tax rate of 257 for our fiscal year ended august 31 2018 and a us statutory federal income tax rate of 210 for our fiscal year ended august 31 2019 the tax act’s “base erosion and antiabuse tax” provision and regulations issued thereunder adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs we release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items 



no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions 

revenues by segmentgeographic market 

effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets north america europe and growth markets which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to this change our reportable segments were our five industry groups communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources see note 7 goodwill and intangible assets and note 16 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for further details regarding the change in our reportable segments 

in addition to reporting revenues by geographic markets we also report revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our geographic markets consulting revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets generally operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors 



results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets north america europe and growth markets which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to this change our reportable segments were our five operating groups communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources which we now refer to as our industry groups

operating income and operating margin 

operating income for fiscal 2020 increased 209 million or 3 over fiscal 2019 effective march 1 2020 we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets north america europe and growth markets which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to this change our reportable segments were our five industry groups communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources 

operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows 



amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market the reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

• north america operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues 

• europe operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues 

• growth markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability 



other income expense net 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses nonoperating components of pension expense as well as gains and losses associated with our investments during fiscal 2020 other income expense increased 342 million over fiscal 2019 primarily due to gains of 332 million related to our investment in duck creek technologies for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income tax expense 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 235 compared with 225 for fiscal 2019 absent the 332 million gains on an investment and related 52 million in tax expense our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 239 the higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phasedin effects of us tax reform partially offset by higher tax benefits from sharebased payments for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture canada holdings inc subsidiary see “business—organizational structure” noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



operating activities the 1588 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities including higher collections on net client balances receivables from clients contract assets and deferred revenues 

investing activities the 139 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions partially offset by increased proceeds from investments for additional information see note 6 business combinations to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 282 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances for additional information see note 14 shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds in addition domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities 

see note 10 borrowings and indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

share purchases and redemptions 

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2021 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

1 the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined for additional information see note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollareuro us dollarjapanese yen us dollarindian rupee us dollarswiss franc us dollaraustralian dollar us dollaruk pound us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarsingapore dollar—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated income statements additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee euroindian rupee australian dollarindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 9 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2020 it was anticipated that approximately 62 million of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 592 million and 509 million as of august 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2020 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity investment risk 

our nonmarketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments 

our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of august 31 2020 



we record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values 

the carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including as a result of the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union changes in global trade policies trade disputes and trends such as populism and economic nationalism and their impact on us our clients and the industries we serve could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum computing and asaservice solutions technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and 

solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation in a particular operating group business industry or geography a small number of clients have contributed or may in the future contribute a significant portion of the revenues of such operating group business industry or geography and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant operating group business industry andor geography 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of marketleading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with marketleading skills and capabilities in new technologies and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly soughtafter skills and may continue to do so as a result we may be unable to costeffectively hire and retain employees with these marketleading skills which may cause us to incur increased costs or be unable to fulfill client demand for our services and solutions 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership with critical capabilities if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand in our key markets depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed therefore if we are not 

able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients alliance partners and vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data in the past we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ systems which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of things and analytics unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation or other intentional or unintentional acts could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure similarly unauthorized access to or through our or our service providers’ information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations continue to evolve are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us the gdpr imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue orders to discontinue certain data processing operations private lawsuits or reputational damage if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory 

enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours over time our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation the technology companies described above including many of our alliance partners are increasingly able to offer services related to their software platform and other solutions or are developing software platform and other solutions that require integration services to a lesser extent these more integrated services and solutions may represent more attractive alternatives to clients than some of our services and solutions which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles including the us generally accepted accounting principles tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic conditions 

and tax policies in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position 

a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations for example in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed us tax law the tax act’s “base erosion and antiabuse tax” provisions and regulations issued thereunder adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses 

the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business in addition the european commission has expanded upon the oecd guidelines with antitax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states among other things the directives require companies to provide increased countrybycountry disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them in connection with the oecd’s base erosion and profit shifting project the oecd has undertaken a new project focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project may impact all multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation additionally the european commission and some foreign jurisdictions have introduced proposals to impose a separate tax on specified digital service activity there is significant uncertainty regarding such proposals the increasingly complex global tax environment and any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the 

services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs including taking actions to reduce certain costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to costeffectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations we may incur increased costs which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate 

the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 51 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in our key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and growth strategy including the concentration of our global delivery capability in india and the philippines international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and security or data breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks including those listed in the following paragraph many of which are beyond our control our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue to expand in our key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the 

performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages fines penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example by taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses including functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional and evolving operational regulatory reputational or other risks specific to these areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the industry we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas we may be exposed to additional and evolving risks specific to these new areas 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe 

a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 



we bid shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services andor lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2019 we had approximately 492000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients cybersecurity breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings we may also experience reputational damage from employees advocacy groups and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer or the clients that we serve similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

if we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners see “business—alliances” 

the business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors in addition some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to us the decisions we make visàvis an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions 

we must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies if we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market 

if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired results of operations 

furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities internal controls and security environment if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation 

may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we also periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors former employees or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights additionally individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes our most critical accounting estimates are described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “critical accounting policies and estimates” we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

many of our contracts include fees subject to the attainment of targets or specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state 

securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

although the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the irish courts will recognize a us judgment if the following important requirements are satisfied 

• the originating court is a court of competent jurisdiction 

• the judgment is final and conclusive and 

• the judgment was not obtained by fraud and its recognition is not contrary to irish public policy 

any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2019 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2019  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts to renew and extend existing contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions there also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro uk pound and japanese yen unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results 

effective september 1 2018 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 in connection with the adoption we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements net revenues this change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue such as operating margin prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

summary of results 

revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5 in us dollars and 85 in local currency compared to fiscal 2018  demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong resulting in growth across all areas of our business during fiscal 2019  revenue growth in local currency was very strong in resources strong in communications media  technology products and health  public service and modest in financial services we experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in growth markets strong in north america and solid in europe revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during fiscal 2019  while the business environment remained competitive we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell 

in our consulting business revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5 in us dollars and 8 in local currency compared to fiscal 2018  consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in resources strong growth in health  public service products and communications media  technology and modest growth in financial services  our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital cloud and securityrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

in our outsourcing business revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 6 in us dollars and 9 in local currency compared to fiscal 2018  outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in resources communications media  technology and products solid growth in financial services and modest 

growth in health  public service  we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services and cloud enablement in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower the us dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2019  resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 3 lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 1 lower in us dollars than our revenue growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs 

utilization for fiscal 2019 was 91  consistent with fiscal 2018  we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 492000 as of august 31 2019  compared to approximately 459000 as of august 31 2018  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions attrition excluding involuntary terminations for fiscal 2019 was 17  up from 15 in fiscal 2018  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

effective september 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201707 compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to nonoperating expenses prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

gross margin revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2019 was 308  compared with 305 for fiscal 2018  the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower nonpayroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2018  

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 162 for fiscal 2019  compared with 161 for fiscal 2018  for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were flat we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate 

operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 2019 was 146  compared with 144 for fiscal 2018  

effective september 1 2018 we adopted asu no 201616 income taxes topic 740 upon adoption we recorded deferred tax assets of 21 billion and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 225  compared with 274 for fiscal 2018  during fiscal 2018 we recorded a 258 million charge associated with tax law changes absent this charge our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 230  for additional information see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

diluted earnings per share were 736 for fiscal 2019  compared with 634 for fiscal 2018  the impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by 040 in fiscal 2018  excluding the impact of these changes diluted earnings per share would have been 674 for fiscal 2018  

we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018  as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these changes and our financial performance when comparing these periods 

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs for more information on our hedging programs see note 8 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings 

new bookings for fiscal 2019 were 455 billion  with consulting bookings of 247 billion and outsourcing bookings of 208 billion  

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties and some without notice under topic 606 only the noncancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations accordingly a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied overtime or at a pointintime and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion 

we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion revenues including estimated fees are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience 

additionally the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including incentive fees many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time 

for additional information see note 2 revenues to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed us tax law the tax act lowered the us statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 resulting in a blended us statutory federal income tax rate of 257 for our fiscal year ended august 31 2018 and a us statutory federal income tax rate of 210 for our fiscal year ended august 31 2019 the tax act’s “base erosion and antiabuse tax” provision and regulations issued thereunder adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings for additional information see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources in addition to reporting revenues by operating group we also report revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018  



 provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 225  compared with 274 for fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2018  we recorded a 258 million charge associated with tax law changes absent this charge our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 230  the lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and lower expense for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities these decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of fasb asu no 201616 and lower tax benefits from sharebased payments for additional information see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture canada holdings inc subsidiary see “business—organizational structure” noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2019 decreased 88 million  or 57  from fiscal 2018  due to the decrease in the noncontrolling ownership percentage in march 2018 from 4 held by accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc to less than 1 held by only accenture canada holdings inc driven by the accenture holdings plc merger with and into accenture plc for additional information on the merger see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8“financial statements and supplementary data”

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2018 was similar to that disclosed for revenue the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017  



 other income expense net 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses nonoperating components of pension expense as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies during fiscal 2018  other expense increased 40 million over fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses 

pension settlement charge 

we recorded a pension settlement charge of 509793 during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our us pension plan for additional information see note 11 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 274  compared with 213 for fiscal 2017  in fiscal 2018  we recorded a 258 million charge associated with tax law changes absent this charge our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 230  absent the pension settlement charge of 510 million and related tax impact of 198 million the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 230 for additional information see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 decreased 35 million  or 18  from fiscal 2017  primarily due to the accenture holdings plc merger with and into accenture plc on march 13 2018 which decreased the noncontrolling ownership percentage from 4 held by accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc to less than 1 held by only accenture canada holdings inc for additional information on the merger see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8“financial statements and supplementary data” 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 634 for fiscal 2018  compared with 544 for fiscal 2017  the 090 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the tax law changes which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 by 040  the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by 047  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 674 and 591 for fiscal 2018 and 2017  respectively an increase of 083  this increase was due to increases of 082 from higher revenues and operating results and 005 from lower weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by decreases of 002 from lower nonoperating income and 002 from higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 3 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018 and the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these changes and our financial performance when comparing these periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

 as of august 31 2019  cash and cash equivalents were 61 billion  compared with 51 billion as of august 31 2018  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



operating activities the 600 million yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities including an increase in accounts payable partially offset by higher tax disbursements 

investing activities the 506 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments for additional information see note 6 business combinations to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 58 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as an increase in purchases of shares partially offset by an increase in proceeds from share issuances and a decrease in the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries for additional information see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds in addition domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities 

see note 9 borrowings and indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

share purchases and redemptions 

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2020  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors 

may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice for additional information see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements for further discussion of these transactions see note 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarjapanese yen us dollareuro us dollarindian rupee us dollarswiss franc us dollarphilippine peso us dollaraustralian dollar us dollaruk pound and us dollarchinese yuan—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statements additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee euroindian rupee australian dollarindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 8 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2019  it was anticipated that approximately 34 million of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 509 million and 483 million as of august 31 2019 and 2018  respectively  

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2019 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

other market risk 

the privately held companies in which we invest are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of august 31 2019  

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including as a result of the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union the potential for changes in global trade policies and trends such as populism and economic nationalism could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum computing and asaservice solutions technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and 

solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation at any given time in a particular operating group business industry or geography one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant operating group business industry andor geography 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of marketleading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and constantly innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with marketleading skills and capabilities in new technologies and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly soughtafter skills and may continue to do so as a result we may be unable to costeffectively hire and retain employees with these marketleading skills which may cause us to incur increased costs as technology evolves and we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with unique and highly specialized skills 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership with critical capabilities if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand geographically depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed therefore if we are not 

able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients alliance partners and vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data in the past we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers’ systems which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of artificial intelligence the internet of things and analytics unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud misappropriation or other intentional or unintentional acts could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure similarly unauthorized access to or through our or our service providers’ information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us the gdpr imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue orders to discontinue certain data processing operations private lawsuits or reputational damage if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to 

significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours over time our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles including the us generally accepted accounting principles tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic conditions 

and tax policies in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position 

a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations for example in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed us tax law the tax act’s “base erosion and antiabuse tax” provisions or regulations issued thereunder could adversely impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses 

the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business in addition the european commission has expanded upon the oecd guidelines with antitax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states among other things the directives require companies to provide increased countrybycountry disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs including taking actions to reduce certain costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to   costeffectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations we may incur increased costs which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying 

exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 52 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including the concentration of our global delivery capability in india and the philippines international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks including those listed in the following paragraph many of which are beyond our control our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners suppliers or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees 

prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages fines penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe 

a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 



we bid shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services andor lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2018 we had approximately 459000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

if we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners see “business—alliances” 

the business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors in addition some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to accenture the decisions we make visàvis an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions 

we must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies if we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market 

if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients cybersecurity breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

we might not be successful at acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities we may not succeed in completing targeted transactions including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive or achieve desired results of operations 

furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the potential loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities internal controls and security environment if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights even where we obtain intellectual property protection our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors former employees or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights additionally individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on 

historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities 

provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

although the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the irish courts will recognize a us judgment if the following important requirements are satisfied 

• the originating court is a court of competent jurisdiction 

• the judgment is final and conclusive and 

• the judgment was not obtained by fraud and its recognition is not contrary to irish public policy 

any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected

purchases of accenture plc class a ordinary shares 

the following table provides information relating to our purchases of accenture plc class a ordinary shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  for yeartodate information on all of our share purchases redemptions and exchanges and further discussion of our share purchase activity see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—share purchases and redemptions” 



  






 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k   

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2018 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2018  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year   

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar   

overview   

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis   

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions there also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and the uk pound unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results   

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for fiscal 2018  increased 135  in us dollars and 105  in local currency compared to fiscal 2017  demand for our services and solutions continued to be very strong resulting in growth across all areas of our business during fiscal 2018  revenue growth in local currency was very strong in communication media  technology resources and products and strong in financial services and health  public service we experienced very strong growth in growth markets and strong growth in north america and europe revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2018  while the business environment remained competitive pricing was relatively stable we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell 

in our consulting business net revenues for fiscal 2018  increased 15  in us dollars and 12  in local currency compared to fiscal 2017  consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018  was led by very strong growth in communications media  technology resources financial services and products as well as strong growth in health  public service  our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital cloud and securityrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for fiscal 2018  increased 12  in us dollars and 9  in local currency compared to fiscal 2017  outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018  was led by very strong growth in communications media  technology resources and products as well as strong growth in health  public service and modest growth in financial services  we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services and cloud enablement in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower  the us dollar weakened against various currencies during fiscal 2018  resulting in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was 

approximately 3  higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our full fiscal 2019  revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 25  lower than our revenue growth in local currency   

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs   

utilization for fiscal 2018  was 91  flat with fiscal 2017  we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 459000  as of august 31 2018  compared to approximately 425000  as of august 31 2017  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions attrition excluding involuntary terminations for fiscal 2018  was 15  up from 14  in fiscal 2017  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2018  was 314  compared with 317  for fiscal 2017  the decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018  was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017  partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 167  for fiscal 2018  compared with 169  for fiscal 2017  we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20  basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat 

during fiscal 2017  we recorded a 510 million  pension settlement charge and related 198 million   reduction in taxes for the us pension plan termination for additional information see note 10  retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for   fiscal 2018  was 148  compared with 133  for fiscal 2017  the pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150  basis points for fiscal 2017  excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge operating margin for fiscal 2017  would have been flat with fiscal 2018  at 148    

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018  was 274  compared with 213  for fiscal 2017  during fiscal 2018 we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” of 178 million  absent this charge and 81 million  of expense from a nonus tax law change our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 230  absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes  described above our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  would have also been 230  for additional information see note 9  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

diluted earnings per share were 634  for fiscal 2018  compared with 544  for fiscal 2017  the impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by 040  in fiscal 2018  the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes  decreased diluted earnings per share by 047  in fiscal 2017  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 674  and 591  for fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively   

we have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018  and the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017  as well as operating income and operating margin 

excluding the impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017  as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our financial performance when comparing these periods   

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are  affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  as described further in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies on march 13 2018 our subsidiary accenture holdings plc merged with and into accenture plc with accenture plc as the surviving entity as a result all of the assets and liabilities of accenture holdings plc were acquired by accenture plc and accenture holdings plc ceased to exist the merger was internal and administrative in nature 

beginning in fiscal 2019 we are adopting new accounting standards that will affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” topic 606 and asu no 201707 “compensation—retirement benefits” topic 715 in connection with the adoption we will present total revenues and will no longer report revenues before reimbursements also certain components of pension costs will be reclassified from operating expenses to nonoperating expenses in our subsequent periodic reports priorperiod results will be revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation additionally on september 1 2018 we will adopt asu no 201616 “income taxes intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” which will require us to record deferred tax assets of up to 21 billion and incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized for additional information see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

bookings and backlog 

new bookings for fiscal 2018  were 4281 billion  with consulting bookings of 2363 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1918 billion    

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination   

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes   

revenue recognition   

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable   

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities   

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned   

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs   

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred   

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable the selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price we charge when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate deliverables exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable performance of the inprocess deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables   

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed   

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters   

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware software and related services resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware software and related services resales in addition reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes   

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which significantly changed us tax law the tax act lowered the us statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 resulting in a blended us statutory federal income tax rate of 257 for our fiscal year ended august 31 2018 the tax act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses   

due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tax act we had previously recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements in the three months ended february 28 2018 we recognized a provisional tax expense of 136724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new lower rates in the three months ended may 31 2018 we recorded an adjustment of 40927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the tax act while we now consider our analysis of these items under the tax act to be complete we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the election is made   

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate   

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs   

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group   

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions   

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses   

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in accenture canada holdings inc and prior to march 13 2018 accenture holdings plc see “business—organizational structure and history” net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased 48 million or 20 from fiscal 2016 the decrease was due to lower net income of 715 million primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016   

earnings per share   

diluted earnings per share were 544 for fiscal 2017 compared with 645 for fiscal 2016 the 101 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by 047 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by 111 excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 591 and 534 for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively an increase of 057 due to increases of 038 from higher revenues and operating results 009 from a lower effective tax rate 006 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 004 from lower nonoperating expense for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

liquidity and capital resources   

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for shortterm borrowings of up to 10 billion backed by our syndicated loan facility in addition we could raise additional funds through other   public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things   

 as of august 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents were 51 billion  compared with 41 billion  as of august 31 2017    

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table   



operating activities   the 1054 million yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and lower tax disbursements as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities including lower spending on certain compensation payments 

investing activities   cash used in investing activities decreased 984 million  due to lower spending on business acquisitions and investments partially offset by higher spending on property and equipment for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

financing activities   the 149 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries for additional information see note 13  material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds in addition domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities   

see note 8 borrowings and indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

share purchases and redemptions   

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2019  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our  openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions   our ongoing 

capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading   

foreign currency risk   

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties   

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollaruk pound us dollarjapanese yen us dollareuro us dollarindian rupee us dollarswiss franc us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarswedish krona—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee euroindian rupee australian dollarindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2018  it was anticipated that approximately 21 million  of net losses net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months   

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 483 million  and 494 million  as of august 31 2018 and 2017  respectively  

interest rate risk   

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2018  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments   

other market risk   

the privately held companies in which we invest are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as of august 31 2018    

equity price risk   

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of things quantum computing and asaservice solutions technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation at any given time in a particular industry or geography one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry andor geography 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire or retrain retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with skills in new technologies and we may be unable to costeffectively hire new employees with these skills which may cause us to incur increased costs as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand geographically depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be 

performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients alliance partners and vendors and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data in the past we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of analytics unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who continuously develop and deploy viruses ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection which will be replaced by the european union general data protection regulation from 2018 onwards various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours over time our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or 

solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability to the degree we have done in the past our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation realignment of portions of our workforce to lowercost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to recover employee compensation increases through improved pricing automation or the movement of   work to lowercost locations we may not be able to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded 

in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and the expiration of current tax benefits tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic conditions and tax policies in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position 

the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results 

of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 



act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension andor debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the us federal level reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil criminal or administrative sanctions 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities we may not successfully identify suitable investment opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations 

furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations the potential loss of key executives employees customers suppliers vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets operations or businesses furthermore acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities internal controls and security environment if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100 this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

our global delivery capability is concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery capability in india where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described below some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience political instability worker strikes civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully below could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 53 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions sea level rise floods droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as physical infrastructure damage to system failures at cyberattacks on or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection government compliance wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines enforcement actions andor criminal prosecution or sanctions unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliance partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions many of our alliance partners are also large clients and some are suppliers of technology to accenture our performance in delivering client work and decisions that accenture makes in choosing suppliers may negatively impact our alliance relationships if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies processes software and other solutions existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

in addition we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we are unable to implement in a costeffective manner alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

further we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients cybersecurity breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media including social media influencers there is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2017 we had approximately 425000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions 

that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize a us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2017 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2017  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview   

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis   

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions there also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and the uk pound unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results   

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for fiscal 2017  increased 6  in us dollars and 7  in local currency compared to fiscal 2016  demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong resulting in growth across most areas of our business during fiscal 2017  revenue growth in local currency was very strong in products and strong in financial services while there was solid growth in communications media  technology and modest growth in health  public service and resources we experienced very strong growth in growth markets and strong growth in europe while growth in north america moderated revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during fiscal 2017  while the business environment remained competitive pricing was relatively stable we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell 

in our consulting business net revenues for fiscal 2017  increased 5  in us dollars and 6  in local currency compared to fiscal 2016  consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2017  was led by very strong growth in products as well as strong growth in financial services and modest growth in communications media  technology while health  public service and resources had slight declines  our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital cloud and securityrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for fiscal 2017  increased 7  in us dollars and 8  in local currency compared to fiscal 2016  outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2017  was led by very strong growth in products as well as strong growth in health  public service communications media  technology and financial services and solid growth in resources  we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher compared to fiscal 2016  the us dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2017  resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue 

growth that was approximately   1  lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year however when compared to the three months ended august 31 2016 the us dollar weakened against various currencies resulting in minimal currency translation impact during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately 3  higher than our revenue growth in local currency   

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs   

utilization for fiscal 2017  was 91  flat with fiscal 2016  we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 425000  as of august 31 2017  compared to approximately 384000  as of august 31 2016  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions attrition excluding involuntary terminations for fiscal 2017  was 14  flat with fiscal 2016  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2017  was 317  compared with 313  for fiscal 2016  the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017  was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2016  

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 169  for fiscal 2017  compared with 166  for fiscal 2016  we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10  basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues increased 40  basis points principally due to higher technology and facilities costs as well as higher acquisitionrelated costs 

during fiscal 2017  we recorded a 510 million  pension settlement charge and related 198 million   reduction in taxes for the us pension plan termination for additional information see note 10  retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for   fiscal 2017  was 133  compared with 146  for fiscal 2016  the pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150  basis points for fiscal 2017  excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge operating margin for fiscal 2017  would have been 148    

during fiscal 2016  we recorded a 548 million  gain on sale of business and 56 million  in taxes related to the divestiture of our navitaire business as well as a 301 million  gain on sale of business and 48 million  in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our duck creek business for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  was 213  compared with 224  for fiscal 2016  absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes  described above our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  would have been 230  absent the gain on sale of our navitaire and duck creek businesses and related taxes  described above  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  would have been 242  for additional information see note 9  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

diluted earnings per share were 544  for fiscal 2017  compared with 645  for fiscal 2016  the pension settlement charge net of taxes  decreased diluted earnings per share by 047  in fiscal 2017  the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes increased diluted earnings per share by 111  in fiscal 2016  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 591  and 534  for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively   

we have presented operating income operating margin effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2017  pension settlement charge and the fiscal 2016  gain on sale of businesses as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period 

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are  affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the costs associated with our global delivery model by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

bookings and backlog   

new bookings for fiscal 2017  were 374 billion  with consulting bookings of 198 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 176 billion  

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination   

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes   

revenue recognition   

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable   

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities   

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned   

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs   

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or 

incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred   

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable the selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the company to similarly situated customers if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate deliverables exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable performance of the inprocess deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables   

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed   

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters   

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware software and related services resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware software and related services resales in addition reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes   

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate   

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs   

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate during fiscal 2015 the company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its us subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of 247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group   

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include strategy management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions   

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses   

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

operating groups   



 geographic regions   

 operating expenses   

operating expenses for fiscal 2017  increased 2146 million  or 7  over fiscal 2016  and increased as a percentage of revenues to 874  from 862  during this period  operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for   fiscal 2017  increased 2145 million  or 8  over fiscal 2016  and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 867  from 854  during this period 

cost of services   

cost of services for fiscal 2017  increased 1215 million  or 5  over fiscal 2016  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 700  from 705  during this period cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017   increased 1214 million  or 5  over fiscal 2016  and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 683  from 687   during this period gross margin for fiscal 2017  increased to 317  from 313  in fiscal 2016 the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017  was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2016    

sales and marketing   

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017  increased 174 million  or 5  over fiscal 2016  and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 108  from 109  during this period 

general and administrative costs   

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2017  increased 247 million  or 13  over fiscal 2016  and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 61  from 57  during this period the increase as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to higher technology and facilities costs as well as higher acquisitionrelated costs   

pension settlement charge   

we recorded a pension settlement charge of 510 million  during fiscal 2017  as a result of the termination of our us pension plan for additional information see note 10  retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

operating income and operating margin 

operating income for fiscal 2017  decreased 178 million  or 4  from fiscal 2016  the pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150  basis points excluding the effect of this charge operating margin for fiscal 2017  increased 20  basis points compared with fiscal 2016  

  operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows   



   

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017  was similar to that disclosed for net revenue in addition during   fiscal 2017 each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016    

 other income expense net   

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies during fiscal 2017  other expense decreased 31 million  from fiscal 2016  primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses 

gain loss on sale of business es 

we recorded a gain from the navitaire divestiture of 548 million  and a gain from the duck creek partial divestiture of 301 million  during fiscal 2016  for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

provision for income taxes   

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  was 213  compared with 224  for fiscal 2016  absent the pension settlement charge of 510 million and related tax impact of 198 million  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  would have been 230  absent the gain on sale of businesses of 849 million and related tax impact of 104 million  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  would have been 242  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  benefited from the final determination of prioryear us taxes other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of asu no 201609 this was partially offset by a net increase to prioryear nonus tax liabilities primarily related to a final assessment of prioryear taxes in switzerland  the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prioryear us taxes for additional information see note 9  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017  decreased 48 million  or 20  from fiscal 2016  the decrease was due to lower net income of 715 million  primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 544  for fiscal 2017  compared with 645  for fiscal 2016  the 101  decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017  by 047  and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016  by 111  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 591 and 534 for fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively an increase of 057  due to increases of 038  from higher revenues and operating results 009  from a lower effective tax rate 006  from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 004  from lower nonoperating expense for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

sales and marketing expense for   fiscal 2016 increased 75 million or 2 over fiscal 2015 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 109 from 113 in fiscal 2015 the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities

general and administrative costs for   fiscal 2016   increased   83 million   or   5 over   fiscal 2015 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   57   from   58 in fiscal 2015 

pension settlement charge 

we recorded a pension settlement charge of   64 million   during   fiscal 2015   as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our us defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments for additional information see note   10   retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements   under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

operating income and operating margin 

operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 375 million or 8 over fiscal 2015 during fiscal 2015 we recorded a pension settlement charge of 64 million which decreased operating margin by 20 basis points excluding the effect of the fiscal 2015 pension settlement charge operating margin for fiscal 2016 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2015 

 operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows 



   

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during   fiscal 2016   was similar to that disclosed for net revenue in addition during   fiscal 2016 each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity   the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for   fiscal 2016   compared with   fiscal 2015 

 other income expense net 

other income expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies during   fiscal 2016 other expense net increased   25 million   over   fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses including losses incurred on the devaluation of the nigerian naira 

gain loss on sale of businesses 

we recorded a gain from the navitaire divestiture of 548 million and a gain from the duck creek partial divestiture of 301 million during fiscal 2016 for additional information see note 5 business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 224 compared with 258 for fiscal 2015 absent the 849 million gain on sale of businesses and related 104 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 242 absent the 64 million pension settlement charge and related 25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 260 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 benefited from a final determination of us federal taxes for fiscal 2012 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 benefited from a final determination of us federal taxes for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 this was offset by expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2015 when we concluded that certain undistributed earnings of our us subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016 increased 18 million or 8 over fiscal 2015 the increase was due to higher net income of 1076 million primarily driven by the gain on sale of businesses partially offset by a reduction in the accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 645 for fiscal 2016 compared with 476 for fiscal 2015the 169 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by 111 and the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by 006 excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 increased 052 compared with fiscal 2015 due to increases of 034 from higher revenues and operating results 013 from a lower effective tax rate and 008 from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 003 from higher nonoperating expense for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity and capital resources   

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for shortterm borrowings of up to 10 billion backed by our syndicated loan facility in addition we could raise additional funds through other   public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things   

 as of august 31 2017  cash and cash equivalents were 41 billion  compared with 49 billion  as of august 31 2016  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table   



 

amounts in table may not total due to rounding   

operating activities   the yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income in fiscal 2017 after excluding the noncash impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 and the gain on sale of businesses in fiscal 2016 proceeds from divestitures are reflected in investing activities 

investing activities   cash used in investing activities increased 1624 million   yearoveryear due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments in fiscal 2017 additionally in fiscal 2016 spending on business acquisitions and investments was largely offset by proceeds  from the navitaire divestiture and duck creek partial divestiture for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

financing activities   the 71 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by an increase in proceeds from share issuances for additional information see note 13  material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

we believe that our current and longerterm working capital investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities   

see note 8 borrowings and indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

share purchases and redemptions   

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2018  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our  openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions   our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements   

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading   

foreign currency risk   

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties   

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollareuro us dollarindian rupee us dollarjapanese yen us dollaruk pound us dollarswiss franc us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarswedish krona—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso euroindian rupee uk poundindian rupee australian dollarindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources for additional information see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2017  it was anticipated that approximately 112 million  of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months   

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 494 million  and 328 million  as of august 31 2017 and 2016  respectively  

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2017  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments   

other market risk   

the privately held companies in which we invest are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of august 31 2017  

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in north america and europe weak demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of north america and europe an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting 

economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as developments such as artificial intelligence automation blockchain internet of things and asaservice solutions are commercialized technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of asaservice solutions could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technologies such as cloudbased services artificial intelligence and automation and others that may emerge have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future this has caused and may in the future cause clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall 

developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and 

solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected 

we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation at any given time in a particular industry or geography one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry andor geography 

many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand geographically depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations 

placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours over time our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies social media and cloudbased services the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information including personal data 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase including through the use of analytics unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who may develop and deploy viruses or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection which will be replaced by the european union general data protection regulation from 2018 onwards various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions if we are unable to remain competitive if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies 

our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability to the degree we have done in the past our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation realignment of portions of our workforce to lowercost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to recover employee compensation increases through improved pricing automation or the movement of   work to lowercost locations we may not be able to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing audits investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits investigations and tax proceedings and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates challenges to our intercompany transactions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position 

the overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions for example the european commission has been conducting investigations focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development 

which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions furthermore a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations the increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken or the treaty may be amended in such a way that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense in addition congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy or in their interpretation or enforcement in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful additionally some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas including risks related to data security a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 



 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring investing in or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities we may not successfully identify suitable investment opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition investment transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to retention payments equity compensation severance pay early retirement costs intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition investment or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential 

exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business in addition we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we periodically evaluate and have engaged in the disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described below some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience political instability worker strikes civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully below could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions floods and other severe weather conditions health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners 

or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition antimoneylaundering data privacy and protection wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliance partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which 

could lessen related demand for our services and solutions if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally in recent years individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us moreover such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

in addition we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property there is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients cybersecurity breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures compliance violations government investigations or legal proceedings similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners our joint ventures or joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage 

to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2016 we had approximately 384000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur 

incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize a us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 



 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2016 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2016  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview   

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis   

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions there also continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and the uk pound unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results   

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  increased 8  in us dollars and 9  in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  net revenues for fiscal 2016  increased 6  in us dollars and 10  in local currency compared to fiscal 2015  demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong resulting in growth across all areas of our business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 revenue growth in local currency was significant in products and strong in health  public service and financial services communications media  technology revenue growth in local currency was solid while resources was flat revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and solid in outsourcing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  while the business environment remained competitive we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business in fiscal 2016 we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell   

in our consulting business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  increased 11  in us dollars and 13  in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  net consulting revenues for fiscal 2016  increased 10  in us dollars and 15  in local currency compared to fiscal 2015  consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was led by very significant growth in products as well as strong growth in financial services health  public service and communications media  technology while resources had a slight decline  we continue to experience growing demand for digitalrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses compared to fiscal 2015  we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower cost resources in our global delivery network this trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business and we expect this trend to continue 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  increased 4  in us dollars and 6  in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2016  increased 1  in us dollars and 6  in local currency compared to fiscal 2015  outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was driven by very strong growth in health  public service as well as solid growth in products and financial services  we are experiencing growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming 

their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs compared to fiscal 2015  we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher when compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015  the us dollar strengthened against many currencies during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended august 31 2016  resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately   2  and 5  lower respectively than our revenue growth in local currency assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for fiscal 2017 we estimate that our full fiscal 2017 revenue growth in us dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency   

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertisingrelated activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space   

utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was 92  up from 91  in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  and 90   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 384000  as of august 31 2016  compared to approximately 358000  as of august 31 2015  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was 16  up from 15  in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  and 14  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees for the majority of our personnel compensation increases for fiscal 2016 became effective december 1 2015 we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees   

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was 313  compared with 317  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  gross margin for fiscal 2016  was 313  compared with 316  for fiscal 2015  the reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2016  was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015  

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 172  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  compared with 179  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 166  for fiscal 2016  compared with 171  for fiscal 2015  we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40  basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10  basis points 

operating expenses in fiscal 2015  included a pension settlement charge of 64 million  related to lump sum cash payments made from our us defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments for additional information see note 10  retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  was   141  compared with 139  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  operating margin for fiscal 2016  was 146  compared with 143  for fiscal 2015  the pension settlement charge of 64 million  recorded in fiscal 2015  decreased operating 

margin by 20  basis points for fiscal 2015  excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge operating margin for fiscal 2015  would have been 145    

during fiscal 2016  we recorded a 548 million  gain on sale of business and 56 million  in taxes related to the divestiture of our navitaire business as well as a 301 million  gain on sale of business and 48 million  in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our duck creek business for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  was 224  compared with 258  for fiscal 2015  absent the 849 million   gain on sale of businesses and related 104 million  in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  would have been 242  absent the 64 million  pension settlement charge and related 25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  would have been 260  

diluted earnings per share were 645  for fiscal 2016  compared with 476  for fiscal 2015  the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes recorded during fiscal 2016  increased diluted earnings per share by 111  in fiscal 2016  the pension settlement charge net of taxes recorded during fiscal 2015  decreased diluted earnings per share by 006  in fiscal 2015  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share would have been 534  and 482  for fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively   

we have presented operating income operating margin effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2016 gain on sale of businesses and the fiscal 2015 pension settlement charge as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period   

our operating income and diluted earnings per share are  affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the cost of our global delivery network by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

bookings and backlog   

new bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  were 899 billion  with consulting bookings of 481 billion   and outsourcing bookings of 418 billion  new bookings for fiscal 2016  were 3539 billion  with consulting bookings of 1916 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1623 billion  

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations   

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination   

critical accounting policies and estimates   

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes   

revenue recognition   

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable   

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities   

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned   

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs   

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or 

incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred   

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable the selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the company to similarly situated customers if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate deliverables exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable performance of the inprocess deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables   

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed   

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters   

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware software and related services resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware software and related services resales in addition reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions   

income taxes   

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate   

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs   

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate   during fiscal 2015 the company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its us subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of 247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings  for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions   

revenues by segmentoperating group   

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions   

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses   

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2016  was similar to that disclosed for net revenue in addition during fiscal 2016  each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity  the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  exclusive of the pension settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2015    



 other expense net   

other expense net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies during fiscal 2016  other expense net increased 25 million  over fiscal 2015  primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses including losses incurred on the devaluation of the nigerian naira   

gain on sale of business es 

we recorded a gain from the navitaire divestiture of 548 million  and a gain from the duck creek partial divestiture of 301 million  during fiscal 2016  for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016  increased 18 million  or 8  over fiscal 2015  the increase was due to higher net income of 1076 million  primarily driven by the gain on sale of businesses partially offset by a reduction in the accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 645  for fiscal 2016  compared with 476  for fiscal 2015  the 169  increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the gain on sale of businesses net of taxes which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016  by 111  and the impact of the pension settlement charge net of taxes which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015  by 006  excluding these impacts diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016  increased 052  compared with fiscal 2015  due to increases of 034  from higher revenues and operating results 013  from a lower effective tax rate and 008  from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 003  from higher nonoperating expense for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015 decreased 14 million or 6 from fiscal 2014 the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest partially offset by higher net income of 98 million for fiscal 2015 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 476 for fiscal 2015 compared with 452 for fiscal 2014 the 024 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the 64 million pension settlement charge which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by 006 excluding the impact of this charge diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 increased 030 compared with fiscal 2014 due to increases of 022 from higher revenues and operating results 009 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 001 from a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 002 from lower nonoperating income for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources   

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things   

 as of august 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents were 49 billion  compared with 44 billion  as of august 31 2015  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table   



 

amounts in table may not total due to rounding   

operating activities   the yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by revenue growth and higher operating income as well as higher collections on net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues partially offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities including higher spending on certain compensation payments   

investing activities   cash used in investing activities decreased 560 million   yearoveryear as higher spending on business acquisitions investments and property and equipment was more than offset by proceeds of 815 million  from the navitaire divestiture and duck creek partial divestiture for additional information see note 5  business combinations and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

financing activities   the 195 million  increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares and an increase in cash dividends paid for additional information see note 13  material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities   

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future   

borrowing facilities   

as of august 31 2016  we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes   



 

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 169 million  and 167 million  of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2016 and 2015  respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of approximately 27 million  at both august 31 2016  and 2015

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2017  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our  openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions   our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice

offbalance sheet arrangements   

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements for further discussion of these transactions see note  15  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

recently adopted accounting pronouncement   

in august 2016 we  early adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet  we  adopted this asu using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on our august 31 2015  consolidated balance sheets to noncurrent resulting in an increase to noncurrent deferred tax assets of 816 million  and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 22 million  

new accounting pronouncements   

on march 31 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which simplifies the accounting for sharebased payment transactions the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled in addition the asu includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements we will early adopt the standard effective september 1 2016 following adoption the primary impact on our  consolidated financial statements will be the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paidin capital which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income we estimate  this change will reduce our  fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points the actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on our  share price during fiscal 2017 provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively  we are continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and our  preliminary assessments are subject to change 

on march 15 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201607 simplifying the transition to the equity method of accounting which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment the asu will be effective for us beginning september 1 2017 including interim periods in our  fiscal year 2018 we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our  consolidated financial statements 

on february 25 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by longterm leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements the asu will be effective for us beginning september 1 2019 including interim periods in our  fiscal year 2020 and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption we are assessing the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements   

on january 5 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities which amends certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the asu will be effective for us beginning september 1 2018 including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019 we do  not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on  our consolidated financial statements    

on may 28 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 accounting standard codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments the asu will be effective for us  beginning september 1 2018 including interim periods in our  fiscal year 2019 and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption  we   will adopt the guidance on september 1 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method we are  assessing the impact of this asu on our  consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading   

foreign currency risk   

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties   

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollareuro us dollarjapanese yen us dollaruk pound us dollarbrazilian real us dollarswiss franc us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso euroindian rupee uk poundindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our global delivery network for additional information see note 7  derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements  under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2016  it was anticipated that approximately 61 million  of net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months   

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 328 million  and 305 million  as of august 31 2016 and 2015  respectively  

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2016  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments   

other market risk   

the privately held companies in which we invest are often in a startup or development stage which is inherently risky the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies we have minimal exposure on our longterm investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of august 31 2016  

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in north america and europe weak demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of north america and europe an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting 

economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions in addition as new technologies become available such as digitalrelated offerings everything as a service eaas and the internet of things iot which continually change the nature of our business clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies such a slowdown can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation at any given time in a particular industry or geography one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry andor geography many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate or delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively manage our current contracts and client relationships could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand geographically depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our profitability could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as 

needed particularly in emerging markets therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours for example there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers which has resulted in the convergence of products and services over time our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information 

in providing services and solutions to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant litigation monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance which includes cyber insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital analytics mobility iot cloudbased services asaservice solutions security cognitive computing and information technology automation technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of eaas solutions could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated these technologies and others that may emerge could reduce and over time replace some of our current business in addition clients may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate the new technologies our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations 

if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services and solutions our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors including 

 11 

in addition our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business due to factors such as the use of alternative pricing the mix of work and the number of service providers among others for example in client engagements involving our eaas solutions revenue is typically generated on a usage basis which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model 

the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share further if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable our cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale engagements or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging programs which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currencies in which our 

revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to costmanagement to the degree we have done in the past 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation realignment of portions of our workforce to lowercost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability over time we have been successful in managing our general and administrative costs because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lowercost locations or otherwise we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 14 

the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect accenture 

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating businesses entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs retention payments employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees which could negatively affect our profitability we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties in addition we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities if any of these circumstances occurs they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business by their nature joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself particularly when we have a minority position this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions and joint ventures for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

we periodically evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees after reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses such as indemnities or other financial obligations in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described below 

some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience political instability and worker strikes india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries including pakistan military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully below could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in our treatment as an irish company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make including with respect to our intercompany transactions we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable particularly in less developed markets and could become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position for example a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions floods and other severe weather conditions global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities 

are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and protection wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors vendors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors vendors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliance partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require 

us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally in recent years individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us moreover such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

in addition we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property there is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients cybersecurity breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures or compliance violations similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners our joint ventures or joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2015 we had more than 358000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill 

our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in both outsourcing and consulting in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances we might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including bankruptcy and insolvency this could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us in addition in certain geographies and industries some clients have requested longer payment terms which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our cash flows recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies act the companies act differs in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2015 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2015  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions there continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar including the euro and the uk pound unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and we expect will continue to have a material effect on our financial results   

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015   increased   1   in us dollars and   12   in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  net revenues for   fiscal 2015   increased   3  in us dollars and 11   in local currency compared to fiscal 2014  demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong resulting in growth across all areas of our business all of our operating groups experienced quarterly yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 while the business environment remained competitive pricing was relatively stable and we saw improvement in certain areas of our business we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell   

in our consulting business net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015   increased   4   in us dollars and   14   in local currency compared to the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  net consulting revenues for   fiscal 2015   increased   3   in us dollars and   11   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2014  we continue to experience growing demand for digitalrelated services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies in addition clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses compared to fiscal 2014 we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network this trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business and we expect this trend to continue   

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  decreased   1   in us dollars and increased   9   in local currency compared to the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  net outsourcing revenues for   fiscal 2015   increased   4   in us dollars and 11  in local currency compared to   fiscal 2014  we are experiencing growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and operation and maintenance of digitalrelated services in addition clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs compared to fiscal 2014 we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network   

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be lower if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues revenue growth and results of operations in us dollars may be higher when compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014  the us dollar strengthened significantly against many currencies during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended august 31 2015  resulting in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 10  and 75  lower respectively than our revenue growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll costs on outsourcing contracts cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery recruiting and training software development and integration of acquisitions sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities marketing and advertising related activities and certain acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space 

effective september 1 2014 we updated the methodology we use to calculate utilization to include all billable employees’ time spent on chargeable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  was 90  flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2015  this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to more than   358000   as of   august 31 2015  compared to more than   336000   as of   may 31 2015   and more than   305000   as of   august 31 2014  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions primarily those delivered through our global delivery network in lowercost locations as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015   was   14  down from   15   in both the   third quarter of fiscal 2015   and   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees   

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015   was   317  flat with   the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  gross margin for   fiscal 2015   was   316  compared with   323   for   fiscal 2014  the reduction in gross margin for   fiscal 2015   was principally due to higher labor costs increased usage of subcontractors and higher nonpayroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to   fiscal 2014    

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   179   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  flat with   the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   171   for   fiscal 2015  compared with   180   for   fiscal 2014  we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for   fiscal 2015   compared to   fiscal 2014  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 30 basis points    

operating expenses in fiscal 2015 included a noncash pension settlement charge of 64 million related to lump sum cash payments made from our us defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments for additional information see note 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2015   was   139  flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  operating margin for   fiscal 2015   was   143  flat with   fiscal 2014  the pension settlement charge of 64 million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015   decreased operating margin by   20 basis points for   fiscal 2015  excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge operating margin would have been 145 for   fiscal 2015  an increase of 20 basis points compared with   fiscal 2014  

the effective tax rate for   fiscal 2015   was   258  compared with   261   for   fiscal 2014  absent the tax impact of the 64 million pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015  our effective tax rate would have been 260 for fiscal 2015   

diluted earnings per share were   476   for   fiscal 2015  compared with   452   for   fiscal 2014  the pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased diluted earnings per share by 006 in fiscal 2015 excluding the impact of this charge diluted earnings per share would have been 482 for fiscal 2015 

we have also presented operating income operating margin effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the noncash pension settlement charge as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of this charge and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period   

our operating income and earnings per share are affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the cost of our global delivery network by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  were 881 billion  with consulting bookings of 408 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 473 billion  new bookings for fiscal 2015  were 3436 billion  with consulting bookings of 1670 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1766 billion  

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred 

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable the selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the company to similarly situated customers if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a 

deliverable accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate deliverables exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable performance of the inprocess deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware software and related services resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware software and related services resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate during fiscal 2015 the company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its us subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested and recorded a tax liability of 247 million  for withholding taxes payable on this distribution we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax 

audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015  decreased 78 million  or 2  from fiscal 2014  and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 113  from 119  during this period the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities

other expense net 

other expense net for fiscal 2015 increased 29 million over fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses including losses incurred on the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  was 258  compared with 261  for fiscal 2014  absent the tax impact of the 64 million pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  would have been 260 the fiscal 2015 tax rate includes higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities for prior years including a 170 million  benefit related to final settlement of us tax audits for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and benefits related to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings offset by an increase in withholding taxes payable on the distribution of us earnings for additional information see note 9 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015  decreased 14 million  or 6  from fiscal 2014  the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest partially offset by higher net income of 98 million for fiscal 2015 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 476  for fiscal 2015  compared with 452  for fiscal 2014  the 024  increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the 64 million pension settlement charge which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015  by 006  excluding the impact of this charge diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015  increased 030  compared with fiscal 2014  due to increases of 022  from higher revenues and operating results 009  from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 001  from a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 002  from lower nonoperating income for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

during fiscal 2014 the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to fiscal 2013 the commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013 

 provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 261 compared with 181 for fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2013 we recorded reorganization benefits of 274 million which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense in addition during fiscal 2013 we recorded a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 absent these items our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 253 the higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture holdings plc and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014 decreased 38 million or 14 from fiscal 2013 the decrease was due to lower net income of 379 million and a reduction in the accenture holdings ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6 for fiscal 2014 from 7 for fiscal 2013 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 452 for fiscal 2014 compared with 493 for fiscal 2013 the 041 decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of 274 million which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by 038 and the 243 million tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by 034 excluding the impact of these benefits earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased 031 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013 due to increases of 025 from higher revenues and operating results and 012 from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 006 from a higher effective tax rate excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits and reorganization benefits for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

 as of august 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents were 44 billion  compared with 49 billion  as of august 31 2014  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



 

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

operating activities the yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities including lower spending on certain compensation payments and higher collections on net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues 

investing activities the 114 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on property and equipment and business acquisitions 

financing activities the 37 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by decreased purchases of shares for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds domestic cash inflows for our irish parent principally dividend distributions from lowertier subsidiaries have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements and we expect this to continue into the future 

borrowing facilities 

as of august 31 2015  we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 



 

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 167 million  and 170 million  of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2015 and 2014  respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of 27 million  as of both august 31 2015 and 2014

our share purchase activity during fiscal 2015  was as follows 



 

 we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2016  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels 

of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture holdings plc ordinary shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

other share redemptions 

during fiscal 2015  we issued 6240119  accenture plc class a ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of accenture holdings plc ordinary shares or prior to august 26 2015 accenture sca class i common shares pursuant to our registration statement on form s3 the “registration statement” the registration statement allows us at our option to issue freely tradable accenture plc class a ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of accenture holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

new accounting pronouncement 

on may 28 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments the asu will be effective for us beginning september 1 2018 including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019 and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption we are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollareuro us dollarjapanese yen us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarswiss franc us dollarnorwegian krone us dollarbrazilian real and us dollaruk pound—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee euroindian rupee and japanese yenchinese yuan which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our global delivery network for additional information see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2015  it was anticipated that approximately 20 million  of net losses net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 305 million  and 259 million  as of august 31 2015 and 2014  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2015  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in north america and europe weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of north america and europe an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting 

economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions in addition as new technologies become available such as software as a service saas which continually change the nature of our business clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies such a slowdown can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating 

new opportunities from the merger or consolidation at any given time in a particular industry or geography one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues and any decision by such a client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry andor geography many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate or delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our ability to expand geographically depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed particularly in emerging markets therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if 

we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets in these situations we have engaged and may in the future engage in actions to rebalance our resources including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand if we are not successful in these initiatives our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours for example there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers which has resulted in the convergence of products and services over time our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information 

in providing services to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data and we expect these activities to increase as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access 

to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers hackers members of organized crime andor statesponsored organizations who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients current areas of significant change include mobility cloudbased computing digital the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data and saas solutions technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and in the case of saas solutions could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated these technologies and others that may emerge could reduce and over time replace some of our current business in addition clients may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate the new technologies our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations 

if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business due to factors such as the use of alternative pricing the mix of work and the number of service providers among others for example in projects involving our saas solutions revenue is typically generated on a usage basis which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model 

the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share further if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

if we do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do 

not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing projects to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable our cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale projects or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging program which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the us dollar such as the indian rupee could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to costmanagement to the degree we have done in the past 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation realignment of portions of our workforce to lowercost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability over time we have been successful in managing our general and administrative costs because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases 

in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lowercost locations or otherwise we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition as we expand our services and solutions into new areas such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 14 

sanctions which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal 

accounting and financial advisory fees we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business by their nature joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself particularly when we have a minority position this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described above some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience political instability and worker strikes india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries including pakistan military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully above could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

changes in our level of taxes as well as audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in our treatment as an irish company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable particularly in less developed markets and could become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position for example a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union are considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with 

ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions floods and other severe weather conditions global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and protection wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to 

limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliance partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners in addition our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to changes in technology which could lessen related demand for our services if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally in recent years individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us moreover such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

in addition we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property there is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients information technology security breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures or compliance violations similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners our joint ventures or joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in both outsourcing and consulting in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances we might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including bankruptcy and insolvency this could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us in addition in certain geographies and industries some clients have requested longer payment terms which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our cash flows recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2014 we had more than 305000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model 

including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include 

 as a result of any of the above factors or any of the other risks described in this item 1a “risk factors” our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland 

similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2013 of ireland the “companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares including shares that are part of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide all of which may impact our business we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions   

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   were   778 billion  compared with   709 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  an increase of   10   in us dollars and   8   in local currency net revenues for   fiscal 2014   were   3000 billion  compared with   2856 billion   for   fiscal 2013  an increase of   5   in both us dollars and   local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 communications media  technology products health  public service and financial services experienced yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency while resources was flat yearoveryear in local currency revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 clients continue to request a higher volume of outsourcing services place a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and manage the pace and level of spending on existing consulting and outsourcing contracts the business environment remains competitive and in the first half of fiscal 2014 we experienced pricing pressures we use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell   

in our consulting business net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   were   402 billion  compared with   380 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  an increase of   6   in us dollars and   4   in local currency net consulting revenues for   fiscal 2014   were   1574 billion  compared with   1538 billion   for   fiscal 2013  an increase of   2   in us dollars and   3   in local currency clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses we continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies including digital services digital marketing analytics and mobility and cloud computing compared to fiscal 2013 we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network this trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue and we expect this trend to continue   

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   were   376 billion  compared with   328 billion   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  an increase of   15   in us dollars and   13   in local currency net outsourcing revenues for   fiscal 2014   were   1426 billion  compared with   1318 billion   for   fiscal 2013  an increase of   8   in both us dollars and   local currency clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs compared to fiscal 2013 we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network   

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  the us dollar weakened against many currencies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  resulting in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1  higher than our revenue growth in 

local currency when compared to fiscal 2013  there was no aggregate foreign currency translation impact during fiscal 2014  resulting in us dollar revenue growth that was the same as our revenue growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on chargeable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  was approximately 88  flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2014  and within our target range this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 

we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to more than   305000   as of   august 31 2014  compared with approximately   293000   as of   may 31 2014   and approximately   275000   as of   august 31 2013  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services primarily those delivered through our global delivery network in lowercost locations as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   was   15  up from   14   in the   third quarter of fiscal 2014   and   12   in the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future for the majority of our personnel compensation increases for fiscal 2014 became effective september 1 2013 we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing and emerging technology services recover increases in compensation deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees   

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   was   317  compared with   332   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  gross margin for   fiscal 2014   was   323  compared with   329   for   fiscal 2013  there were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during   fiscal 2014  we experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases andor rebalance the mix of resources in addition we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts while we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014 the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above   

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   179   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  compared with   193   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   180   for   fiscal 2014  compared with   186   for   fiscal 2013  sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities investment in offerings marketingand advertisingrelated activities and acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for   fiscal 2014   compared to   fiscal 2013  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs each decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of net revenues     

operating income for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   was   1079 million  compared with   984 million   for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  operating income for   fiscal 2014   was   4301 million  compared with   4339 million   for   fiscal 2013  operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2014   was   139  flat with the   fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  operating margin for   fiscal 2014   was   143  compared with   152   for   fiscal 2013  we recorded reorganization benefits of   274 million   during   fiscal 2013   which increased operating margin by   100   basis points excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits operating margin for fiscal 2013 would have been   142  

the effective tax rate for   fiscal 2014   was   261  compared with   181   for   fiscal 2013  the above noted reorganization benefits recorded during fiscal 2013 increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense in addition during fiscal 2013 we recorded a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 absent these items our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2013   would have been   253  

diluted earnings per share were   452   for   fiscal 2014  compared with   493   for   fiscal 2013  which included 072 in benefits from final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities and reductions in reorganization liabilities excluding these benefits diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2013 would have been 421 

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the cost of our global delivery network by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 8 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  were 833 billion  with consulting bookings of 395 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 438 billion  new bookings for fiscal 2014  were 3588 billion  with consulting bookings of 1715 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1873 billion  

we provide information regarding our new bookings which include new contracts including those acquired through acquisitions as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts the types of services clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues for example outsourcing bookings which are typically for multiyear contracts generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time new bookings involve estimates and judgments there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred 

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element the selling price of each element is determined by obtaining third party evidence of fair value of each element and is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered 

element accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware software and related services resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware software and related services resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities 

and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and the outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

 geographic regions 

 in fiscal 2015 we will begin reporting our geographic regions as follows north america the united states and canada europe and growth markets asia pacific latin america africa the middle east russia and turkey see item 9b “other information” for fiscal 2014 and 2013 net revenues aligned with these revised geographic regions 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for fiscal 2014  were 27574 million  an increase of 1519 million  or 6  over fiscal 2013  and increased as a percentage of revenues to 865  from 857  during this period operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014  were 25702 million  an increase of 1478 million  or 6  over fiscal 2013  and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 857  from 848  during this period operating expenses for fiscal 2013  included reorganization benefits of 274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 

cost of services 

cost of services for fiscal 2014  was 22190 million  an increase of 1180 million  or 6  over fiscal 2013  and increased as a percentage of revenues to 696  from 691  during this period cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014  was 20318 million  an increase of 1139 million  or 6  over fiscal 2013  and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 677  from 671  during this period gross margin for fiscal 2014  decreased to 323  from 329  during this period there were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014 we experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases andor rebalance the mix of resources in addition we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts while we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014 the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014  was 3583 million  an increase of 101 million  or 3  over fiscal 2013  and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 119  from 122  during this period

during   fiscal 2014  the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to   fiscal 2013  the commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013   

 provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  was 261  compared with 181  for fiscal 2013  during fiscal 2013  we recorded reorganization benefits of 274 million  which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense in addition during fiscal 2013 we recorded a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 absent these items our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  would have been 253  the higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014  was 234 million  a decrease of 38 million  or 14  from fiscal 2013  the decrease was due to lower net income of 379 million  and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6  for fiscal 2014  from 7  for fiscal 2013  

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 452  for fiscal 2014  compared with 493  for fiscal 2013  the 041  decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of 274 million  which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013  by 038  and the 243 million  tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013  by 034  excluding the impact of these benefits earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased 031  compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013  due to increases of 025  from higher revenues and operating results and 012  from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 006  from a higher effective tax rate excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits and reorganization benefits for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 was 3482 million an increase of 178 million or 5 over fiscal 2012 and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 122 from 119 during this period the increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities as well as acquisitionrelated costs

during fiscal 2013 each operating group recorded a portion of the 274 million reorganization benefits the commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2013 exclusive of the reorganization benefits compared with fiscal 2012 see “reorganization benefits costs net” 

 interest income 

interest income for fiscal 2013 was 33 million a decrease of 10 million or 23 from fiscal 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances 

other expense income net 

other expense income net for fiscal 2013 was 18 million a decrease of 23 million from fiscal 2012 the change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2013 compared to net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 181 compared with 276 for fiscal 2012 during fiscal 2013 we recorded reorganization benefits of 274 million which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense the effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013 absent these items the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 253 which is lower than fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2013 was 273 million an increase of 1 million over fiscal 2012 the increase was due to higher net income of 730 million offset by a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 7 for fiscal 2013 from 9 for fiscal 2012 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 493 for fiscal 2013 compared with 384 for fiscal 2012 the 109 increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of 274 million which increased earnings per share by 038 and the 243 million tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits which increased earnings per share by 034 excluding the impact of these benefits earnings per share increased 037 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2012 due to increases of 019 from higher revenues and operating results 013 from a lower effective tax rate excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits and reorganization benefits and 008 from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 003 from lower nonoperating income for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

 as of august 31 2014  cash and cash equivalents was 49 billion  compared with 56 billion  as of august 31 2013  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



 

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

operating activities the yearoveryear improvement in operating cash flow was primarily due to a discretionary cash contribution of 500 million made to our us defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2013 which had a net impact of 350 million after tax this increase was partially offset by lower collections on net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues and higher current year operational spending 

investing activities the 100 million  decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment for additional information see note 6 business combinations to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 100 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances for additional information see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities 

as of august 31 2014  we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 



 

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 170 million  and 179 million  of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2014 and 2013  respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of 27 million  and 26 million  as of august 31 2014 and 2013  respectively

 43 

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2015  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

other share redemptions 

during fiscal 2014  we issued 1242209  accenture plc class a ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of accenture sca class i common shares pursuant to our registration statement on form s3 the “registration statement” the registration statement allows us at our option to issue freely tradable accenture plc class a ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares held by current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees 

subsequent development 

on september 23 2014  the board of directors of accenture plc declared a semiannual cash dividend of 102  per share on our class a ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 17 2014  accenture plc will cause accenture sca to declare a semiannual cash dividend of 102  per share on its class i common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 14 2014  both dividends are payable on november 17 2014  

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2014  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

amounts in table may not total due to rounding 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project in addition our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

in september 2013 we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” which requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the consolidated balance sheets or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements the guidance also requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset amounts of offset and the related net exposure the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to master netting arrangements see note 8 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

new accounting pronouncement 

on may 28 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments the asu will be effective for us beginning september 1 2017 including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018 and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption we are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollareuro us dollarjapanese yen us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarbrazilian real us dollarsingapore dollar us dollaruk pound and us dollarswiss franc—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee and euroindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our global delivery network for additional information see note 8 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2014  it was anticipated that 20 million  of the net losses net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 259 million  and 309 million  as of august 31 2014 and 2013  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2014  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies or may result in clients reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services for example revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due in large part to lower than expected demand particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions such as certain countries in europe and in brazil a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in europe and north america weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition an economic slowdown in key emerging markets where we typically grow faster than in more mature markets also 

could adversely affect our results of operations as we experienced ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting this could result for example in us having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance 

economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions in addition as new technologies become available such as software as a service saas which continually change the nature of our business clients may slow spending on legacy technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new services and solutions if as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve our clients demand new services and solutions we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract many of our contracts allow clients to terminate or delay reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected   

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our ability to perform our 

work profitably could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed particularly in emerging markets therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies in these situations we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours for example there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers which has resulted in the convergence of products and services over time our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information 

in providing services to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients current areas of significant change include mobility cloudbased computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients these technologies and others that may emerge could reduce and over time replace some of our legacy business in addition we have seen some clients delaying spending under existing contracts and engagements and entering into new contracts more slowly while they evaluate the new technologies our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters volcanic eruptions floods and other severe weather conditions global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and protection wageandhour standards and employment and labor relations the global nature of our operations including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries further increase the difficulty of compliance compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors agents alliance or joint venture partners the companies we acquire and their employees subcontractors and agents and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described above some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience political instability and worker strikes india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries including pakistan military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully above could significantly 

disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations 

if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business due to factors such as the mix of work and the number of service providers among others 

the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share further if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

if our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable 

our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions which is based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing projects to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability in addition contracts used to deliver services and solutions for new technologies might necessitate the use of alternative pricing models which could negatively impact our profitability for example in projects involving our saas solutions revenue is typically generated on a usage basis which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model 

similarly if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale projects or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 17 

us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect accenture 

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation regardless of the merits of the claims the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant and such matters can be timeconsuming and divert management’s attention and resources the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation even if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future 

for example we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging program which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources conversely a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the us dollar such as the indian rupee could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks 

related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change which could adversely affect our results of operations   

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliances partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

outsourcing services and the continued expansion of our other services and solutions into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services 

outsourcing services which represented approximately 46 of our net revenues in fiscal 2013 present different operational risks when compared to our consulting and systems integration services our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our clients’ businesses expose us to claims and harm our reputation and our business 

we have continued to expand our services and solutions into new business areas and provide services to new types of clients and we expect to continue to do so in the future expanding into new areas and providing services to new types of clients may expose us to additional operational regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas we could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients 

we may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements there is a risk that we could face legal liability many of our clients request that we obtain a service organization control soc 1 type 2 audit prepared under statement on standards for attestation engagements no 16 and international standard on assurance engagements 3402 formerly referred to as sas 70 if we receive a qualified opinion or do not deliver the audit reports timely our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly damage our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally in recent years individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us moreover such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

in addition we rely on thirdparty software in providing some of our services and solutions if we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason including because it is found to infringe the rights of others we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions our inability to replace such software or to replace such software in a timely or costeffective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent trade secret copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property there is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients information technology security breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies delivery failures or compliance violations similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners our joint ventures or joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings legislators or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult expensive and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal accounting and financial advisory fees we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business by their nature joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself particularly when we have a minority position this lesser degree 

of control may expose us to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risks litigation indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses for example we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments alternatively shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to costmanagement to the degree we have done in the past 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation realignment of portions of our nonclientfacing workforce to lowercost locations these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability over time we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lowercost locations or otherwise our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in both outsourcing and consulting in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

changes in our level of taxes and audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in our treatment as an irish company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable particularly in less developed markets and could become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2013 we had approximately 275000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information furthermore the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change and if we do not successfully implement the changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances we might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including bankruptcy and insolvency this could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us in addition in certain geographies and industries some clients have requested extended payment terms more frequently and if this trend continues our cash flows could be adversely affected recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include 

 22 

 as a result of any of the above factors or any of the other risks described in this item 1a “risk factors” our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and our accompanying disclosure with respect to among other things revenue recognition and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if our estimates or the assumptions underlying such estimates are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction the 

judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland 

similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2012 of ireland the “companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2013 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2013  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions credit market conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in markets around the world as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide in many of the industries we serve all of which are impacting and we expect will continue to impact our business these conditions have impacted the types of services our clients are demanding clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and are placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and in some cases slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts these changing demand patterns are currently having an adverse impact on the timing of revenue and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  were 709 billion  compared with 684 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  an increase of 37  in us dollars and 45  in local currency net revenues for fiscal 2013  were 2856 billion  compared with 2786 billion  for fiscal 2012  an increase of 3  in us dollars and 4  in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 health  public service products financial services and communications media  technology experienced yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency while resources was flat in local currency yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency was solid in outsourcing while consulting revenues reflected modest growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due in large part to lower than expected demand particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions such as certain countries in europe and in brazil we expect yearoveryear revenues to range from a slight decline to a modest increase in the near term and continue to vary across operating groups and geographic regions with growth in certain areas of our business partially offset by lower growth or declines in other areas 

in our consulting business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  were 380 billion  compared with 374 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  an increase of 2  in us dollars and 3  in local currency net consulting revenues for fiscal 2013  were 1538 billion  compared with 1556 billion  for fiscal 2012  a decrease of 1  in us dollars and an increase of 1  in local currency three of our five operating groups including health  public service communications media  technology and products experienced quarterly yearoveryear consulting revenue growth in local currency while resources and financial services experienced declines in quarterly yearoveryear consulting revenue we continued to enter into a higher proportion of contracts with longer duration that are converting to revenue at a slower pace and clients slowed the pace and level of their spending we expect these trends to continue in the near term clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses we continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies including analytics cloud computing and mobility compared to fiscal 2012 we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network and we expect this trend to continue the business environment is more competitive and in some areas we are experiencing pricing pressures 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  were 328 billion  compared with 310 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  an increase of 6  in us dollars and 7  in local currency net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2013  were 1318 billion  compared with 1230 billion  for fiscal 2012  an increase of 7  in us dollars and 9  in local currency health  public service financial services and products experienced strong yearoveryear outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 yearoveryear outsourcing revenue growth in local currency was slight in resources and declined in communications media  technology outsourcing revenue growth continued to be moderate compared to the strong yearoveryear growth that we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2013  as some clients slowed the pace and level of their spending and we expect these trends to continue in the near term clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs compared to fiscal 2012  we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower when compared to fiscal 2012  the us dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2013  this resulted in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1  and 2  lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013  respectively assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges we estimate the foreignexchange impact to our fiscal 2014 revenue growth will be 1 lower growth in us dollars than our growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  was approximately 88  flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2013  and within our target range this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 

we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 275000  as of august 31 2013  compared with approximately 266000  as of may 31 2013  and approximately 257000  as of august 31 2012  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services including those delivered through our global delivery network in lowercost locations annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  was 12  flat with both the third quarter of fiscal 2013  and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future for the majority of our personnel compensation increases for fiscal 2013 became effective september 1 2012 as in prior fiscal years we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  was 332  compared with 329  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  gross margin for fiscal 2013  was 329  compared with 323  for fiscal 2012  the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2013  was principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 193  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  compared with 191  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 186  for fiscal 2013  compared with 184  for fiscal 2012  sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities investment in offerings marketing and advertisingrelated activities and acquisitionrelated costs general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate for fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities as well as acquisitionrelated costs our margins could 

be adversely affected if our costmanagement actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 

operating expenses for fiscal 2013  included reorganization benefits of 274 million  as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information see note 3 reorganization benefits costs net to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  was 984 million  compared with 940 million  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  operating income for fiscal 2013  was 4339 million  compared with 3872 million  for fiscal 2012  operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  was 139  compared with 138  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  operating margin for fiscal 2013  was 152  compared with 139  for fiscal 2012  the reorganization benefits of 274 million  recorded during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2013  increased operating margin by 100  basis points excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits operating margin would have been 142  for fiscal 2013  an increase of 30  basis points compared with fiscal 2012  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was 181  the above noted reorganization benefits increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense in addition during fiscal 2013 we recorded a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 absent these items our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  would have been 253  compared with 276 in fiscal 2012 

diluted earnings per share were 493  for fiscal 2013  compared with 384  for fiscal 2012  absent the above noted reorganization benefits and tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share would have been 421 for fiscal 2013  

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the cost of our global delivery network by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  were 840 billion  with consulting bookings of 386 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 454 billion  new contract bookings for fiscal 2013  were 3328 billion  with consulting bookings of 1627 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1701 billion  

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts clients continue to enter into contracts that are converting to revenue at a slower pace and clients have slowed the pace and level of their spending all of which impact the conversion of new contract bookings to revenues information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new contract bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred 

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element the selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of each element vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements if the amount 

of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

 interest income 

interest income for fiscal 2013  was 33 million  a decrease of 10 million  or 23  from fiscal 2012  the decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances 

other expense income net 

other expense income net for fiscal 2013  was 18 million  a decrease of 23 million  from fiscal 2012  the change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2013  compared to net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012  

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was 181  compared with 276  for fiscal 2012  during fiscal 2013  we recorded reorganization benefits of 274 million  which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense the effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of 243 million related to settlements of us federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013 absent these items the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  would have been 253  which is lower than fiscal 2012  primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2013  was 273 million  an increase of 1 million  over fiscal 2012  the increase was due to higher net income of 730 million  offset by a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 7  for fiscal 2013  from 9  for fiscal 2012  

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 493  for fiscal 2013  compared with 384  for fiscal 2012  the 109  increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of 274 million  which increased earnings per share by 038  and the 243 million  tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits which increased earnings per share by 034  excluding the impact of these benefits earnings per share increased 037  compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2012  due to increases of 019  from higher revenues and operating results 013  from a lower effective tax rate excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of us federal tax audits and reorganization benefits and 008  from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 003  from lower nonoperating income for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 was 3303 million an increase of 209 million or 7 over fiscal 2011 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 119 from 121 during this period the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to growth of business development costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2012 were 1811 million a decrease of 9 million or 1 from fiscal 2011 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 65 from 71 during this period the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues in addition during fiscal 2011 we recorded a provision for litigation matters for 75 million or 03 of net revenues which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services 

operating income and operating margin

 interest income 

interest income for fiscal 2012 was 43 million an increase of 1 million or 4 over fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher cash balances 

other income net 

other income net for fiscal 2012 was 5 million a decrease of 10 million from fiscal 2011 the change was driven primarily by lower net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 276 compared with 273 for fiscal 2011 the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 included higher expenses for additions to tax reserves and changes in our geographic mix of income partially offset by higher benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2012  was 271 million a decrease of 4 million or 2 from fiscal 2011  the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 9  for fiscal 2012  from 10  for fiscal 2011  partially offset by an increase in net income of 272 million 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 384 for fiscal 2012 compared with 339 for fiscal 2011 the 045 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of 040 from higher revenues and operating results and 008 from lower weighted average shares outstanding these increases were partially offset by decreases of 002 from a higher effective tax rate and 001 from lower nonoperating income compared with fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends this restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from 340 to 339 for fiscal 2011 for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

 as of august 31 2013  cash and cash equivalents was 56 billion  compared with 66 billion  as of august 31 2012  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



 

 operating activities the reduction in operating cash flow included the impact of a discretionary cash contribution of 500 million made to our us defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2013 which had a net impact of 350 million after tax the reduction in operating cash flow was also due to other changes in operating assets and liabilities including an increase in net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues partially offset by higher net income 

investing activities the 621 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions for additional information see note 6 business combinations and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 507 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of ordinary shares and an increase in cash dividends paid for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities 

as of august 31 2013  we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 



 

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 179 million  and 164 million  of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2013 and 2012  respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of 2560 million  and 003 million  as of august 31 2013 and 2012  respectively 

share purchases and redemptions 

the board of directors of accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced openmarket share purchase program for acquiring accenture plc class a ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of accenture plc class a ordinary shares accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees as of august 31 2013  our aggregate available authorization was 1964 million  for our publicly announced openmarket share purchase and these other share purchase programs 

our share purchase activity during fiscal 2013  was as follows 



  

 we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2014  the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

other share redemptions 

during fiscal 2013  we issued 11019187  accenture plc class a ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of accenture sca class i common shares pursuant to our registration statement on form s3 the “registration statement” the registration statement allows us at our option to issue freely tradable accenture plc class a ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares held by current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees 

subsequent developments 

on september 25 2013  the board of directors of accenture plc declared a semiannual cash dividend of 093  per share on our class a ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 11 2013  accenture plc will cause accenture sca to declare a semiannual cash dividend of 093  per share on its class i common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 8 2013  both dividends are payable on november 15 2013  

on september 25 2013 the board of directors of accenture plc approved 50 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately 696 billion 

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2013  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project in addition our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in august 2013 we early adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately by item reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss see note 4 accumulated other comprehensive loss to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

in september 2012 we adopted guidance issued by the fasb which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements the adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income which are now presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income rather than in the consolidated shareholders’ equity statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity determines that this is the case it is required to perform the prescribed twostep goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit if any if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we adopted this new guidance for our fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

new accounting pronouncement 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the consolidated balance sheet or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset amounts offset and the related net exposure the new guidance will be effective for accenture beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 at which time we will include the required disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollareuro us dollarindian rupee us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarsingapore dollar us dollarjapanese yen us dollarswiss franc us dollarphilippine peso and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee and euroindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our global delivery network for additional information see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2013  it was anticipated that 177 million  of the net losses net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 309 million  and 402 million  as of august 31 2013 and 2012  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2013  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability or stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve developments such as the recent recessions and instability in the us and europe government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year 2012 in the united states commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff deterioration in the chinese economy and the inflationary risks associated with higher commodity prices among other developments may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in europe and north america weakening demand in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting this could result for example in us having to use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance 

economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patters to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions in addition developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid could shift demand to services and solutions where we are less competitive or might require significant investment by us to upgrade enhance or expand our services and solutions to meet that demand companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and 

these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days’ notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract if a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs the client might terminate existing contracts or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays for example in fiscal 2009 we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions and clients being acquired which negatively affected our results of operations it could also result in pressure to reduce the cost of our services for example during fiscal years 2009 and 2010 challenging economic conditions led to our moving work more quickly into our global delivery network than planned in order to respond to client demand to reduce costs which resulted in our revenues being less than anticipated 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected   

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained additionally if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate skills 

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world which allows us to move talent as needed and particularly in emerging markets therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which it can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs 

our equitybased incentive compensation plans are designed to reward highperforming personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate we may 

need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies in these situations we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive our competitors include 

 some competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours for example there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers which has resulted in the convergence of products and services over time our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client andor accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 

in providing services to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our 

information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including a cyberattack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity significant remediation costs legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets our growth strategy might not be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters like the earthquake and resulting tsunami in japan in march 2011 volcanic eruptions floods and other severe weather conditions global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and protection employment and labor relations this includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors agents alliance or joint venture partners and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us in addition these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example the uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency operations in that country or in europe generally may be adversely affected 

because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues operating income and the value of balancesheet items including intercompany payables and receivables originally denominated in other currencies these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods our currency hedging program which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items might not be successful 

as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activities which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources in addition our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations we also face risks that extreme economic conditions political instability or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control for example natural disasters of the type described above some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers additionally both the philippines and india have experienced and other countries may experience political instability and worker strikes india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries including pakistan military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities and other conditions which are described more fully above could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations 

if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including

 the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share further if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

if our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable 

our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing projects to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting work and frequently on our outsourcing work include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale projects or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 16 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners employees and former employees and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from 

relying upon those contractual protections we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in addition to expense litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and litigation results can be unpredictable while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients current areas of significant change include mobility cloudbased computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change which could adversely affect our results of operations   

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliances partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

outsourcing services and the continued expansion of our other services and solutions into new areas subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services 

outsourcing services which represented approximately 44 of our net revenues in fiscal 2012 present different operational risks when compared to our consulting and systems integration services our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our clients’ businesses expose us to claims and harm our reputation and our business 

we have continued to expand our services and solutions into new business areas and we expect to continue to expand our services and solutions in these and other new areas in the future expanding into new areas may expose us to additional regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas we could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients 

we may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements there is a risk that we could face legal liability many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under statement on standards for attestation engagements no 16 and international standard on assurance engagements 3402 formerly referred to as sas 70 if we receive a qualified opinion or do not deliver the audit reports timely our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions including for example our software solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cost us money 

or prevent us from offering some services or solutions any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our operations could be materially adversely affected the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients additionally individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights and the protection in some countries may be very limited we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients information technology security breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies or delivery failures similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners our joint ventures or joint venture partners adversaries in legal proceedings or government regulators as well as members of the investment community or the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

we might not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions 

we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest including from that company’s known and unknown obligations intellectual property or other assets terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring investing in or partnering with a company which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business by their nature joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself particularly when we have a minority position this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional financial legal compliance or operational risks if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions or joint ventures for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to costmanagement to the degree we have done in the past 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation global consolidation of our office space and realignment of portions of our nonclientfacing workforce to lowercost locations these actions and our other costmanagement efforts may not be successful our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability over time we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lowercost locations or otherwise our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments we also have a number of contracts in both outsourcing and consulting in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

changes in our level of taxes and audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in our treatment as an irish company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control increases in the tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable particularly in less developed markets and could become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for 

us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with ireland or the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2012 we had approximately 257000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations finally the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances we might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including bankruptcy and insolvency this could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us in addition in certain geographies and industries some clients have requested extended payment terms more frequently and if this trend continues our cash flows could be adversely affected recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include 

 21 

 as a result of any of the above factors or any of the other risks described in this item 1a “risk factors” our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the us judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland 

similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2012 of ireland the “companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

we are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business we andor our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world we do not expect that any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2012 ” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2012  all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions credit market conditions and levels of business confidence there continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many of the markets where we operate which could impact our business particularly in the united states and europe such volatility and uncertainty has adversely affected and will in the future affect our clients and the levels of business activities in some industries and geographies where we operate which may reduce demand for our services this has also impacted the types of services our clients are demanding for example clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives these changing demand patterns could have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations we continue to monitor this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  were 684 billion  compared with 669 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  an increase of 2  in us dollars and 9  in local currency net revenues for fiscal 2012  were 2786 billion  compared with 2551 billion  for fiscal 2011  an increase of 9  in us dollars and 11  in local currency all of our operating groups experienced yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and continued to moderate in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  we expect the level of yearoveryear growth to continue to moderate in the near term and vary across operating groups and geographic regions with growth in certain areas of our business offset by lower growth or declines in other areas particularly in consulting and in europe 

in our consulting business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  were 374 billion  compared with 388 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  a decrease of 4  in us dollars and an increase of 2  in local currency net consulting revenues for fiscal 2012  were 1556 billion  compared with 1492 billion  for fiscal 2011  an increase of 4  in us dollars and 6  in local currency four of our five operating groups including health  public service financial services resources and products experienced quarterly yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency while communications media  technology experienced a significant decline in quarterly yearoveryear revenue in our consulting business overall clients are exercising caution by reducing their demand for small projects in addition when larger projects are initiated they are of longer duration and convert to revenue at a slower rate these trends have led to lower consulting revenue growth and declines in certain areas of our business and we expect this to continue in the near term clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses we are also experiencing growing demand for our services in emerging technologies including analytics cloud computing and mobility compared to fiscal 2011  we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network and we expect this trend to continue while the business environment remained competitive pricing was relatively stable and we saw some improvement in certain areas of our business 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  were 310 billion  compared with 281 billion  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  an increase of 10  in us dollars and 18  in local currency net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2012  were 1230 billion  compared with 1058 billion  for fiscal 2011  an increase of 16  in us dollars and 19  in local currency all five of our operating groups experienced yearoveryear outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the 

fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  led by very significant growth in financial services and very strong growth in products communication media  technology and resources this strong demand for outsourcing services resulted in a greater proportion of revenues in outsourcing particularly in communications media  technology and financial services and this trend is expected to continue clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs growth in outsourcing was driven by higher volumes scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients as well as services for new clients compared to fiscal 2011  we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower when compared to fiscal 2011  the us dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2012  this resulted in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue results that were approximately 7  and 2  lower than our revenue results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012  respectively 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  was approximately 87  flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2012  and within our target range this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 

we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 257000  as of august 31 2012  compared with approximately 249000  as of may 31 2012  and 236000  as of august 31 2011  the yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services including those delivered through our global delivery network in lowercost locations annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  was 12  down from 13  in the third quarter of fiscal 2012  and 14  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  we evaluate voluntary attrition adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand in addition we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future for the majority of our personnel compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective september 1 2011 as in prior fiscal years we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services or a decrease in demand due to us government spending reductions deploy our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  was 329  compared with 331  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  gross margin for fiscal 2012  was 323  compared with 329  for fiscal 2011  gross margin for fiscal 2012  was lower than for fiscal 2011  principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues including costs associated with integration of acquisitions and investments in offerings partially offset by higher contract profitability 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 191  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  compared with 193  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 184  for fiscal 2012  compared with 193  for fiscal 2011  sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities investment in offerings and marketing and advertisingrelated activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate these actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lowercost locations for fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20 basis points while general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points these decreases were principally due to growth of these costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues in addition during fiscal 2011  we recorded a provision for litigation matters for 75 million or 03 of net revenues which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and 

unbilled services our margins could be adversely affected if our costmanagement actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 

operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  was 940 million  compared with 923 million  for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  operating income for fiscal 2012  was 3872 million  compared with 3470 million  for fiscal 2011  operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  was 138  flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011  operating margin for fiscal 2012  was 139  compared with 136  for fiscal 2011  

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues such as the cost of our global delivery network by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012  were 921 billion  with consulting bookings of 427 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 494 billion  new contract bookings for fiscal 2012  were 3223 billion  with consulting bookings of 1661 billion  and outsourcing bookings of 1562 billion  

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new contract bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred 

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element the selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of each element vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment deferred tax assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications media  technology financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific 

deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to among other things 

 as of august 31 2012  cash and cash equivalents was 66 billion  compared with 57 billion  as of august 31 2011  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 



 

 operating activities the 815 million  increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities including higher collections on net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues 

investing activities the 168 million  decrease in cash used was primarily due to decreased spending on business acquisitions for additional information see note 6 business combinations and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 437 million  increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months including a discretionary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans that is expected to be funded during the first half of fiscal 2013 we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2012  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in march 2012 the company adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” on fair value measurements the guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions ie an exit price additionally any transfers between level 1 and level 2 asset valuation classifications must be disclosed including the reasons for the transfers the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the threelevel hierarchy of fair value measurements see note 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to these consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements the company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollareuro us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarsingapore dollar us dollarphilippine peso us dollarjapanese yen us dollarswiss franc and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee and euroindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our global delivery network 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2012  it was anticipated that 28 million  of the net losses net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 402 million  and 358 million  as of august 31 2012 and 2011  respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2012  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

organizational structure 

on september 1 2009 accenture ltd completed a transaction in which accenture plc organized in ireland became the parent holding company of accenture this transaction is described below under “—history”

history 

prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001 we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners in connection with our transition to a corporate structure our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for accenture ltd class a common shares or in the case of partners in certain countries 

  

accenture sca class i common shares or exchangeable shares issued by accenture canada holdings inc an indirect subsidiary of accenture sca generally partners who received accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of accenture ltd class x common shares which entitled their holders to vote at accenture ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights the combination of the accenture ltd class x common shares and the accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of accenture ltd class a common shares 

in fiscal 2005 we replaced the internal use of the “partner” title with the more comprehensive “senior executive” title and applied the “senior executive” title to our highestlevel employees including those previously referred to as partners however for proper context we continue to use the term “partner” in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability or stock price our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies including us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve and volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets could undermine business confidence both in those markets and other markets and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives or terminate existing contracts which would negatively affect our business growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate for an extended period of time differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may affect demand for our services a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in europe and north america weakening in these markets as a result of high government deficits credit downgrades or otherwise could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans particularly in consulting this could result for example in us not having the level of appropriate personnel where they are needed and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 

our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our services and solutions and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations 

our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins which could be negatively affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product as described above volatile negative or uncertain global economic conditions could negatively affect client demand for our services and solutions in addition developments in the industries we serve which may be rapid could shift demand to services and solutions where we are less competitive or might require significant investment by us to upgrade enhance or expand our services 

  

and solutions to meet that demand companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract if a client is dissatisfied with our services and we are unable to effectively respond to its needs the client might terminate existing contracts or reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide additionally a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contracts are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenues and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of a client changes in management and changes in a client’s strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations cancellations or delays for example in fiscal 2009 we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions and clients being acquired which negatively affected our results of operations it could also result in pressure to reduce the cost of our services for example during fiscal years 2009 and 2010 challenging economic conditions led to our moving work more quickly into our global delivery network than planned in order to respond to client demand to reduce costs which resulted in our revenues being less than anticipated 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for talent is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology and industry developments and grow and manage our business for example if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand as we expand our services and solutions we also hire and must retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than the majority of our personnel if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and retain these professionals our ability to continue to secure work in those industries may suffer 

we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate both local business leaders and people with the appropriate delivery skills 

  

similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis if we are unable to effectively mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if our utilization rate is too low our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant the mobility of our employees also contributes to the effective operation of our global business model increased regulation of immigration or work visas including limitations placed on the number of visas granted limitations on the type of work performed or location in which it can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirements could make it more difficult to deploy our employees on client engagements and could increase costs 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current andor future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies in these situations we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies 

the consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive our competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 some competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are our clients some competitors are more established in certain emerging markets and that may make our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely 

  

dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve while expanding into additional markets if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and clients to competitors which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours for example there has been a continuing trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers which has resulted in the convergence of products and services over time our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to such competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 

in providing services to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including an attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india where we 

  

have the largest number of people in our delivery network located and the philippines where we have the second largest number of people located concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control india and the philippines have experienced natural disasters and are subject to pandemics severe weather conditions including earthquakes volcanoes cyclones typhoons floods and other storms which may occur again and could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities additionally both countries have experienced political instability and worker strikes india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries including pakistan military activity or civil hostilities in the future as well as terrorist activities natural disasters and other conditions which are described more fully below could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand globally and particularly to seek significant growth in our priority emerging markets we cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected in addition emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

  

   

 we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets which are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets 

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence political unrest armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters like the earthquake and resulting tsunami in japan in march 2011 global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and labor relations this includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

in particular in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate andor seek to expand practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 our employees subcontractors agents alliance or joint venture partners 

  

and other third parties with which we associate could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations by us our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations including fines or penalties disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work including us federal contracting any of which could materially adversely affect our business including our results of operations and our reputation 

changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources in connection with our government work which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations 

if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services to enable us to meet our profitability our revenues and profitability expectations could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

 the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways all of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions andor clearly convey the value of our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider in addition the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer increased competition from companies located in lowercost locations has reduced the prices we can charge for some of our services particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets competitors may be willing at times to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share further if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

if our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon which we rely do not meet their commitments then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable 

our pricing for our services and solutions is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver such services and solutions which might be based on 

  

limited data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the effort costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments andor completing projects to a client’s satisfaction our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting work and frequently on our outsourcing work include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with largescale projects or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients if any of the risks discussed above were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face significant legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability because a third party may allege fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide such solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements or if liability limitations are not enforced we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition to expense litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and litigation results can be unpredictable while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons which may affect the timing and amount of our recovery 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients current areas of significant change include mobility cloudbased computing and the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our 

  

clients our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond our core business that will enable us to differentiate our services and solutions if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation our services and solutions our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrants new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives which may adversely affect our results of operations 

outsourcing services subject us to different operational risks than our consulting and systems integration services 

outsourcing services which represented approximately 41 of our net revenues in fiscal 2011 present different operational risks when compared to our consulting and systems integration services our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses which may include the operation of functions that are critical to the core businesses of our clients in fiscal 2011 we expanded our outsourcing services and solutions into new areas such as care management and mortgage processing and we expect to continue to do so expanding into new areas may expose us to additional regulatory or other risks specific to such new areas we could also incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to the services we provide clients 

we may also face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements there is a risk that we could face legal liability many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under statement on auditing standards no 70 sas 70 of the control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them effective june 15 2011 sas 70 was retired and replaced with statement on standards for attestation engagements no 16 and international standard on assurance engagements 3402 if we receive a qualified opinion or do not deliver the audit reports timely our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cost us money or prevent us from offering some services or solutions any related proceedings could require us to expend significant time and effort over an extended period of time in most of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation andor require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology our operations could be materially adversely affected additionally in recent years individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of 

  

infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors former employees or other third parties and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients information technology security breaches or service outages internal control deficiencies or other delivery failures similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients employees competitors vendors and alliance partners adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

  

our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers which are our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor or key alliances partners might merge with each other either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating other businesses 

we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets depending on the opportunities available we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities in addition we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from an acquired company including from terminated employees current or former clients or other third parties and may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to costmanagement to the degree we have done in the past 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation ongoing global consolidation of our office space and realignment of portions of our nonclientfacing workforce to lowercost locations there is no guarantee that these or other costmanagement efforts will be successful that our efficiency will be enhanced or that we will achieve desired levels of 

  

profitability over time we have seen an improvement in general and administrative costs because of the significant steps taken in the past to reduce costs we may not be able to continue to deliver efficiencies in our cost management to the same degree as in the past if we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation of our employees by moving more work to lowercost locations or otherwise our margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our contracts include performance payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets andor require us to meet specific service levels this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins 

many of our contracts include performance clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service levels we also have a number of contracts in both outsourcing and consulting in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

changes in our level of taxes and audits investigations and tax proceedings or changes in our treatment as an irish company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments or may take increasingly aggressive positions with respect to the judgments we make we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control for example ireland faces continuing economic uncertainty including in connection with its outstanding debt obligations these uncertainties have led to discussion regarding a potential increase to the corporate tax rate increases in the tax rate in ireland or any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a negative impact on our profitability in addition changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable particularly in less developed markets and could become more stringent which could materially adversely affect our tax position any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the us and ireland there can be no assurance that legislative or diplomatic action will not be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or 

  

significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with the united states these changes could be exacerbated by economic budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2011 we had approximately 236000 employees worldwide our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations finally the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances for example the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic company information or damage to our reputation if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of any of the above factors or any of the other risks described in this item 1a “risk factors” our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over 

  

financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the united states judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

some companies that conduct business in the united states but are domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to criticism in connection with our current incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2009 of ireland the “companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

  

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

  

  

  

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 2 properties 

we have major offices in the world’s leading business centers including new york london frankfurt paris madrid chicago milan tokyo sao paolo rome bangalore san francisco sydney manila and boston among others in total we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world we do not own any material real property substantially all of our office space is leased under longterm leases with varying expiration dates we believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business we andor our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world we do not expect that any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

as previously reported in april 2007 the us department of justice intervened in a civil “qui tam” action previously filed under seal by two private individuals “relators” in the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas against accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries the complaint as 

  

amended alleged that in connection with work we undertook for the us federal government we received payments resale revenue or other benefits as a result of or otherwise acted improperly in connection with alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of contracts with the us government andor applicable law or regulations similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry on september 9 2011 we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit pursuant to the agreement we agreed to pay the united states 63675 million in consideration for the release of all claims alleged by the government and the relators against us in the matter and we expressly denied any wrongdoing the relators will petition the court for attorneys fees and costs associated with the matter and we expect to have to litigate the basis for and amounts of those fees and costs 

we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2011” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2011 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

our results of operations can be affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions credit market conditions and levels of business confidence revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were 669 billion compared with 542 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 an increase of 23 in us dollars and 14 in local currency net revenues for fiscal 2011 were 2551 billion compared with 2155 billion for fiscal 2010 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 15 in local currency this very strong growth during fiscal 2011 contrasts with a 2 local currency revenue decline during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 all of our operating groups experienced yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 with very strong growth in resources and products based on new contract bookings over the last several quarters we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business we also expect the level of yearoveryear growth will moderate particularly in consulting and vary across operating groups and geographic regions there continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty such volatility and uncertainty should it continue could adversely affect our clients and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 

in our consulting business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were 388 billion compared with 309 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 an increase of 25 in us dollars and 16 in local currency consulting net revenues for fiscal 2011 were 1492 billion compared with 1237 billion for fiscal 2010 an increase of 21 in us dollars and 17 in local currency all five operating groups experienced yearoveryear consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 driven by very strong growth in resources and products in our consulting business overall clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 

  

compared to fiscal 2010 we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network and we expect this trend to continue in the medium term while the business environment remains competitive pricing is stable with some improvement in certain areas of our business 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were 281 billion compared with 233 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 an increase of 21 in us dollars and 13 in local currency outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2011 were 1058 billion compared with 918 billion for fiscal 2010 an increase of 15 in us dollars and 13 in local currency all five operating groups experienced yearoveryear outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 led by communications  high tech and financial services clients continue to be focused on projects that will improve operational effectiveness growth in outsourcing is driven by higher volumes scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients as well as services for new clients as with systems integration consulting compared to fiscal 2010 we are providing a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower when compared to fiscal 2010 the us dollar weakened against many currencies during fiscal 2011 this resulted in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue results that were approximately 9 and 3 better than our results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 respectively 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 85 and within our target range this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 

we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 236000 as of august 31 2011 compared with approximately 223000 as of may 31 2011 and 204000 as of august 31 2010 this 16 yearoveryear increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services including those delivered through our global delivery network in lowercost locations annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 14 compared with 15 in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and 17 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we adjust levels of new hiring evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in addition we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future for the majority of our personnel compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective september 1 2011 as in prior fiscal years we strive to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins 

  

could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis manage attrition recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 331 compared with 340 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 329 compared with 336 for fiscal 2010 our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than fiscal 2010 as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 193 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with 209 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 193 for fiscal 2011 compared with 201 for fiscal 2010 sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities investment in offerings and marketing and advertisingrelated activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues these actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lowercost locations for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 02 while general and administrative costs decreased 06 as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve partially offset by a provision for litigation matters while we continue to manage these costs we expect the reduction in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues to moderate in fiscal 2012 our margins could be adversely affected if our costmanagement actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 

operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 923 million compared with 714 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 operating income for fiscal 2011 was 3470 million compared with 2915 million for fiscal 2010 operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 138 compared with 132 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 136 compared with 135 for fiscal 2010 

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were 844 billion with consulting bookings of 416 billion and outsourcing bookings of 428 billion new contract bookings for fiscal 2011 were 2883 billion with consulting bookings of 1541 billion and outsourcing bookings of 1342 billion 

  

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new contract bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract our contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

  

contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services nontechnology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future 

  

delivery of another element the selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value of each element vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis selling price of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

  

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services health  public service products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does 

  

not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2011 were 1820 million an increase of 152 million or 9 over fiscal 2010 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 71 from 77 during this period the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues as well as a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services due to better than expected bad debt experience partially offset by a provision for litigation matters of 75 million 

  

operating income and operating margin

 interest income 

interest income for fiscal 2011 was 41 million an increase of 11 million or 37 over fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and cash balances 

  

other income expense net 

other income expense net for fiscal 2011 was 17 million an increase of 32 million over fiscal 2010 the change was driven by net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2011 compared with net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2010 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 273 compared with 293 for fiscal 2010 the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal 2011 due to a number of factors that impact our geographic mix of income partially offset by a net increase in reserves related to ongoing tax audits 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2011 was 276 million a decrease of 4 million or 2 from fiscal 2010 the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 10 for fiscal 2011 from 13 for fiscal 2010 partially offset by an increase in net income of 493 million 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 340 for fiscal 2011 compared with 266 for fiscal 2010 the 074 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of 042 from higher revenues and operating results in local currency 011 from lower weighted average shares outstanding 009 from a lower effective tax rate 008 from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and 004 from higher nonoperating income compared with fiscal 2010 for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 was 2658 million an increase of 499 million or 23 over fiscal 2009 and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 123 from 100 during this period the increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a change related to the implementation of our saleseffectiveness model which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other businessdevelopment activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on businessdevelopment activities

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 were 1668 million a decrease of 120 million or 7 from fiscal 2009 and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 77 from 83 during this period the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the 72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as well as expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009 

reorganization and restructuring costs net 

we recorded net reorganization costs of 10 million for fiscal 2010 compared with net reorganization benefits of 3 million for fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2001 we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure for additional information refer to note 3 reorganization and restructuring costs net to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2010 was similar to that disclosed for net revenues in fiscal 2009 each operating group recorded a portion of the 72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter and the 253 million restructuring cost recorded in the fourth quarter additionally in fiscal 2010 each operating group experienced expense savings resulting from the global consolation of office space in fiscal 2009 see “—general and administrative costs” and “—reorganization and restructuring costs net” the commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 exclusive of foreign currency exchange rates bad debt provision and restructuring cost impacts 

 

  

  

  

  

   

interest income 

interest income was 30 million in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 20 million or 40 from fiscal 2009 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates 

other expense net 

other expense net was 16 million in fiscal 2010 an increase of 12 million over fiscal 2009 the change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 293 and 276 respectively the effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prioryear tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 280 million in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 68 million or 20 from fiscal 2009 the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13 for fiscal 2010 from 17 for fiscal 2009 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 266 for fiscal 2010 compared with 244 for fiscal 2009 the 022 increase in fiscal 2010 earnings per share compared with fiscal 2009 earnings per share was primarily due to the following a 024 increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 a 007 increase from a lower share count and a 006 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by the following a 004 decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency a 001 decrease from lower reorganization benefits a 003 decrease from lower nonoperating items and a 007 decrease from a higher effective income tax rate for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to 

 

  

  

  

 as of august 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents was 57 billion compared with 48 billion as of august 31 2010 

  

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 

 

  

 operating activities the 350 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and changes in other operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues 

investing activities the 430 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment for additional information see note 6 business combinations and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

financing activities the 308 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower cash dividends paid as a result of our transition to semiannual dividend payments for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

  

borrowing facilities 

as of august 31 2011 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 

 

  

  

  

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 178 million and 152 million of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of 4 million and 2 million as of august 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2012 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time share repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

other share redemptions

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2011 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in september 2010 we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables the guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendorspecific objective evidence and thirdparty evidence respectively do not exist as estimates of selling price the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollarswiss franc us dollarjapanese yen us dollaraustralian dollar us dollareuro us dollarphilippine peso us dollarsingapore dollar and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso uk poundindian rupee and euroindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by accenture’s global delivery network 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2011 it was anticipated that 9 million of the net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 358 million and 218 million as of august 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2011 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

history 

prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001 we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners in connection with our transition to a corporate structure our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for accenture ltd class a common shares or in the case of partners in certain countries accenture sca class i common shares or exchangeable shares issued by accenture canada holdings inc an indirect subsidiary of accenture sca generally partners who received accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of accenture ltd class x common shares which entitled their holders to vote at accenture ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights the combination of the accenture ltd class x common shares and the accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of accenture ltd class a common shares 

in fiscal 2005 we replaced the internal use of the “partner” title with the more comprehensive “senior executive” title and applied the “senior executive” title to our highestlevel employees including those previously referred to as partners however for proper context we continue to use the term “partner” in certain situations and particularly when discussing our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation 

on june 10 2009 accenture plc was incorporated in ireland as a public limited company in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from bermuda to ireland the “transaction” on august 5 2009 the shareholders of accenture ltd our predecessor holding company voted in favor of the transaction the transaction was subsequently completed on september 1 2009 following approval from the supreme court of bermuda at which time accenture ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of accenture plc and accenture plc became our parent holding company in the transaction all of the outstanding class a and class x common shares of accenture ltd were cancelled and accenture plc issued class a and class x ordinary shares on a oneforone basis to the holders of the cancelled accenture ltd class a and class x common shares as applicable and cash for any fractional shares accenture ltd was dissolved on december 29 2009

accenture plc class a and class x ordinary shares 

each class a ordinary share and each class x ordinary share of accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of accenture plc a class x ordinary share does not however entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of accenture plc as described above under “—history” class x ordinary shares generally provide the holders of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares with a vote at accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by accenture plc class a common shareholders while their economic rights consist of interests in accenture sca class i common shares or in accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares 

under its memorandum and articles of association accenture plc may redeem at its option any class x ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the class x ordinary share or 00000225 per share accenture plc as successor to accenture ltd has separately agreed with the original holders of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares not to redeem any class x ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of class x ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares owned by that holder accenture plc will redeem class x ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of class x ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares outstanding class x ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of accenture plc

accenture sca class i common shares 

only accenture and our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees hold accenture sca class i common shares each class i common share entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to the shareholders of accenture sca and entitles its holder to dividends and liquidation payments as of october 12 2010 accenture holds a voting interest of approximately 89 of the aggregate outstanding accenture sca class i common shares entitled to vote with the remaining 11 of the voting interest held by our current and former senior executives 

accenture sca is obligated at the option of the holder to redeem any outstanding accenture sca class i common share at a redemption price per share generally equal to its current market value as determined in accordance with accenture sca’s articles of association under accenture sca’s articles of association the market value of a class i common share that is not subject to transfer restrictions will be deemed to be equal to i the average of the high and low sales prices of an accenture plc class a ordinary share as reported on the new york stock exchange or on such other designated market on 

  

which the class a ordinary shares trade net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs or ii if accenture plc sells its class a ordinary shares on the date that the redemption price is determined other than in a transaction with any employee or an affiliate or pursuant to a preexisting obligation the weighted average sales price of an accenture plc class a ordinary share on the new york stock exchange or on such other market on which the class a ordinary shares primarily trade net of customary brokerage and similar transaction costs accenture sca may at its option pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering accenture plc class a ordinary shares on a oneforone basis this oneforone redemption price and exchange ratio will be adjusted if accenture plc holds more than a de minimis amount of assets other than its interest in accenture sca and assets it holds only transiently prior to contributing them to accenture sca or incurs more than a de minimis amount of liabilities other than liabilities for which accenture sca has a corresponding liability to accenture plc we have been advised by our legal advisors in luxembourg that there is no relevant legal precedent in luxembourg quantifying or defining the term “de minimis” in the event that a question arises in this regard we expect that management will interpret “de minimis” in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time in question at this time accenture plc does not intend to hold any material assets other than its interest in accenture sca or to incur any material liabilities such that this oneforone redemption price and exchange ratio would require adjustment and will disclose any change in its intentions that could affect this ratio in order to maintain accenture plc’s economic interest in accenture sca accenture plc generally will acquire additional accenture sca common shares each time additional accenture plc class a ordinary shares are issued 

at the annual general meeting of shareholders of accenture sca to be held on november 15 2010 the shareholders of accenture sca will be asked to vote on an amendment to the definition of “valuation ratio” contained in article 24 of accenture sca’s articles of association this amendment will fix the ratio used for determination of the redemption price or number of shares of accenture plc class a ordinary shares to be issued upon a redemption of class i common shares from the limited shareholders as defined in the articles of association the definition of “valuation ratio” originally contained in article 24 had the effect of limiting the flexibility of accenture plc and its predecessor the general partner of accenture sca because it provided that if a material amount of separate assets or liabilities were acquired including from accenture sca or liabilities were incurred by accenture plc or its predecessor then the valuation ratio was subject to adjustment “in order to reflect the relative fair market values of” an accenture plc class a ordinary share and a class i common share of sca this adjustment would not be made pursuant to a predetermined formula but rather would occur using a “process for equitable adjustment” to be agreed upon by the general partner of accenture sca as well as the shareholders or a third party arbitrator if they could not agree the nature and methodology of such adjustments were not clearly delineated and since such adjustments could have potentially affected the value that the limited shareholders would receive when they sought to redeem their sca shares the general partner did not acquire or incur any separate material assets or liabilities 

the effect of the proposed amendment is to reduce such uncertainty by ensuring that the valuation ratio will remain fixed subject to customary antidilution adjustments and therefore facilitate accenture plc’s ability to acquire assets including from third parties or accenture sca and incur liabilities without the need to consider adjusting the ratio used for determining the number of accenture plc class a ordinary shares delivered in redemption of or used to calculate the redemption price for class i common shares after giving effect to the amendment the ratio shall except in connection with certain transactions affecting the capital stock of accenture plc be onetoone such that one share of accenture plc shall be delivered in redemption or used to calculate the redemption price for each class i common share of accenture sca accenture plc and accenture sca believe that eliminating this provision at this time will provide accenture plc with greater flexibility to create a more efficient corporate structure including by acquiring assets from accenture sca and otherwise engage in transactions that will 

  

promote shareholder value if accenture plc acquires assets from accenture sca accenture sca will need to determine the relative values of the acquired assets and the assets remaining at accenture sca this will expose the limited shareholders to the risk that if these determinations do not accurately reflect the current or future values of the assets the value of the limited shareholders interest in accenture sca could be adversely affected however this risk will be mitigated because the limited shareholders will continue to enjoy the benefit of their redemption rights based on a fixed onetoone ratio for accenture plc shares which will allow them to share in the value of the assets that had been acquired from accenture sca 

except in the case of a redemption of class i common shares or a transfer of class i common shares to accenture plc or one of its subsidiaries accenture sca’s articles of association provide that accenture sca class i common shares may be transferred only with the consent of the general partner of accenture sca in addition all holders of class i common shares except accenture are precluded from having their shares redeemed by accenture sca or transferred to accenture sca accenture plc or a subsidiary of accenture plc at any time or during any period when accenture sca determines based on the advice of counsel that there is material nonpublic information that may affect the average price per share of accenture plc class a ordinary shares if the redemption would be prohibited by applicable law during an underwritten offering due to an underwriters lockup or during the period from the announcement of a tender offer by accenture sca or its affiliates for accenture sca class i common shares until the expiration of ten business days after the termination of the tender offer other than to tender the holder’s accenture sca class i common shares in the tender offer 

accenture sca class ii and class iii common shares 

on november 16 2009 the shareholders of accenture sca approved amendments to accenture sca’s articles of association pursuant to which all of the class ii common shares and class iii common shares of accenture sca which were all held by accenture were reclassified into class i common shares with the same rights as the class i common shares that existed prior to november 16 2009 as described above under “—accenture sca class i common shares” including being entitled to the payment of cash dividends this amendment had no effect on the relative economic rights of accenture plc or the other holders of accenture sca class i common shares 

accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares 

holders of accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for accenture plc class a ordinary shares at any time on a oneforone basis accenture may at its option satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an accenture plc class a ordinary share at the time of the exchange each exchangeable share of accenture canada holdings inc entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an accenture plc class a ordinary share entitles its holder the exchange of all of the outstanding accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares for accenture plc class a ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of accenture or the other shareholders of accenture sca 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations including revenues and profitability or stock price the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

  

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve and negative or uncertain economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability for example the global economic downturn that began to affect our business in fiscal 2009 reduced demand for our services and caused clients to request additional price concessions changes in global economic conditions could cause our clients or potential clients to reduce or defer their spending on new technologies or initiatives in order to focus on other priorities and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain growth in the primary markets we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate for an extended period of time differing patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may affect demand for our services ongoing economic uncertainties also affect our business in a number of other ways making it more difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities specifically if we are unable to forecast client demand for our services accurately we might be unable to effectively plan for or respond to economic changes this could result for example in not having the appropriate personnel where they are needed and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations any of these economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments to serve the evolving needs of our clients our growth strategy focuses on driving innovation for our core business as well as through new business initiatives beyond the core business if we are not able to successfully drive innovation in our services and solutions our results of operations and ability to grow could be negatively affected if in response to client demand we move work more quickly into our global delivery network than planned our revenues may be less than we anticipated 

in addition we operate in a quickly evolving environment the services or technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our offerings less competitive or obsolete technological developments may arise that materially affect the commercial viability of our offerings if we are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to these technological developments our ability to obtain or successfully deliver client work may be negatively affected 

the consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies including 

 

  

   

 

  

 in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide some of our competitors are companies that may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals 

the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways all of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider increased competition from companies located in lowercost locations has put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets and is likely to continue to do so some of our competitors are willing at times to price contracts with low or negative margins in an effort to increase market share further if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices 

even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are accenture clients some of our competitors are more established in emerging markets and this may make our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging additionally our competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms which may affect our ability to win work 

in addition we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as a result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers within the last two years we have seen significant consolidation that has resulted in the convergence of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation additionally vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services software and hardware to clients than we can if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack such buyers may direct more business to our competitors and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

   

 

  

  

  

  

   

 

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients additionally because of their visibility and political nature government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation if any of the risks discussed above were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us a subcontractor or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us 

many of our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive projectbyproject basis although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our consulting contracts we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients on short notice and some without notice many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these shorterduration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice and without significant cost to the client longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract additionally large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally for example in fiscal 2009 we experienced a higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings as a result of challenging economic conditions which negatively affected our results of operations when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to replace the lost revenue or it may take significant time to replace with other work or eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected 

  

 

outsourcing services are a significant part of our business and subject us to additional operational and financial risk 

we earned approximately 43 of our net revenues in fiscal 2010 from our outsourcing services this portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting and systems integration services our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses in some cases we may deliver those services using client personnel and thirdparty contracts that are transferred to us from time to time however we assume responsibility for delivering our services using client personnel or client subcontractors who are not transferred to us and we therefore have less ability to fully control their work and efforts in addition we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients’ businesses that are transferred to us this type of work also presents financial risks to us outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly during the first year of the contract this could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time furthermore we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques and terms sometimes assisted by thirdparty advisors 

in addition we may face exposure in our outsourcing business if we contribute to internal controls issues of a client if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures at the client or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements there is a risk that we could face legal liability many of our clients request that we obtain an audit under statement on auditing standards no 70 of the control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them we cannot guarantee that we will receive an unqualified opinion in any such audit and our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner 

our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing 

if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services our revenues and profitability could materially suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world our business the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients and grow and manage our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition if our utilization rate is too low our profitability could suffer the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees and our need to devote time to business development and other nonchargeable activities place significant demands on our resources the mobility of our employees also contributes to the effective operation of our global business model and increased regulation of immigration or work visas could make this more difficult 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current or future demand in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs our geographic expansion strategy in our strategic growth markets and other emerging markets depends in part on our ability to attract and retain both business leaders and people with the appropriate delivery skills additionally if demand were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs at certain times however we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies in these situations we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in those geographies 

our ability to grow our revenues and increase profitability could be adversely affected if we cannot effectively manage employee hiring assimilation and retention to meet client demand maintain a favorable utilization rate and achieve an efficient workforce structure 

our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to third parties including clients alliance partners and other parties with whom we conduct business or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients we may enter into agreements with nonstandard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face significant legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on 

  

the scope of our potential liability because a third party may allege fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections a failure of a client’s system based on our services or solutions could subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide such solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements or if liability limitations are not enforced we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition to expense litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and litigation results can be unpredictable 

if our pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

our pricing for all of our services and solutions is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects to a client’s satisfaction or we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties our contracts could prove unprofitable or yield lower profit margins than anticipated our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work and sometimes other types of work frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings for the client from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this risk could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

many of our contracts include performance payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets this could increase the variability of our revenues and margins 

many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could reduce our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms additionally we have a number of contracts in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients information technology security breaches or service outages or other delivery failures similarly our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention 

  

efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us materially adversely affecting our share price 

our alliance relationships may not be successful or may change which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own many of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by our alliance partners see “business—alliances” the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor if our alliances are less successful we may be less competitive our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines which may expose us to operational risks 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery network in which accenture personnel are based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world under this strategy we have continued to shift personnel and processes to locations where we can perform both outsourcing and consulting work at lower cost than in more highlydeveloped markets such as western europe or north america while these delivery centers are located throughout the world we have based large portions of our delivery network in india and the philippines concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks many of which are beyond our control india and the philippines have experienced severe weather conditions including cyclones typhoons and other storms which may occur again and could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to our facilities additionally both countries have experienced political instability and worker strikes our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective particularly if catastrophic events occur if any of these circumstances occurs we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel and any downtime in important processes we operate for clients could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace 

as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion we are more susceptible to certain risks 

we have offices and operations in 53 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 120 countries in fiscal 2010 approximately 44 of our net revenues were attributable to the americas region 44 were attributable to the europe middle east and africa region “emea” and 12 were attributable to the asia pacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world as well as more than 50 delivery centers one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue our geographic expansion in emerging markets which generally involve greater financial and operational risks such as those described below than our more mature markets if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us 

  

 

our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our results of operations in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

  

  

 international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations acts of terrorist violence armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes onerous or conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions immigration antibribery internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and labor relations this includes in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

legislation related to certain nonus corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture however additional legislative proposals remain under consideration which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions for example because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business changes in laws and regulations to limit using offshore resources which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions could adversely affect our results of operations if we are not able to transfer the affected work to other parts of our global delivery network in a timely manner and without materially impacting our results of operations 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from us federal contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients alliance partners and vendors the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 

in providing services to clients we often manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and 

  

number change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties including an attack by viruses worms or other malicious software programs could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we could be subject to liabilities or damage our relationships with clients if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner cannot meet their commitments on time or at all 

large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers including companies with which we have alliances our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance some of this work involves new technologies which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted in some cases these subcontractors are small firms and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services with largescale projects or enterprises in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or we cannot substitute alternative technology from another source our operations could be materially adversely affected additionally in recent years individuals and firms have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

  

 

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

changes in our level of taxes and audits investigations and tax proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate tax accounting often involves complex matters and judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities however our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws furthermore changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable and could materially adversely affect our tax position any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if our costmanagement strategies are unsuccessful 

our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues this includes executing an increasing amount of our client delivery using geographically distributed workforces in lowercost locations in our global delivery network we have also taken 

  

actions to reduce certain costs and these initiatives include without limitation ongoing global consolidation of our office space and realignment of portions of our nonclientfacing workforce to lowercost locations there is no guarantee that these or other costmanagement efforts will be successful that our efficiency will be enhanced or that we will achieve desired levels of profitability if we are not effective in reducing our operating costs in the face of changes in demand or pricing our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to criticism negative publicity and legislative or regulatory action related to our incorporation in ireland 

some companies that conduct business in the united states but are domiciled in certain offshore jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies accenture never conducted business under a us parent company and pays us taxes on all of its us operations nonetheless we could be subject to similar criticism in connection with our incorporation in bermuda for eight years and current incorporation in ireland 

although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the us and ireland there can be no assurance that legislative or diplomatic action will not be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense congressional proposals could change the definition of a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with the united states 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be enacted in a way to negatively affect accenture 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2010 we had approximately 204000 employees worldwide our size presents significant management and organizational challenges it may become increasingly difficult to maintain 

  

effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires in addition it may become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations finally the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all our employees our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

we may not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating other businesses 

we expect to continue our program of pursuing tactical acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities expand in emerging markets and other countries or develop new services and solutions we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations furthermore we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

   

 

  

  

 our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of any of the above factors or any of the other risks described in this item 1a “risk factors” our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be materially adversely affected 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent 

  

limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the united states judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2009 of ireland “the companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

  

 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

  

  

  

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

as previously reported in april 2007 the us department of justice the “doj” intervened in a civil “qui tam” action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas against accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries the complaint as amended alleges that in connection with work we undertook for the us federal government we received payments resale revenue or other benefits as a result of or otherwise acted improperly in connection with alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the us government andor applicable law or regulations similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry the suit alleges that these amounts and relationships were not disclosed to the government in violation of the federal false claims act and the antikickback act among other statutes the doj complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits while the complaint does not allege damages with specificity the amount sought by the doj will depend on the theories it pursues and could be significant the suit could lead to other related proceedings and actions by various agencies of the us government including potential suspension or debarment proceedings we intend to defend such matters vigorously and do not believe they will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

we use the terms “accenture” “we” the “company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc an irish public limited company and its subsidiaries or prior to september 1 2009 to accenture ltd a bermuda exempted company that on that date became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2010” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2010 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

we use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prioryear period’s foreign currency exchange rates this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

overview 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions credit market conditions and levels of business confidence revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were 542 billion compared with 515 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 an increase of 5 in us dollars and 8 in local currency although some industries and geographies where we operate continue to be impacted by the economic downturn that began to adversely affect our business in january 2009 overall market demand for our services has improved in recent quarters based on new contract bookings recorded in fiscal 2010 we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 four of our five operating groups including products financial services resources and communications  high tech experienced quarterly yearoveryear revenue growth in local currency looking forward we anticipate that the level of growth will vary across segments and geographic regions and between consulting and outsourcing services in addition given there is still economic uncertainty in some markets around the world our ability to effectively respond to changing client demand patterns will be a key driver of our performance 

net revenues for fiscal 2010 were 2155 billion compared with 2158 billion in fiscal 2009 flat in us dollars and a decrease of 2 in local currency during fiscal 2010 many of the industries and geographies where we operate continued to be impacted by the economic downturn this adversely affected our yearoveryear consulting and outsourcing revenue growth primarily in the first half of fiscal 2010 

in our consulting business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were 309 billion compared with 291 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 an increase of 6 in us dollars and 9 in local currency consulting net revenues for fiscal 2010 were 1237 billion compared with 1256 

  

billion for fiscal 2009 a decrease of 1 in us dollars and 4 in local currency although fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflect the impact of the economic downturn overall market demand for our consulting services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter we experienced quarterly yearoveryear consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 consulting growth in four of our five operating groups led by products and financial services was offset by a decline in health  public service primarily due to our public service business we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lowercost resources in our global delivery network this trend is resulting in work volume growing faster than revenues and we expect this to continue in the medium term clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver near and mediumterm cost savings and performance improvement projects with growth and transformational objectives are returning however clients remain cautious seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work in addition the pricing environment continues to be competitive 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were 233 billion compared with 223 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 an increase of 4 in us dollars and 7 in local currency outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2010 were 918 billion compared with 902 billion for fiscal 2009 an increase of 2 in us dollars and flat in local currency overall market demand for our outsourcing services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010 and we are beginning to experience higher volumes and scope expansions on existing contracts beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter we experienced quarterly yearoveryear outsourcing revenue growth in local currency with significant growth in products however our outsourcing revenue growth during fiscal 2010 continued to be adversely impacted in three operating groups primarily in financial services and to a lesser extent in communications  high tech and resources by the higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings that began to affect our business after the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we do not expect the fiscal 2009 contract terminations and restructurings to have a material yearoveryear impact to outsourcing revenue growth in future periods in addition we are providing a greater proportion of outsourcing services through use of lowercost resources at reduced price levels 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations if the us dollar weakens against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies resulting in unfavorable currency translation our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower when compared to fiscal 2009 the us dollar weakened against many currencies in fiscal 2010 this resulted in favorable currency translation and us dollar revenue results that were approximately 2 better than our results in local currency for fiscal 2010 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts utilization represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 86 flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 a decrease from 88 for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with our target range this level of utilization reflects continued demand for resources in our global delivery network as well as an increase in demand in certain countries including the united states we are actively hiring to meet current and projected future demand 

our costmanagement strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing costmanagement initiatives we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take 

  

actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses these costmanagement strategies also include executing an increasing amount of our client delivery from our global delivery network in lowercost locations based on current and projected future demand we increased our headcount the majority of which serve our clients to approximately 204000 as of august 31 2010 compared with approximately 177000 as of august 31 2009 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 17 flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with historical levels prior to the economic downturn this compares with 10 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we adjust levels of new hiring evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in addition we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future compensation increases for fiscal 2011 which for the majority of our personnel were effective september 1 2010 are higher than in the prior fiscal year as in prior fiscal years we expect to adjust pricing andor the mix of resources to reduce the impact of this on our gross margin our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to hire sufficient employees with the skills and background where they are needed manage attrition recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 340 compared with 323 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 gross margin for fiscal 2010 was 336 compared with 317 for fiscal 2009 as discussed more fully below the primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our saleseffectiveness model which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other businessdevelopment activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on businessdevelopment activities 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 209 for the fourth quarter fiscal 2010 compared with 191 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 201 for fiscal 2010 compared with 183 for fiscal 2009 sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities investment in service offerings and marketing and advertisingrelated activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space we continuously monitor these costs and implement costmanagement actions as appropriate to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues these actions include performing a greater proportion of these activities in lowercost locations during fiscal 2010 we directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other businessdevelopment activities and we streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on businessdevelopment activities the combination of these two factors has resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for our clientservices personnel being directed to sales and marketing rather than to other activities which are typically captured in cost of services we have not reclassified fiscal 2009 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation as it would be impractical to do so the increase in sales and marketing in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009 in addition in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 general and administrative costs included a bad debt provision of 72 million which reflected our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables particularly from clients in highrisk industries or with potential liquidity issues our margins could be adversely affected if our costmanagement actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues 

  

 

operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 714 million compared with 420 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 132 compared with 82 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 operating income for fiscal 2010 was 2915 million compared with 2644 million for fiscal 2009 operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 135 compared with 123 for fiscal 2009 restructuring costs of 253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009 excluding the effects of the restructuring costs operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009 

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

bookings and backlog 

new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were 651 billion with consulting bookings of 354 billion and outsourcing bookings of 297 billion new contract bookings for fiscal 2010 were 2498 billion with consulting bookings of 1362 billion and outsourcing bookings of 1136 billion 

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts clients are seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new contract bookings are recorded using thenexisting foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice and some without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from 

  

those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimated revenues used in applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 

  

outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

  

 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

  

 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services health  public service formed on september 1 2009 by combining various healthcarerelated components of our products operating group with our public service operating group products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

 interest income 

interest income was 30 million in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 20 million or 40 from fiscal 2009 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates 

other expense net 

other expense net was 16 million in fiscal 2010 an increase of 12 million from fiscal 2009 the change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 293 and 276 respectively the effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prioryear tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 280 million in fiscal 2010 a decrease of 68 million or 20 from fiscal 2009 the decrease was due to a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13 for fiscal 2010 from 17 for fiscal 2009

general and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were 1789 million a decrease of 92 million or 5 from fiscal 2008 and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 83 from 80 over this period the increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of 72 million or 03 of net revenues this provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables in light of global economic conditions particularly from clients in highrisk industries or with potential liquidity issues 

restructuring and reorganization costs net 

we recorded restructuring costs of 253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 these costs included 111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 142 million related to realignment of our workforce primarily at the seniorexecutive level to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future 

we recorded net reorganization benefits of 3 million for fiscal 2009 which included a 16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities we recorded net reorganization costs of 23 million for fiscal 2008 related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities in fiscal 2001 we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure for additional information refer to note 3 restructuring and reorganization costs net to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

 while we saw our net revenues contract due to both the global economic downturn and significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability particularly in our outsourcing business this improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues in addition each operating group recorded a portion of the 72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and a portion of the 253 million restructuring cost see “—general and administrative costs” and “—restructuring and reorganization costs net” during fiscal 2009 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreignexchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues the operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate bad debt provision and restructuring impacts 

 

  

  

  

   

 

 interest income 

interest income was 50 million in fiscal 2009 a decrease of 65 million or 56 from fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 276 and 293 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prioryear tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income of accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc since january 2002 noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 348 million in fiscal 2009 a decrease of 157 million or 31 from fiscal 2008 the change was due to a 259 million decrease in net income and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17 for fiscal 2009 from 22 for fiscal 2008 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 244 for fiscal 2009 compared with 265 for fiscal 2008 the 021 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of 253 million in pretax restructuring costs which reduced earnings per share by 024 absent the restructuring costs earnings per share increased 003 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the following increases of 011 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency 011 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 006 from a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by decreases of 020 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared with fiscal 2008 and 005 from other items including reorganization benefits and nonoperating items for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities in addition we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings we may use our available or additional funds to 

 

  

  

  

   

 

as of august 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents was 4838 million compared with 4542 million as of august 31 2009 an increase of 297 million cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 

 

  

 operating activities the 69 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net use of cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income 

investing activities the 29 million increase in cash used was primarily due to lower net proceeds from availableforsale investments and increased spending on business acquisitions partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment 

financing activities the 579 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increases in cash dividends paid and net purchases of shares for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2010 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

  

 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

on september 1 2009 we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” on business combinations the guidance establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase expensing acquisitionrelated costs as incurred and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination the adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on september 1 2009 we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on noncontrolling interests which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary previously referred to as minority interest to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as required the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the fasb issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables the new guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance and requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price the new guidance requires that a vendor use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendorspecific objective evidence and thirdparty evidence respectively do not exist as estimates of selling price this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollarswiss franc us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarnorwegian krone us dollarphilippine peso us dollar japanese yen and us dollardanish krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso and uk poundindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by accenture’s global delivery network 

for designated cash flow hedges gains and losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2010 it is anticipated that 1 million of the net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 218 million and 180 million as of august 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2010 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve the global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 has reduced and may further reduce demand for our services and has also caused clients to request additional price concessions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if current global economic conditions continue or worsen or if economic contraction continues in the industries or geographies where we operate our business could be adversely affected by our clients’ financial condition and the levels of business activity in the industries we serve changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

our results of operations could be negatively affected if we cannot expand and develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand 

our success depends on our ability to develop and implement consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry developments and client needs we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace implementing new services or solutions for our clients may entail more risk than supplying existing offerings also services solutions and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain or successfully deliver client work 

  

the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies including 

 

  

  

  

 in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals additionally some of our competitors particularly those located in regions with lower costs of doing business may be able to provide services and solutions at lower cost or on terms more attractive to clients than we can particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are accenture clients if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices our results of operations may suffer 

in addition we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers the result of this vertical integration may be greater convergence of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies additionally because of their visibility and political nature government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation either of these could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients including a significant amount procured on a solesource basis our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us a subcontractor or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in 

  

particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us 

many of our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive projectbyproject basis although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our consulting contracts we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these shorterduration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice and without significant cost longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract additionally large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work 

terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to replace the lost revenue with other work or eliminate associated costs in a timely manner there is a risk we could experience a significant number of terminations consequently our revenues andor profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected 

outsourcing services are a significant part of our business and subject us to operational and financial risk 

we earned approximately 42 of our net revenues in fiscal 2009 from our outsourcing services this portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting and systems integration services our outsourcing services involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses in some cases we may deliver those services using client personnel and thirdparty contracts that are transferred to us occasionally however we assume responsibility for delivering our services using client personnel or client subcontractors who are not transferred to us and we therefore have less ability to fully control their work and efforts in addition we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients’ businesses that are transferred to us 

this type of work also presents financial risks to us outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly during the first year of the contract this could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time furthermore we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques and terms sometimes assisted by thirdparty advisors 

  

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if our clients or potential clients do not embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain a favorable utilization rate 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability our utilization rate is affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 if our utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition if our utilization rate is too low our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

  

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to clients or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

if our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated this also applies to outsourcing contracts as many of these projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations utilizing workforces with different skillsets furthermore on outsourcing work we occasionally hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing contract there is a risk that we will underprice our contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts this could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that links some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets this could increase the variability of our revenues and margins 

many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could reduce our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms additionally we have a number of contracts many of which are outsourcing contracts in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on factors such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

our alliance relationships may not be successful 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own see “business—alliances” as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not 

  

prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors loss of or limitations on our relationships with them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in 52 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 120 countries in fiscal 2009 approximately 44 of our net revenues were attributable to the americas region 46 were attributable to the europe middle east and africa region “emea” and 10 were attributable to the asia pacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world as well as more than 50 delivery centers if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our operating results in us dollars a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us 

 

  

  

 international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results acts of terrorist violence armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations 

  

around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies our clients may request that we provide an audit of control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

legislation related to certain nonus corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture however additional legislative proposals remain under consideration which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from us federal contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information we are also required at times to manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability in an environment of continuing pricing pressure we may be forced to permanently adjust our pricing policies and delivery capabilities and our profitability may be impaired if we cannot sustain or improve our cost management efforts our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs might not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing our longterm costreduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in costs for service delivery and infrastructure rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and skillbased workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand we must hire retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require in these cases we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs additionally if demand were to escalate at a high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profit margins at other times however we may have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies in these situations we must evaluate voluntary attrition and use increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in 

  

balance with client demand our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring attrition and severance to achieve an efficient workforce structure 

we could be subject to liabilities if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner cannot deliver their project contributions on time or at all 

large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with project requirements as well as on our effective oversight of their performance in addition certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues profitability or cash flow 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

  

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights these laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations further the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

legislative or regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us 

changes in tax laws treaties or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement may be unpredictable and could adversely affect our tax position although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the us and ireland there are pending us legislative proposals which could override such treaty and which could subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense similarly congressional proposals could change the circumstances under which we would be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes which could also subject us to increased taxation in addition we could be adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate including their treaties with the united states 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced andor enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain us companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states while accenture was not a us company that reincorporated outside the united states these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be enacted in a way to affect accenture 

we may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland 

there has been negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct business in the united states but are domiciled in certain other countries while we were never a us company some former us companies that have undertaken expatriation transactions to offshore jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding us taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over us companies we could be subject to similar criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland 

  

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

as of august 31 2009 we had approximately 177000 employees worldwide our size presents significant management and organizational challenges it takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires it is difficult to maintain common standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowhow in addition it can be difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values strategies and goals finally the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

we may not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating other businesses or technologies 

we expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities however there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired financial or operating results furthermore we face numerous risks in integrating any businesses we might acquire we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings 

  

government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate including in response to variability in revenues operating results and profitability and as a result our share price could be difficult to predict 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our revenues operating results and profitability to vary include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

as a result of any of these factors our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be adversely affected 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states 

we are organized under the laws of ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the laws of ireland do however as a general rule provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the united states judgment the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction and the judgment may not be recognized if it is based on public policy was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice would not be enforced in ireland similarly judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as an irish company we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2009 of ireland “the companies acts” the companies acts differ in some significant and possibly material respects from laws applicable to us corporations and shareholders 

  

under various state corporation laws including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

under irish law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law and may only do so in limited circumstances directors of an irish company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act with due care and skill honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

  

  

  

 any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

as previously reported in april 2007 the us department of justice the “doj” intervened in a civil “qui tam” action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas against accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries the complaint as amended alleges that in connection with work we undertook for the us federal government we received payments resale revenue or other benefits as a result of or otherwise acted improperly in connection with alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the us government andor applicable law or regulations similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry the suit alleges that these amounts and relationships were not disclosed to the government in violation of the federal false claims act and the antikickback act among other statutes the doj complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits while the complaint does not allege damages with specificity the amount sought by the doj will depend on the theories it pursues and could be significant the suit could lead to other related proceedings and actions by various agencies of the us government including potential suspension or debarment or criminal proceedings the doj is currently conducting an additional investigation regarding certain of the alleged conduct and relationships at issue in the suit and we are cooperating with the doj in that investigation we intend to defend such matters vigorously and do not believe they will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

we use the terms “accenture” “we” “our company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture plc an irish public limited company and its subsidiaries or prior to september 1 2009 to accenture ltd a bermuda exempted company that on that date became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of accenture plc and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2009” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2009 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 

overview 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions credit market conditions and levels of business confidence revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges we add value to clients and drive revenues based on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

the global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 was widespread leading to economic contraction in many industries and geographies where we operate it also impacted the needs of our clients and the revenues in our consulting and outsourcing businesses these changing demand patterns have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our new contract bookings and revenue growth compared to the prior fiscal year 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for fiscal 2009 were 2158 billion compared with 2339 billion in fiscal 2008 a decrease of 8 in us dollars and flat in local currency net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were 515 billion compared with 600 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 a decrease of 14 in us dollars and 7 in local currency 

  

in our consulting business net revenues for fiscal 2009 were 1256 billion compared with 1412 billion for fiscal 2008 a decrease of 11 in us dollars and 4 in local currency consulting net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were 291 billion compared with 361 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 a decrease of 19 in us dollars and 12 in local currency starting in january 2009 the global economic downturn led to lower current demand for new consulting services many clients are focused on initiatives designed to deliver near and mediumterm cost savings and performance improvement some clients continue to exercise caution and to seek flexibility in launching new large consulting commitments and instead have shifted to a more phased approach to contracting work certain clients have slowed the pace of ongoing projects andor have deferred decisions to expand scope beyond current commitments in addition we are experiencing pricing pressures from some clients and in response where practicable have shifted to lowercost resources at reduced price levels particularly in our systems integration business 

in our outsourcing business net revenues for fiscal 2009 were 902 billion compared with 927 billion for fiscal 2008 a decrease of 3 in us dollars and an increase of 6 in local currency outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were 223 billion compared with 239 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 a decrease of 7 in us dollars and an increase of 1 in local currency in response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions and more favorable contract terms we have shifted and expect to continue to shift to lowercost resources at a reduced price level in addition we have experienced a lower volume of scope expansions on existing contracts client strategy changes and consolidations have also resulted in more contract terminations and restructuring primarily in financial services and to a lesser extent in communications  high tech and resources 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations during the majority of fiscal 2008 the us dollar weakened against many currencies resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues however beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the us dollar began to strengthen against many currencies and this trend continued until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the foreignexchange impact on our full fiscal 2009 revenue growth was approximately 8 lower growth in us dollars compared to our growth in local currency in the future if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies our revenue growth in us dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency if the us dollar weakens against other currencies our revenue growth in us dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable consulting work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 86 an increase from 83 for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and was at the top of the range we expected utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 84 sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek to manage as a percentage of revenues at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prioryear periods 

operating expenses in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring costs of 253 million recorded in the fourth quarter these costs included 111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 

  

142 million related to realignment of our workforce primarily at the seniorexecutive level to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future restructuring costs are reflected in operating expenses along with reorganization costs and benefits which may vary substantially from year to year reorganization costs and benefits were immaterial in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 323 compared with 317 for fiscal 2008 gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 317 compared with 307 for fiscal 2008 the increase for both periods was driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability 

our costmanagement strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing costmanagement initiatives in addition to the workforce actions included in the restructuring costs we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take ongoing actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses based on current and projected future demand we have reduced our headcount to approximately 177000 as of august 31 2009 compared with more than 186000 as of august 31 2008 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for fiscal 2009 was 10 compared to 16 for fiscal 2008 we evaluate voluntary attrition and have used increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage headcount attrition and severance costs recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 183 for fiscal 2009 compared with 177 for fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and a bad debt provision of 75 million or 03 of net revenues this provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables in light of the current global economic conditions particularly from clients in highrisk industries or with potential liquidity issues 

operating income for fiscal 2009 was 2644 million compared with 3012 million for fiscal 2008 operating margin operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 was 123 compared with 129 for fiscal 2008 operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 420 million compared with 785 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 82 compared with 131 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the restructuring costs of 253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009 excluding the effects of the restructuring costs operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008 

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs due to the significant strengthening of the us dollar against many other currencies this impact was unfavorable during fiscal 2009 most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues for more information on our hedging programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements”

new contract bookings for fiscal 2009 were 2390 billion with consulting bookings of 1278 billion and outsourcing bookings of 1112 billion new contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were 554 billion with consulting bookings of 287 billion and outsourcing bookings of 268 billion 

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and changes to existing contracts we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years new contract bookings are recorded using thenexisting currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes 

revenue recognition 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimated revenues for applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or 

  

decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities contract loss provisions recorded as of august 31 2009 and 2008 are immaterial 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

  

revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 510 more work days than our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset planned use of the tax asset tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense in accordance with fin 48 a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

  

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

our five reportable operating segments in fiscal 2009 were our operating groups which were communications  high tech financial services products public service and resources for presentation purposes all discussions and operating group financial results relating to periods through the end of our 2009 fiscal year on august 31 2009 refer to the historical standalone public service operating group exclusive of the payer and provider components of the health  life sciences industry group which were included in our products operating group in fiscal 2009 operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

  

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

net revenues 

since january 2009 our business has been affected by the continuing global economic downturn many clients have delayed new large consulting commitments have slowed the pace of ongoing projects and have reduced requests for incremental projects in addition in response to clients seeking to reduce 

  

operating costs with requests for price concessions where practicable we have shifted to lowercost resources at a reduced price level as a result most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 consulting revenues declined 12 in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 primarily due to declines in communications  high tech of 26 products of 22 financial services of 12 and resources of 5 partially offset by local currency growth in public service of 19 in addition most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 in the fourth quarter outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as growth in products of 9 resources of 5 and public service of 2 was offset by declines in financial services of 8 and communications  high tech of 2

the increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a bad debt provision of 75 million or 03 of net revenues this provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables in light of global economic conditions particularly from clients in highrisk industries or with potential liquidity issues 

restructuring and reorganization costs net 

we recorded restructuring costs of 253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 these costs included 111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 142 million related to realignment of our workforce primarily at the seniorexecutive level to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future

operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs nongaap 

 

  

  

 while we have seen our net revenues contract due to both the current global economic downturn and significant foreignexchange rate fluctuations we have improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability particularly in our outsourcing business this improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues in addition each operating group recorded a portion of the 75 million bad debt provision and a portion of the 253 million restructuring cost see “—general and administrative costs” and “—restructuring and reorganization costs net” during fiscal 2009 we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreignexchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues the operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 exclusive of foreignexchange rate bad debt provision and restructuring impacts 

 

  

  

  

  

   

interest income 

interest income was 50 million in fiscal 2009 a decrease of 65 million or 56 from fiscal 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 276 and 293 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prioryear tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008

minority interest was 348 million in fiscal 2009 a decrease of 157 million or 31 from fiscal 2008 the change was due to a 259 million decrease in income before minority interest and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17 for fiscal 2009 from 22 for fiscal 2008 

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 244 for fiscal 2009 compared with 265 for fiscal 2008 the 021 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of 253 million in pretax restructuring costs which reduced earnings per share by 024 absent the restructuring costs earnings per share increased 003 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the following increases of 011 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency 011 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and 006 from a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by decreases of 020 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared with fiscal 2008 and 005 from other items including reorganization benefits and nonoperating items for information regarding our earnings per share calculations see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 293 and 342 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2008 primarily as a result of benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities which reduced the rate by 39 nonus research and development tax credits which reduced the rate by 13 and changes in the geographic distribution of income these benefits were offset by expenses related to tax rate changes enacted during fiscal 2008 which reduced the value of our deferred tax assets fiscal 2007 included a reduction in the effective tax rate of 08 recorded as a result of a nonrecurring benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets

earnings per share 

diluted earnings per share were 265 in fiscal 2008 compared with 197 in fiscal 2007 the 068 increase in our earnings per share was primarily the result of the following 025 from strong 

  

growth in revenues and operating income in local currency 019 from a lower effective tax rate and 012 from lower weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by 002 from lower nonoperating income in addition favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 014 of the increase for information regarding our earnings per share calculation see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves we may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

  

  

  

 as of august 31 2009 cash and cash equivalents was 4542 million compared with 3603 million as of august 31 2008 an increase of 939 million cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 

 

  

 operating activities the 357 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues partially offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2008 also reflected a payment of 143 million to settle tax audits related to reorganization liabilities 

investing activities the 79 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in spending on business acquisitions and lower spending on property and equipment partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of availableforsale investments 

financing activities the 311 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of common shares partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid for additional information see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities 

as of august 31 2009 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 

 

  

  

  

 under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 172 million and 169 million of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition we had total outstanding debt of 1 million and 3 million as of august 31 2009 and 2008

obligations and commitments 

as of august 31 2009 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters these arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights 

typically we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement the limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time andor amount 

for arrangements with unspecified limitations we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement 

  

to date we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above for further discussion of these transactions see note 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements

on september 1 2008 we adopted the provisions of sfas 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in accordance with fasb staff position 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” we elected to defer the adoption of the provisions of sfas 157 for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities such assets and liabilities which include our deferred contract costs property and equipment net and goodwill will be subject to the provisions of sfas 157 on september 1 2009 we are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets may have on our consolidated financial statements for additional information see note 8 fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

effective september 1 2008 we adopted the yearend measurement date provision of sfas 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132r ” using an approach generally known as the “one measurement approach” the adoption of the provision had the following impact on our consolidated balance sheet decreased retained earnings by 53 million decreased accumulated other comprehensive loss income by 03 million decreased other noncurrent assets by 27 million and increased retirement obligation by 29 million 

on march 1 2009 we adopted sfas 165 “subsequent events” “sfas 165” which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued sfas 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date the adoption of sfas 165 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” which is a revision of sfas 141 “business combinations” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed 

  

and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase expensing acquisition related costs as incurred and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we will adopt the provisions of sfas 141r for acquisitions that occur on or after september 1 2009 the impact of sfas 141r on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the size and nature of any acquisitions on or after september 1 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso us dollaraustralian dollar us dollarswiss franc us dollarbrazilian real us dollarjapanese yen and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso and uk poundindian rupee which typically have maturities not exceeding three years — are intended to partially offset the impact of currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by accenture’s global delivery network 

for designated cash flow hedges gains losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2009 it is anticipated that 8 million of the net loss net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 180 million and 146 million as of august 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

interest rate risk 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2009 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 

 

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

 

risks that relate to our business 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity 

 

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve a severe andor prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients’ financial condition and the levels of business activity of our clients and the industries we serve this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

 

our results of operations could be negatively affected if we cannot expand and develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand 

 

our success depends on our ability to develop and implement consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry developments and client needs we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace implementing new services or solutions for our clients may entail more risk than supplying existing offerings also services solutions and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain or successfully deliver client work 

 

the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively 

 

the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings including 

 

 22 

 

  

in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide 

 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals additionally some of our competitors particularly those located in regions with lower costs of doing business may be able to provide services and solutions at lower cost or on more favorable terms than we can particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are accenture clients if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices our results of operations may suffer 

 

in addition we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers these mergers may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers this vertical integration may result in greater convergence among previously separate technology functions or reduced access to products and may adversely affect our competitive position 

 

our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment 

 

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

 23 

  

  

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government agency involved but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities additionally because of their visibility and political nature government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation either of these could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

 

our business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services 

 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract new work from our base of existing clients at times on a sole source basis our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

 

we could be subject to liabilities if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner cannot deliver their project contributions on time or at all 

 

large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to meet their project obligations in a timely manner as well as on our effective oversight of their performance the quality of our services and solutions could suffer if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner do not deliver their products and services in accordance with project requirements in addition certain work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of these structures require us to assume responsibility to the client for the performance of third parties whom we do not control for a discussion of our indemnification obligations under our client agreements see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 

operations—offbalance sheet arrangements” if our subcontractors or these third parties fail to deliver their contributions on time or at all if their contributions do not meet project requirements or require us to incur unanticipated costs to meet these requirements or if we are unable to obtain reimbursement for liabilities of third parties that we have assumed then our ability to perform could be adversely affected and we might be subject to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues profitability or cash flow 

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

 

our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive projectbyproject basis although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our consulting contracts we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these shorterduration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice and without significant penalty longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract additionally large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work 

 

terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected 

 

outsourcing services are a significant part of our business and subject us to operational and financial risk 

 

we earned approximately 40 of our net revenues in fiscal 2008 from our outsourcing services this portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting technology and systems integration services our outsourcing services often involve taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses in some cases we may deliver those services using client personnel and thirdparty contracts that are transferred to us occasionally however we assume responsibility for delivering our services using client personnel or client subcontractors who are not transferred to us and we therefore have less ability to fully control their work and efforts in addition we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients’ businesses that are transferred to us 

 

this type of work also presents financial risks to us outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly during the first year of the contract this could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time furthermore we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques sometimes assisted by thirdparty advisors 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

 26 

 

in recent periods we have maintained a utilization rate that is high by our historical standards there are no assurances this will be our utilization rate in future periods additionally we may not achieve a utilization rate that is optimal for us if our utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition if our utilization rate is too low our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our solutions and services 

 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to clients or if our subcontractors dispute the terms of our agreements with them we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our offshore competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standardized in the marketplace we may find ourselves committed to providing services that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability if we cannot meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

 

if our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions depending on the particular contract these include timeandmaterials pricing fixedprice pricing and contracts with features of both of these pricing models our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we could face greater risk when pricing our outsourcing contracts as many of our outsourcing projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations utilizing workforces with different skillsets and competencies and geographically distributed service centers furthermore on outsourcing work we occasionally hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing contract there is a risk that we will underprice our contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

 

many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that links some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets this could increase the variability of our revenues and margins 

 

many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could reduce our fees 

under the contracts delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms additionally we have a number of contracts many of which are outsourcing contracts in which a portion of our fees or incentives depends on factors such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

 

our alliance relationships may not be successful 

 

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own see “business—alliances” as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors loss of or limitations on our relationships with them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

 

we have offices and operations in 52 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 120 countries in fiscal 2008 approximately 42 of our net revenues were attributable to the americas region 49 were attributable to the europe middle east and africa region “emea” and 9 were attributable to the asia pacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world in tandem with professionals resident in other countries located in more than 50 delivery centers if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our operating results in us dollars a significant percentage of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us 

 

 28 

  

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results acts of terrorist violence armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information we are also required at times to manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies our clients may request that we provide an audit of control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business because we provide services to clients in more than 120 countries we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs immigration internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation anticompetition data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

 

legislation related to certain nonus corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture however additional legislative proposals remain under consideration in various legislatures which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 

 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act which prohibits giving or offering to give anything of value with the intent to influence the awarding of government contracts although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from us federal procurement contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs 

 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability as the continuation of pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities we must continuously improve our management of costs our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs might not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing our longterm costreduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in costs for service delivery and infrastructure rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and competency workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategies for growth we might not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces control our costs or improve our efficiency and our profitability could be negatively affected 

if we are unable to attract retain and motivate employees or efficiently utilize their skills we might not be able to compete effectively and will not be able to grow our business 

 

our success and ability to grow are dependent in large part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and grow our business competition for skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority to address this competition we may need to further adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profit margins we are particularly dependent on the skills of our senior executives and if we are not able to successfully retain and motivate our senior executives and experienced managers our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized at the same time the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects and global delivery centers the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require or that it will prove difficult to retain them in a competitive labor market if we are unable to hire and retain talented employees with the skills and in the locations we require we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs if we need to reassign personnel from other areas or employ subcontractors it could increase our costs and adversely affect our profit margins if we are not successful at retaining and motivating our senior executives attracting and retaining other qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of our business or utilizing our people effectively then our ability to compete for new work and successfully complete existing work for our clients could be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients which totaled 156 million at august 31 2008 we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have 

infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

 

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success 

 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we help create which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

 

new tax legislation or interpretations could lead to an increase in our tax burden 

 

new tax legislation regulations or other interpretations could materially increase our tax expense in 2004 the united states congress enacted the american jobs creation act of 2004 or the “ajca” which enacted an internal revenue code provision that treats a nonus company that undertook an expatriation transaction as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes other similar proposals have been made from time to time we do not believe the 2004 legislation applies to accenture however future legislative developments or adverse interpretations related to this legislation may materially increase our tax expense we are not able to predict with certainty the impact of new legislation or whether a tax authority will challenge our interpretation of this or other tax legislation 

 

negative publicity related to bermuda companies could affect our relationships with our clients 

 

from time to time there has been negative publicity related to companies incorporated in bermuda one frequent criticism is that certain us companies undertook expatriation transactions to 

offshore jurisdictions such as bermuda to improperly avoid us taxes or to create an unfair competitive advantage over us companies although incorporated in bermuda accenture did not undertake an expatriation transaction nonetheless such negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of a negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our clients receiving negative media attention from doing business with us 

 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size and expansion we might be unable to achieve our business objectives 

 

since 2001 we have more than doubled the size of our workforce so that as of august 31 2008 we had more than 186000 employees located in more than 200 cities in 52 countries increasingly our expansion is taking place outside of the united states and europe with particular growth in our locations in india and the philippines our size presents significant management and organizational challenges and these issues may become more pronounced as we continue our expansion it takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires as a result it could become increasingly difficult to maintain common standards across an expanding enterprise or to effectively institutionalize our knowhow continued growth may also make it increasingly difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values strategies and goals finally the size and scope of our operations increases the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our large and expanding enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

 

we may not be successful at identifying acquiring or integrating other businesses or technologies 

 

we expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities however there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired financial or operating results furthermore we face numerous risks in integrating any businesses we might acquire we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or further improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of 

larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about accenture even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

 

risks that relate to ownership of our class a common shares 

 

the share price of accenture ltd class a common shares could be adversely affected from time to time by sales or the anticipation of future sales of class a common shares held by our employees and former employees 

 

our employees and former employees continue to hold significant amounts of equity in accenture in the form of accenture ltd class a common shares restricted share units and options and shares in our subsidiaries most of which are exchangeable or redeemable for accenture ltd class a common shares the majority of these holdings are or may become freely tradable in the marketplace as described below 

 

our current and former employees hold a large number of shares that will become freely tradable in the periods before and after july 24 2009 

 

at the time of our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 many of our senior executives received a substantial number of accenture ltd class a common shares andor securities that may be exercisable redeemable or exchangeable for accenture ltd class a common shares or pursuant to which accenture ltd class a common shares may be delivered to such senior executives those shares have generally been subject to transfer restrictions that lapse with the passage of time through july 24 2009 in 2007 we eliminated a requirement that active employees hold at least 25 of these shares at all times during their employment in addition we have also enacted a number of graduated waivers of transfer restrictions to permit our current and former senior executives to transfer or sell into the marketplace a portion of these shares significantly earlier than would have been the case in the past as a result there are a substantial number of shares previously subject to transfer restrictions that are currently available for sale and more will become available through july 2009 as a result there is a risk that sales of these shares could have an adverse effect on our share price for a complete description of the transfer restrictions and waivers see “business—organizational structure—restrictions on transfer of certain accenture shares” 

our senior executive trading policy might not be effective at limiting the number of shares sold 

 

we maintain a senior executive trading policy that provides among other things that covered shares held by actively employed senior executives will be subject to companyimposed quarterly trading guidelines see “business—organizational structure—restrictions on transfer of certain accenture shares—senior executive trading policy” these guidelines which can be adjusted by management are not legal or contractual restrictions however and there is a risk that the internal sanctions available to us might not adequately dissuade individual employees from attempting transfers in excess of the amounts permitted under the policy additionally there is a risk that this policy creates an adverse incentive for some senior executives to retire or to terminate their employment in order to sell unrestricted shares that would otherwise be governed by these quarterly trading guidelines this could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain talented and experienced senior executives 

 

the sale of shares issued under our 2001 share incentive plan could have an adverse effect on our share price 

 

in addition to the covered shares described above as of october 1 2008 a total of 54159824 accenture ltd class a common shares underlying restricted share units were scheduled to be delivered during the calendar years indicated below 

 

 

 

furthermore as of october 1 2008 a total of 33732489 accenture ltd class a common shares were issuable pursuant to options that are currently exercisable upon delivery of restricted stock or exercise of employee stock options under our 2001 share incentive plan our employees or former employees may choose to sell a significant number of our shares in open market transactions there is a risk that this could put additional downward pressure on the price of accenture ltd class a common stock 

 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate including in response to variability in revenues operating results and profitability and as a result our share price could be difficult to predict 

 

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 

 35 

 

our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our revenues operating results and profitability to vary include 

 

  

as a result of any of these factors our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be adversely affected 

 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are registered in bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states as a result it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states 

 

we are organized under the laws of bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of us federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where we have assets in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets 

 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders 

 

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his conduct and the loss suffered 

we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all if we raise equity capital it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us 

 

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business we andor our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world we do not expect that any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

as previously reported in september 2007 the state of connecticut filed an action in state superior court in hartford against accenture arising out of an alleged data security breach the action arose in connection with work we undertook for the state of connecticut’s office of the comptroller the “corect project” during which accenture properly came into the possession of confidential information including personally identifiable information concerning connecticut citizens the complaint alleges that some of the information was subsequently placed on a server maintained by the state of ohio by accenture employees who were transferred from the corect project to a similar project for the state of ohio and that a backup tape from the ohio server containing some of the information was stolen in june 2007 from an ohio state employee the state of connecticut claims that accenture breached its contract with the connecticut comptroller’s office and also asserts negligence and the unauthorized taking of information by accenture the complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages including restitution of some unspecified portion of the amount paid to accenture pursuant to the corect project contract during the investigation of this matter it was discovered that confidential information belonging to several other accenture clients appeared on the ohio server and 

accenture has notified the affected clients although these events represent a breach of accenture’s internal policies on data security we have no evidence that any individual has been harmed as a result accenture is committed to maintaining the security of its clients’ data and has conducted an internal investigation to ensure the integrity of all confidential data including personally identifiable information in its possession accenture is continuing to take proactive remedial measures to reinforce adherence to its data protection policies in addition to the connecticut suit it is possible that other affected parties could bring similar lawsuits or proceedings we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

as previously reported on april 12 2007 the us department of justice the “doj” intervened in a civil “qui tam” action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas against accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries the complaint alleges that in connection with work we undertook for the us federal government we received payments resale revenue or other benefits as a result of alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the us government andor applicable law or regulations similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry the total amount of the payments resale revenue and other benefits alleged in the complaint is 32 million the suit alleges that these amounts were not disclosed to the government in violation of the federal false claims act and the antikickback act among other statutes the doj complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits the suit could lead to other related proceedings by various agencies of the us government including potential suspension or debarment proceedings we intend to defend this matter vigorously and do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

as previously reported in july 2003 we became aware of an incident of possible noncompliance with the foreign corrupt practices act andor with accenture’s internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in the middle east in 2003 we voluntarily reported the incident to the appropriate authorities in the united states promptly after its discovery shortly thereafter the sec advised us it would be undertaking an informal investigation of this incident and the doj indicated it would also conduct a review since that time there have been no further developments we do not believe that this incident will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

overview 

 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions generally including macroeconomic conditions we are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us a severe andor prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients’ financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 

 

our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 

 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

 

revenues before reimbursements “net revenues” for fiscal 2008 were 2339 billion compared with 1970 billion for fiscal 2007 an increase of 19 in us dollars and 11 in local currency net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were 600 billion compared with 511 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 an increase of 17 in us dollars and 10 in local currency 

 

consulting net revenues for fiscal 2008 were 1412 billion compared with 1186 billion for fiscal 2007 an increase of 19 in us dollars and 11 in local currency for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 consulting net revenues were 361 billion compared with 304 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 an increase of 19 in us dollars and 11 in local currency 

 

outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2008 were 927 billion compared with 784 billion for fiscal 2007 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 11 in local currency outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were 239 billion compared with 207 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 an increase of 15 in us dollars and 9 in local currency outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year longterm relationships with many of our 

clients continue to contribute to our success in growing our outsourcing business longterm complex outsourcing contracts including their consulting components require ongoing review of their terms and scope of work in light of our clients’ evolving business needs and our performance expectations should the size or number of modifications to these arrangements increase as our business continues to grow and these contracts evolve we may experience increased variability in expected cash flows revenues and profitability 

 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations during the majority of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 the us dollar weakened against many currencies resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues operating expenses and operating income however in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 the us dollar began to strengthen against many currencies in the future if the us dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies our revenue growth in us dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency in the future if the us dollar weakens against other currencies our revenue growth in us dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency 

 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable work utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 84 down slightly from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and in the range we expect utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was also approximately 84 sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek to manage as a percentage of revenues at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prioryear periods operating expenses also include reorganization costs and benefits which may vary substantially from year to year 

 

gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the three months and year ended august 31 2008 were 317 and 307 respectively compared with 312 and 307 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2007 

 

our costmanagement strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and identifying costmanagement initiatives a primary element of these strategies is to aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs to meet the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 

 

our headcount increased to more than 186000 as of august 31 2008 compared with approximately 170000 as of august 31 2007 annualized attrition excluding involuntary terminations for the three months and year ended august 31 2008 was 15 and 16 respectively compared with 18 for the three months and year ended august 31 2007 we monitor our current and projected future demands and recruit new employees as needed to balance our mix of skills and resources to meet that demand to replace departing employees and to expand our global sourcing approach which includes our global delivery network and other capabilities around the world from time to time we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future 

we also use managed attrition as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in addition compensation increases for fiscal 2008 which for the majority of our personnel were effective september 1 2007 were higher than in prior fiscal years as in prior fiscal years we have adjusted and expect to continue to adjust pricing with the objective of recovering these increases our margins and ability to grow our business could be adversely affected if we do not continue to manage headcount and attrition recover increases in compensation andor effectively assimilate and utilize large numbers of new employees 

 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 177 for fiscal 2008 compared with 179 for fiscal 2007 the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to strong revenue growth and our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues 

 

operating income was 785 million or 131 as a percentage of net revenues for the three months ended august 31 2008 compared with 642 million or 126 for the three months ended august 31 2007 operating income was 3012 million or 129 as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended august 31 2008 compared with 2493 or 127 for the year ended august 31 2007 

 

our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations on revenues and costs which have been favorable in fiscal 2008 and 2007 most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues where practical we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and our hedging programs we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for revenues for more information on our hedging programs see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

 

from time to time we purchase accenture shares through our openmarket purchase program and also purchase and redeem accenture shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees during the year ended august 31 2008 we purchased 608 million of our shares for 2261 million this included 668 million for purchases of 190 million accenture ltd class a common shares and 1593 million for redemptions and purchases of 418 million accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees 

 

bookings and backlog 

 

new contract bookings for the three months ended august 31 2008 were 767 billion with consulting bookings of 363 billion and outsourcing bookings of 404 billion new contract bookings for the year ended august 31 2008 were 2679 billion with consulting bookings of 1477 billion and outsourcing bookings of 1202 billion 

 

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending on the timing of the signing of a small number of large contracts information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and additions to existing contracts subsequent cancellations extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously 

reported new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 

 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition income taxes and defined benefit pension plans 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimated revenues for applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities contract loss provisions recorded as of august 31 2008 and 2007 are immaterial 

 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial 

statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services generally deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

 

revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to emerging issues task force issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value 

and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since we typically have approximately 5 to 10 percent more work days in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

 

net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements include billings for travel and other outofpocket expenses and thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales in addition reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses we report revenues net of any revenuebased taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions 

 

income taxes 

 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense in accordance with fin 48 a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 

 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax benefits when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged we evaluate these uncertain tax benefits each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax benefits are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax 

authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax benefits 

 

defined benefit pension plans 

 

in the united states and certain other countries we maintain and administer defined benefit pension plans the annual cost of these plans can be significantly affected by changes in assumptions and differences between expected and actual experience 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires companies to prospectively recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas no 158 gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” that have not yet been recognized through pension expense will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax until they are amortized as a component of net periodic pensionpostretirement benefits expense additionally sfas no 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their yearend balance sheet date we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions as of august 31 2007 and will adopt the yearend measurement date provision as of august 31 2009 

 

the adoption of sfas no 158 affected the august 31 2007 consolidated balance sheet as follows increase in assets of 2 million decrease in liabilities of 24 million and increase in shareholders’ equity of 26 million for additional information refer to note 11 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we utilize actuarial methods required by sfas no 87 to account for our defined benefit pension plans the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans two of the most significant assumptions are the discount rates and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in making these assumptions we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations the assumptions assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension expense are determined as of june 30 or august 31 for our us and nonus benefit plans 

 

key weightedaverage assumptions used to determine annual pension expense are as follows 

 

 

discount rate 

 

the discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation our methodology for selecting the discount rate for our us plans is to match the plans’ cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity our discount rate assumption for our nonus plans primarily reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments the discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year our estimated us pension expense for fiscal 2009 reflects a 50 basis point increase in our discount rate while our nonus estimated pension expense for fiscal 2009 reflects a 33 basis point increase in our discount rate these changes in discount rate will decrease estimated pension expense in fiscal 2009 by approximately 150 million 

 

a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our annual pension expense by 51 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by 66 million 

 

expected return on plan assets 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns on pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio a 750 expected return on plan assets assumption was used for both fiscal 2009 and 2008 for our us plans while the expected return on plan assets assumptions for our nonus plans were 586 and 597 in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

a 25 basis point change in our return on plan assets would change our annual pension expense by 36 million 

 

us generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur for example while the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year these differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time negative market returns occurred for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 causing actual pension plan asset returns to be lower than our expected returns 

 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services products public service known as “government” prior to september 1 2007 and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group we also report net revenues by two types of work consulting and outsourcing which represent the services sold by our operating groups consulting net revenues which include management and technology consulting and systems integration services reflect a finite distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition run andor manage operations of client systems or business functions 

from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

 

while we provide discussion about our results of operations below we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume instead our measures of volume and price are extremely complex as each of our services contracts is unique reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided the skills required and outcome sought as well as estimated cost risk contract terms and other factors

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves we may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

 64 

 

  

as of august 31 2008 cash and cash equivalents of 3603 million combined with 23 million of liquid fixedincome securities that are classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheet totaled 3626 million compared with 3614 million as of august 31 2007 an increase of 12 million 

 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

  

operating activities the 172 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income partially offset by an increase in net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues and other changes in operating assets and liabilities 

 

investing activities the 26 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of availableforsale securities and lower spending on property and equipment driven by effective space management within the global delivery network partially offset by increased spending on business acquisitions for additional information regarding our business acquisitions see note 6 business combinations and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

financing activities the 34 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid for additional information see note 14 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities 

 

as of august 31 2008 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 

 

 

 

  

under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 169 million and 164 million of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition we had no other shortterm borrowings as of august 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

we also had total outstanding debt of 3 million and 25 million as of august 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the outstanding debt as of august 31 2007 was primarily incurred in conjunction with the purchase of accenture hr services 

 

share purchases and redemptions 

 

the board of directors of accenture ltd has authorized funding for our publicly announced openmarket share purchase program for acquiring accenture ltd class a common shares and for purchases and redemptions of accenture ltd class a common shares accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees 

a summary of our share purchase activity for cash during the year ended august 31 2008 is as follows

senior executive ownership requirements 

 

to ensure that senior executives continue to maintain equity ownership levels that accenture considers meaningful we require current senior executives to comply with the accenture senior executive equity ownership policy this policy requires senior executives to own accenture equity valued at a multiple ranging from 1  2 to 6 of their base compensation determined by their position level 

 

senior executive trading policy 

 

we have a senior executive trading policy applicable to our senior executives that provides among other things that covered shares held by actively employed senior executives will be subject to companyimposed quarterly trading guidelines we set allocation limits of unrestricted covered shares based on a composite average weekly volume of trading in accenture ltd class a common shares 

these guidelines allow us to manage the total number of shares redeemed sold or otherwise transferred by our senior executives in any calendar quarter the guidelines which can be adjusted by management are not legal or contractual restrictions however and there is a risk that the internal sanctions available to us might not adequately dissuade individual employees from attempting transfers in excess of the amounts permitted under the policy the senior executive trading policy also prohibits senior executives from trading in any accenture equity during any companydesignated blackout period 

 

subsequent development 

 

on september 24 2008 accenture ltd declared a cash dividend of 050 per share on our class a common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 10 2008 accenture ltd will cause accenture sca to declare a cash dividend of 050 per share on its class i common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 7 2008 both dividends are payable on november 17 2008

harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold licensed or certain intellectual property rights and other matters payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract furthermore our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement historically we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate as of august 31 2008 we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

 

certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year these hedges—primarily us dollarindian rupee us dollareuro us dollarswiss franc us dollaryen and us dollarnorwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other expense net in the consolidated income statement additionally we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery network and typically have maturities not exceeding three years these hedges—us dollarindian rupee us dollarphilippine peso and uk poundindian rupee—are intended to partially offset the impact of currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by accenture’s global delivery network 

 

for designated cash flow hedges gains losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as cost of services as of august 31 2008 it is anticipated that 22 million of the net gains net of tax currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into cost of services within the next 12 months 

 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity 

analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure a 10 change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar or other base currency of the hedge if not a us dollar hedge with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately 146 million and 9 million as of august 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2008 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

 

equity price risk 

 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001 we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners in connection with our transition to a corporate structure our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for accenture ltd class a common shares or in the case of partners in certain countries accenture sca class i common shares or exchangeable shares issued by accenture canada holdings inc an indirect subsidiary of accenture sca generally partners who received accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of accenture ltd class x common shares which entitle their holders to vote at accenture ltd shareholder meetings but do not carry any economic rights 

 

in fiscal 2005 accenture developed and announced a new broader career model for its highestlevel executives that recognizes the diversity of roles and responsibilities demonstrated by these employees this new career framework replaced the internal use of the “partner” title with the more comprehensive “senior executive” title and applies the “senior executive” title to more than 4300 of our highestlevel employees including those employees previously referred to as partners however for proper context we continue to use the term “partner” in this report to refer to these persons in certain situations related to our reorganization and the period prior to our incorporation

each class a common share and each class x common share of accenture ltd entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of accenture ltd a holder of a class x common share is not however entitled to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of accenture ltd

the amendments to the class ii common shares the creation of class iii common shares and all lettered subseries of that class and the reclassification of all class i common shares held or to be held by accenture ltd and its subsidiaries have no effect on the computation of accenture ltd’s earnings per share 

 

accenture sca class ii common shares and class iii common shares or any lettered subseries of that class are not entitled to any cash dividends if the board of directors of accenture ltd authorizes the payment of a cash dividend on accenture ltd’s class a common shares accenture ltd as general partner of accenture sca will cause accenture sca to redeem class ii common shares and class iii common shares that accenture ltd holds to obtain cash needed to pay dividends on its class a common shares at any time that accenture sca pays a cash dividend on its class i common shares new class ii common shares and class iii common shares will be issued to the existing holders of class ii common shares and class iii common shares in each case having an aggregate value of the amount of any cash dividends that the holders of those class ii or class iii common shares would have received had they ratably participated in the cash dividend paid on the class i common shares

restrictions on the transfer of certain accenture shares 

 

accenture ltd byelaws 

 

covered person transfer restrictions accenture ltd’s byelaws contain transfer restrictions that apply to certain accenture current and former senior executives who hold accenture ltd class a common shares we refer to these persons as “covered persons” the accenture ltd shares covered by the transfer restrictions generally include any accenture ltd class a common shares beneficially owned by a senior executive at the time in question and also as of or prior to the initial public offering of the accenture ltd class a common shares in july 2001 we refer to the shares covered by these transfer restrictions as “covered shares” 

  current senior executives historically the transfer restrictions applicable to covered shares lapsed with the passage of time on an annual basis until july 24 2009 but were subject to a requirement that covered persons continue to maintain beneficial ownership of at least 25 of their covered shares as long as they remain employed by accenture even after july 24 2009 this was referred to as the “25 minimum holding requirement” 

 

effective in july 2007 the board of directors of accenture ltd granted a waiver under the byelaws that is applicable to covered persons who are active accenture employees the byelaws of accenture ltd permit certain waivers with respect to the transfer restrictions as described below under “—waivers and adjustments” this waiver eliminated the 25 minimum holding requirement and permits covered shares that would otherwise not have become free for transfer until the later of july 24 2009 or the termination of the employee’s employment with accenture to become transferable on a phasedin schedule as described below 

 

the effect of this waiver has been to accelerate the timeframe related to the previous transfer restrictions applicable to covered persons who are active employees the transfer restrictions are being released in equal quarterly installments with restrictions on oneninth of the covered shares subject to the 25 minimum holding requirement being released each quarter over a ninequarter period which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the rationale for the waiver was to decrease the large number of shares whose transfer restrictions would otherwise lapse on july 24 2009 or upon the termination of our senior executives’ employment and to remove an incentive for senior executives to resign or retire from accenture after july 24 2009 in order to access shares that would have been covered by the 25 minimum holding requirement absent this waiver by lifting this restriction in stages on an accelerated basis we have designed the waiver to limit the potential market impact of having a large number of shares whose transfer restrictions lapse on a single date in july 2009 

 

the following table shows the total number of covered shares of accenture ltd held by active employees scheduled to be released from transfer restrictions each quarter pursuant to the remaining transfer restrictions this table reflects the adoption of the phasedin quarterly waiver described above starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and assumes that all covered persons who are active employees as of october 1 2007 remain actively employed by accenture through june 1 2009 the actual number of additional covered shares that become available for transfer as a result of the waiver will be reduced depending on the number of covered persons who cease to be employed prior to june 1 2009 

 

 

 

former senior executives the waiver described above did not affect the transfer restrictions that continue to apply to retired and resigned covered persons accordingly covered persons who are no 

  longer employed by accenture will continue to be able to transfer a percentage of the covered shares received by them on or prior to july 24 2001 and owned by them as set forth in the following table

notwithstanding the transfer restrictions described in this summary accenture ltd class x common shares may not be transferred at any time except upon the death of a holder of class x common shares or with the consent of accenture ltd 

  accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by covered persons are also subject to the transfer restrictions in accenture ltd’s byelaws

in july 2005 we implemented a senior executive trading policy applicable to our senior executives that provides among other things that covered shares held by actively employed senior executives will be subject to companyimposed quarterly trading guidelines we set allocation limits of unrestricted covered shares based on a composite average weekly volume of trading in accenture ltd class a common shares these guidelines allow us to manage the total number of shares redeemed sold or otherwise transferred by our senior executives in any calendar quarter the policy guidelines which can be adjusted by management are not legal or contractual restrictions however and there is a risk that the internal sanctions available to us might not adequately dissuade individual employees from attempting transfers in excess of the amounts permitted under the policy the senior executive trading policy also prohibits senior executives from trading in any accenture equity during any companydesignated blackout period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 

 

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

 

risks that relate to our business 

 

  

our success depends on our ability to develop and implement consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry developments and client needs we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace also services solutions and technologies offered by current or future 

  competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully deliver client work 

 

  

the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings including 

 

  

in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide 

 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing or other resources than we do and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals additionally some of our competitors particularly those located in regions with lower costs of doing business may be able to provide services and solutions at lower cost or on more favorable terms than we can particularly in the outsourcing and systems integration markets there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer including to companies that are accenture clients if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices our results of operations may suffer 

 

in addition we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers these mergers may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers this vertical integration may result in greater convergence among previously separate technology functions or reduced access to products and may adversely affect our competitive position 

 

  

global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve a significant or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients’ financial condition and the levels of business activity of our clients and the industries we serve this may reduce our clients’ demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive 

  advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

 

  

our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government agency involved but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities additionally because of their visibility and political nature government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation either of these could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

    

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract new work from our base of existing clients at times on a sole source basis our business model also depends on relationships our senior executives develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

 

  

large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to meet their project obligations in a timely manner the quality of our services and solutions could suffer if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner do not deliver their products and services in accordance with project requirements in addition certain work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of these structures require us to assume responsibility to the client for the performance of third parties whom we do not control for a discussion of our indemnification obligations under our client agreements see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—offbalance sheet arrangements” if our subcontractors or these third parties fail to deliver their contributions on time or at all if their contributions do not meet project requirements or if we are unable to obtain reimbursement for liabilities of third parties that we have assumed our ability to perform could be adversely affected and we might be subject to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues profitability or cash flow 

 

  

our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive projectbyproject basis although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our contracts we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these shorterduration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice and without significant penalty longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract additionally large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work 

  terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected 

 

  

we earned approximately 40 of our revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2007 from our outsourcing services this portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting technology and systems integration services in many cases we take over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses and client personnel and contracts are sometimes transferred to us in some cases this could mean that we assume responsibility for portions of our clients’ personnel staffing overhead and similar needs but might not have full ability to control the work and efforts of client personnel or their subcontractors in addition we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients’ businesses that are transferred to us 

 

this type of work also presents financial risks to us outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly during the first year of the contract this could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts which might not be offset by improved performance on contracts in our portfolio that we have been operating for a longer time in addition we have experienced a trend toward outsourcing agreements that are of shorter duration and therefore of smaller initial total contract value than they have been in the past furthermore we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques sometimes assisted by thirdparty advisors 

 

  

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

  

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

 26 

   

  

  

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

in recent periods we have maintained a utilization rate that is high by our historical standards there are no assurances this will be our utilization rate in future periods additionally we may not achieve a utilization rate that is optimal for us if our utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition if the utilization rate for our professionals were to decline our profit margin and profitability could suffer 

 

  

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to clients or if our subcontractors dispute the terms of our agreements with them we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines we may find ourselves committed to providing services that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability if we cannot meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

    

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions depending on the particular contract these include timeandmaterials pricing fixedprice pricing and contracts with features of both of these pricing models our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we could face greater risk when pricing our outsourcing contracts as many of our outsourcing projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations utilizing workforces with different skillsets and competencies and geographically distributed service centers furthermore on outsourcing work we occasionally hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing contract there is a risk that we will underprice our contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

 

  

many of our contracts include performance clauses that require us to achieve agreedupon performance standards or milestones if we fail to satisfy these measures it could reduce our fees under the contracts delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms additionally we have an increasing number of contracts many of which are outsourcing contracts where a portion of our fees or incentives depends on factors such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and often depend in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts we estimate that a majority of our contracts include terms that condition some or all of our fees on the achievement of contractually defined goals 

 

  

we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own see “business—alliances” as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors loss of or limitations on our relationships with them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

we have offices and operations in 49 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 75 countries in fiscal 2007 approximately 43 of our revenues before reimbursements were attributable to the americas region 48 were attributable to the europe middle east and africa 

  region “emea” and 9 were attributable to the asia pacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world in tandem with professionals resident in other countries located in more than 40 delivery centers if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our operating results in us dollars a significant percentage of our revenues before reimbursements is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us 

 

  

international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results acts of terrorist violence—such as those of recent years in the united states spain and england—armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities 

  as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information we are also required at times to manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies our clients may request that we provide an audit of control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business because we provide services to clients in more than 75 countries we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs immigration internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

 

legislation related to certain nonus corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture however additional legislative proposals remain under consideration in various legislatures which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our 

  eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 

 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act which prohibits giving anything of value with the intent to influence the awarding of government contracts although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from us federal procurement contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

  

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability as the continuation of pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities we must continuously improve our management of costs our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs might not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing our longterm costreduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in costs for service delivery and infrastructure rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and competency workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategies for growth we might not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces control our costs or improve our efficiency despite increased cost savings we could experience erosion of operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements if current pricing pressures accelerate 

 

  

our success and ability to grow are dependent in large part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and grow our business competition for skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority to address this competition we may need to further adjust our compensation practices which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profit margins we are particularly dependent on the skills of our senior executives and if we are not able to successfully retain and motivate our senior executives and experienced managers our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized at the same time the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects and global delivery centers the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require or that it will prove difficult to retain them in a competitive labor market if we are unable to hire and retain talented employees with the skills and in the locations we require we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs if we need to reassign personnel from other areas or employ subcontractors it could increase our 

  costs and adversely affect our profit margins if we are not successful at retaining and motivating our senior executives attracting and retaining other qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of our business or utilizing our people effectively then our ability to compete for new work and successfully complete existing work for our clients could be adversely affected 

 

  

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients which totaled 235 million at august 31 2007 we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients in addition recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected although we have recently been successful in timely collection of client balances if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

  

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions historically in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

 

we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

  

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights the steps we take in this regard 

  might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

 

depending on the circumstances we might grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in which case we would seek to crosslicense the use of the intellectual property 

 

however in certain situations we might forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create which might limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

 

  

in 2004 the united states congress enacted legislation relating to the tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions we do not believe this legislation applies to accenture however we are not able to predict with certainty whether the us internal revenue service will challenge our interpretation of the legislation nor are we able to predict with certainty the impact of regulations or other interpretations that might be issued related to this legislation future developments or the finalization of regulations or interpretations could materially increase our tax expense 

 

in addition there have been from time to time negative comments in the media regarding companies incorporated in bermuda this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of a negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our clients receiving negative media attention from doing business with us 

 

  

since 2001 we have more than doubled the size of our workforce so that as of august 31 2007 we had approximately 170000 employees located in more than 150 cities in 49 countries increasingly our expansion is taking place outside of the united states and europe with particular growth in our locations in india and the philippines the size of our company presents significant management and organizational challenges and these issues may become more pronounced if we continue our rate of expansion for example it takes time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge skills or experience that our business model requires continued growth may make it increasingly difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values strategies and goals similarly it could become increasingly difficult to maintain common standards across an expanding enterprise or to effectively institutionalize our knowhow finally the size and scope of our operations increases the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose the company to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our large and expanding enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

    

we expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions designed to enhance our capabilities however there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired financial or operating results furthermore we face numerous risks in integrating any businesses we might acquire we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions which could divert our attention from other business operations our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations we could face challenges combining service delivery operations consolidating it and administrative infrastructure and assimilating employees into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin or our ability to grow our business if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or further improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services 

 

  

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

 

risks that relate to ownership of our class a common shares 

 

  

our employees and former employees continue to hold significant amounts of equity in accenture in the form of accenture ltd class a common shares restricted share units and options and shares in our subsidiaries most of which are exchangeable or redeemable for accenture ltd class a common shares the majority of these holdings are or may become freely tradable in the marketplace as described below 

 

  

 34 

  in fiscal 2007 we eliminated a requirement that senior executives who hold covered shares and who remain employed by accenture continue to maintain beneficial ownership of and be restricted from transferring at least 25 of these shares at all times during their employment we replaced this “25 minimum holding requirement” with a graduated waiver of transfer restrictions that takes effect on a phasedin quarterly basis through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we eliminated the 25 minimum holding requirement in the belief that it would benefit shareholders by decreasing the large number of shares whose transfer restrictions would not otherwise lapse until the later of july 24 2009 or the termination of our senior executives’ employment and that it would benefit retention by removing a structural incentive for senior executives to resign starting in 2009 to achieve greater liquidity for their shareholdings even though we still maintain share ownership guidelines that dictate specific ownership levels for active senior executives see “business—organizational structure—senior executive ownership requirements” the waiver described above will permit many of our active senior executives to transfer or sell into the marketplace a portion of their shares significantly earlier than would have been the case in the past and there is a risk this could have an adverse effect on our share price 

 

the following table shows the total number of covered shares held by active employees scheduled to be released from transfer restrictions each quarter this table reflects the adoption of the phasedin quarterly waiver described above starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and assumes that all covered persons who are active employees as of october 1 2007 remain actively employed by accenture through june 1 2009 the actual number of additional covered shares that become available for transfer as a result of the waiver will be reduced depending on the number of covered persons who cease to be employed prior to june 1 2009 

 

 

 

  

 35 

    

the following table shows the total number of covered shares held by former employees scheduled to be released from transfer restrictions each quarter this table assumes that no covered persons who are active employees as of october 1 2007 retire or resign through june 1 2009 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

 

  although the holders may choose to defer delivery of some of these shares for tax purposes it is foreseeable that a significant number of these shares could be sold on the open markets following their delivery 

 

furthermore as of october 1 2007 a total of 42671428 accenture ltd class a common shares were issuable pursuant to options of which options to purchase an aggregate of 40114479 class a common shares were exercisable and options to purchase an aggregate of 2556949 class a common shares are scheduled to become exercisable during the calendar years indicated below 

 

 

 

upon delivery of restricted stock or exercise of employee stock options under our 2001 stock incentive plan our employees or former employees may choose to sell a significant number of our shares in open market transactions there is a risk that this could put additional downward pressure on the price of our class a common stock 

 

  

our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 

  

our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our revenues operating results and profitability to vary include 

 

 37 

   

  

as a result of any of these factors our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be adversely affected 

 

  

we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

 

  

we are organized under the laws of bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states it might not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda or in countries other than in the united states where we have assets based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than in the united states where we have assets 

    

our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

 

under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his conduct and the loss suffered 

 

  

we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

  

any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect that any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

in september 2007 the state of connecticut filed an action in state superior court in hartford against accenture arising out of an alleged data security breach the action arises in connection with work we undertook for the state of connecticut’s office of the comptroller the “corect project” during which accenture properly came into the possession of confidential information including personally identifiable information concerning connecticut citizens the complaint alleges that some of the information was subsequently placed on a server maintained by the state of ohio by accenture employees who were transferred from the corect project to a similar project for the state of ohio and that a backup tape from the ohio server containing some of the information was stolen in june 2007 from an ohio state employee the state of connecticut claims that accenture breached its contract with the connecticut comptroller’s office and also asserts negligence and the unauthorized taking of information by accenture the complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages including restitution of some unspecified portion of the amount paid to accenture pursuant to the corect project contract during the investigation of this matter it was discovered that confidential information belonging to several other accenture clients appeared on the ohio server and accenture has notified the affected clients although these events represent a breach of accenture’s internal policies on data security we have no evidence that any individual has been harmed as a result accenture is committed to maintaining the security of its clients’ data and is conducting an internal investigation to ensure the integrity of all confidential data including personally identifiable information in its possession accenture is committed to taking all appropriate remedial actions in addition to the connecticut suit it is possible that other affected parties could bring similar lawsuits or proceedings we do not believe these matters would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

on april 12 2007 the us department of justice the “doj” intervened in a civil “qui tam” action previously filed under seal by two private individuals in the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas against accenture and several of its indirect subsidiaries the complaint alleges that in connection with work we undertook for the us federal government we received payments resale revenue or other benefits as a result of alliance agreements we maintain with technology vendors and others in violation of our contracts with the us government andor applicable law or regulations similar suits were brought against other companies in our industry the total amount of the payments resale revenue and other benefits alleged in the complaint is 32 million the suit alleges that these amounts were not disclosed to the government in violation of the federal false claims act and the antikickback act among other statutes the doj complaint seeks various remedies including treble damages statutory penalties and disgorgement of profits the suit could lead to other related proceedings by various agencies of the us government including potential suspension or debarment proceedings we intend to defend this matter vigorously and do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

as previously reported in july 2003 we became aware of an incident of possible noncompliance with the foreign corrupt practices act andor with accenture’s internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in the middle east in 2003 we voluntarily reported the incident to the 

  appropriate authorities in the united states promptly after its discovery shortly thereafter the sec advised us it would be undertaking an informal investigation of this incident and the doj indicated it would also conduct a review since that time there have been no further developments we do not believe that this incident will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

overview 

 

revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

 

our results of operations are also affected by the economic conditions levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance although we are continuing to see strong demand for our services we continue to expect that revenue growth 

  rates across our segments may vary from quarter to quarter during fiscal 2008 as economic conditions vary in different industries and geographic markets 

 

revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2007 were 1970 billion compared with 1665 billion for fiscal 2006 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 13 in local currency revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were 511 billion compared with 397 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 an increase of 29 in us dollars and 23 in local currency 

 

consulting revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2007 were 1186 billion compared with 989 billion for fiscal 2006 an increase of 20 in us dollars and 15 in local currency for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 consulting revenues before reimbursements were 304 billion compared with 219 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 an increase of 38 in us dollars and 32 in local currency 

 

outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2007 were 784 billion compared with 675 billion for fiscal 2006 an increase of 16 in us dollars and 12 in local currency outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were 207 billion compared with 177 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 an increase of 17 in us dollars and 12 in local currency outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year longterm relationships with many of our clients continue to contribute to our success in growing our outsourcing business consistent with broader market trends our recently signed outsourcing contracts are of shorter duration and therefore of smaller initial total contract value than they have been in the past despite this our average annualized revenue per contract is steady longterm complex outsourcing contracts including their consulting components require ongoing review of their terms and scope of work in light of our clients’ evolving business needs and our performance expectations should the size or number of modifications to these arrangements increase as our business continues to grow and these contracts evolve we may experience increased variability in expected cash flows revenues and profitability 

 

as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations during the majority of fiscal 2006 the weakening of various currencies versus the us dollar resulted in an unfavorable currency translation and decreased our reported revenues operating expenses and operating income during the majority of fiscal 2007 the us dollar weakened against many currencies resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues operating expenses and operating income compared to the same period in the prior year if this trend continues in fiscal 2008 our us dollar revenue growth will be higher than our growth in local currency in the future if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies our us dollar revenue growth may be lower than our growth in local currency 

 

the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice personnel and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable work sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek 

  to manage as a percentage of revenues at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prioryear periods operating expenses also include reorganization costs and benefits which may vary substantially from year to year 

 

gross margin revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the three months and year ended august 31 2007 were 312 and 307 respectively compared with 341 and 300 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2006 the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the three months ended august 31 2007 was principally due to the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the year ended august 31 2007 was principally due to the net impact during fiscal 2006 of the nhs transfer agreement as defined below and the secondquarter fiscal 2006 nhs adjustments partially offset by higher annual bonus accruals during fiscal 2007 see “—the nhs contracts” 

 

our costmanagement strategy is to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify costmanagement initiatives a primary element of this strategy is to aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs to meet the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 

 

our headcount increased to approximately 170000 as of august 31 2007 from approximately 140000 as of august 31 2006 annualized attrition for the three months and year ended august 31 2007 was 18 excluding involuntary terminations consistent with the three months and year ended august 31 2006 we continue to add substantial numbers of new employees and will continue to actively recruit new employees to balance our mix of skills and resources to meet current and projected future demands replace departing employees and expand our global sourcing approach which includes our global delivery network and other capabilities around the world we have adjusted compensation in fiscal 2007 in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future as in previous fiscal years we have adjusted and expect to continue to adjust pricing with the objective of recovering these increases our margins and ability to grow our business could be adversely affected if we do not continue to manage attrition recover increases in compensation and effectively assimilate and utilize large numbers of new employees 

 

sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were 179 for fiscal 2007 compared with 192 for fiscal 2006 the decrease in these costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was primarily due to higher utilization of our clientservice personnel on contracts and our multiyear program to reduce costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements 

 

operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements remained flat at 126 for the three months ended august 31 2007 compared with the three months ended august 31 2006 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements increased to 127 for the year ended august 31 2007 from 111 for the year ended august 31 2006 excluding the effects of reorganization benefits operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the year ended august 31 2007 increased 21 percentage points compared with the year ended august 31 2006 the increase was principally due to the net impact during fiscal 2006 of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter fiscal 2006 nhs adjustments partially offset by higher annual bonus accruals during fiscal 2007 see “—the nhs contracts” 

 

from time to time we purchase accenture shares through our openmarket purchase program and also purchase redeem and exchange accenture shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees during the year ended august 31 2007 we purchased 2308 million of our shares this comprised 441 million for purchases of 133 million accenture ltd 

  class a common shares and 1867 million for redemptions and purchases of 542 million accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees 

 

the nhs contracts 

 

we previously entered into certain large longterm contracts the “nhs contracts” to provide systems and services to the national health service in england the “nhs” during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 there were several developments that significantly increased the risks and uncertainties associated with the nhs contracts and we recorded a 450 million aggregate loss provision that was reflected in cost of services of our government and products operating groups on september 28 2006 we entered into an agreement the “nhs transfer agreement” to transfer to a third party all of our rights and obligations under the nhs contracts except those relating to the picture archiving communication system the nhs transfer agreement resulted in a 339 million reduction in revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 which was offset by a decrease in cost of services including a reversal of 396 million of the loss provision recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded impairment writedowns on operational services assets totaling 57 million these fourthquarter fiscal 2006 adjustments were reflected in the operating results of our government and products operating groups during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the transfer and substantially all related activities were completed for less than the maximum 125 million loss we previously estimated we would incur in fiscal 2007 and no material obligations remain 

 

bookings and backlog 

 

new contract bookings for the three months ended august 31 2007 were 4946 million with consulting bookings of 3129 million and outsourcing bookings of 1817 million new contract bookings for the year ended august 31 2007 were 21974 million with consulting bookings of 12654 million and outsourcing bookings of 9320 million 

 

we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending on the timing of the signing of a small number of large contracts information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and additions to existing contracts subsequent cancellations extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 

 

the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 

  consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition income taxes and defined benefit pension plans 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

 

we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimated revenues for applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities contract loss provisions recorded as of august 31 2007 and 2006 are immaterial 

 

revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

 

outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on 

  outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

 

costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

 

revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to emerging issues task force issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

 

revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

 

our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since we typically have approximately 5 to 10 percent more work days in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

  revenues before reimbursements include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements including those relating to travel and outofpocket expenses and other similar thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services 

 

income taxes 

 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

 

we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 342 compared with 255 for fiscal 2006 

 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

 

as a matter of course we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 

 

defined benefit pension plans 

 

in the united states and certain other countries we maintain and administers defined benefit pension plans the annual cost of these plans can be significantly affected by changes in assumptions and differences between expected and actual experience 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires companies to prospectively recognize the funded status of 

  pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas no 158 gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” that have not yet been recognized through pension expense will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax until they are amortized as a component of net periodic pensionpostretirement benefits expense sfas no 87 requires the recognition of an additional minimum liability if the market value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation as the end of the measurement date had accenture not been required to adopt sfas no 158 as of august 31 2007 we would have recognized an additional minimum liability pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 87 additionally sfas no 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their yearend balance sheet date we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions as of august 31 2007 and will adopt the yearend measurement date provision as of august 31 2009 

 

the adoption of sfas no 158 impacted the august 31 2007 consolidated balance sheet as follows increase in assets of 2 million decrease in liabilities of 24 million and increase in shareholders’ equity of 26 million for additional information refer to note 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we utilize actuarial methods required by sfas no 87 to account for our defined benefit pension plans the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans two of the most significant assumptions are the discount rates and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in making these assumptions we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations the assumptions assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension expense are determined as of june 30 or august 31 for our us and nonus benefit plans 

 

key assumptions used to determine annual pension expense are as follows 

 

 

 

discount rate 

 

the discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation our methodology for selecting the discount rate for our us plans is to match the plans’ cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity the discount rate assumption for our nonus plans primarily reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments the discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year our estimated us pension expense for fiscal 2008 reflects a 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate while our nonus estimated pension expense for fiscal 2008 reflects a 40 basis point increase in our discount rate these changes in discount rate will increase estimated pension expense in fiscal 2008 by approximately 44 million 

  a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our annual pension expense by 65 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by 66 million 

 

expected return on plan assets 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns on pension plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio a 750 expected return on plan assets assumption was used for both fiscal 2008 and 2007 for the us plans while the expected return on plan assets assumptions for the nonus plans were 597 and 567 in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

a 25 basis point change in our return on plan assets would change our annual pension expense by 38 million 

 

us generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur for example while the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year these differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time for accenture positive market returns occurred for fiscal 2007 and 2006 causing actual pension plan asset returns to exceed our expected returns 

 

general 

 

our us pension plans include plans covering certain us employees and former employees as well as a frozen plan related to former preincorporation partners as of august 31 2007 our us employee plans had a projected benefit obligation of 840 million and assets of 939 million no fiscal 2008 contributions will be required for the us employee pension plans we have not determined whether we will make additional voluntary contributions for us employee pension plans in fiscal 2008 the frozen plan for former partners is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of 133 million as of august 31 2007 

 

nonus pension plan obligations totaled 653 million as of august 31 2007 while nonus pension assets totaled 587 million we contributed 94 million to nonus plans in fiscal 2007 and expect to contribute approximately 25 million in fiscal 2008 

 

pension expense was 90 million and 151 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively pension expense for fiscal 2008 is estimated to be approximately 72 million the fiscal 2008 pension expense estimate incorporates the 2008 assumptions described above 

 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

 

our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services government products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of revenues before reimbursements because our management believes revenues before reimbursements are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating 

  groups to differing degrees the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups localcurrency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

 

revenues presented by operating group geographic region and type of work were as follows

sales and marketing 

 

sales and marketing expense was 1904 million in fiscal 2007 an increase of 196 million or 12 over fiscal 2006 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 97 from 102 over this period this decrease as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was primarily due to lower business and market development costs as a result of higher utilization of our client service personnel on contracts

  these liabilities in fiscal 2006 the reduction in liabilities was primarily due to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to note 3 reorganization costs benefits to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” we anticipate that reorganization liabilities will be substantially diminished by the end of fiscal 2008 because we expect final determination will have occurred however resolution of current tax audits initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement andor recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our consolidated income statement

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and 2006 were 342 and 255 respectively the effective tax rate increased in 2007 primarily as a result of benefits recorded in fiscal 2006 related to final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities final determinations of prior year tax liabilities including final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations reduced the annual effective tax rate in 2007 and 2006 by 18 and 108 percentage points respectively

cost of services 

 

cost of services was 13234 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 1232 million or 10 over fiscal 2005 and an increase as a percentage of revenues to 73 in fiscal 2006 from 70 in fiscal 2005 cost of services before reimbursable expenses was 11652 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 1198 million or 11 from fiscal 2005 cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 70 in fiscal 2006 from 67 in fiscal 2005 gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements decreased to 300 of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2006 from 328 in fiscal 2005 

 

the increase in cost of services and the decrease in gross margins as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were due primarily to operating losses associated with the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments see “— the nhs contracts” 

 

sales and marketing 

 

sales and marketing expense was 1708 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 150 million or 10 over fiscal 2005 and increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 102 in fiscal 2006 from 100 in fiscal 2005

reorganization benefits 

 

we recorded net reorganization benefits of 48 million during fiscal 2006 which included a 72 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 24 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities as of august 31 2006 the remaining liability for reorganization costs 

  was 351 million of which 267 million was classified as current liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations could occur within 12 months during fiscal 2005 we recorded net reorganization benefits of 89 million which included a 115 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 26 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities in both periods the reduction in liabilities was primarily due to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to note 3 reorganization costs benefits to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” we anticipate that reorganization liabilities will be substantially diminished by the end of fiscal 2008 because the final statutes of limitations will have expired in a number of tax jurisdictions by the end of that year however tax audits or litigation may delay final settlements final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement andor recording a reorganization benefit or cost in our consolidated income statement 

 

operating income 

 

operating income was 1841 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 270 million or 13 from fiscal 2005 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was 111 and 136 in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effects of reorganization benefits during fiscal 2006 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have decreased by 05 percentage points had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights during fiscal 2005 and adjusted for reorganization benefits operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 would have decreased by 22 percentage points the decreases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were principally due to operating losses associated with the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments partially offset by lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements see “— the nhs contracts”

gain on investments net was 2 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 19 million from fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2005 gain on investments net reflects gains on our retained interests in our venture and investment portfolio which we sold in fiscal 2003 

 

interest income 

 

interest income was 130 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 21 million or 20 over fiscal 2005 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest rates 

  other expense 

 

other expense was 28 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 17 million over fiscal 2005 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were 255 and 316 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2006 primarily as a result of benefits related to final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities and a 38 percentage point benefit related to updated estimates of the probable future benefit of certain deferred tax assets final determinations of prior year tax liabilities including final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations reduced the annual effective tax rate in 2006 and 2005 by 108 and 64 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities in fiscal 2006 and 2005 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 09 and 14 percentage points respectively these reductions in the 2006 tax rate were partially offset by increases in the tax rate of 16 percentage points related to changes in our geographic mix of income including decreases in uk income resulting from nhs contract losses and increases in other nondeductible items 

 

minority interest 

 

minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income of accenture ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture ltd since january 2002 minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

 

minority interest was 460 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 109 million or 19 from fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to lower net income and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average ownership interests to 32 for the year ended august 31 2006 from 37 for the year ended august 31 2005 

 

earnings per share 

 

diluted earnings per share were 159 in fiscal 2006 compared with 156 in fiscal 2005 for fiscal 2005 had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights our reported diluted earnings per share would have been 140 for information regarding our earnings per share calculation see note 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves we may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

 

 66 

   

as of august 31 2007 cash and cash equivalents of 3314 million combined with 300 million of liquid fixedincome securities that are classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheet totaled 3614 million compared with 3530 million as of august 31 2006 an increase of 84 million 

 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

  

operating activities the 37 million decrease in cash provided by was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities including payments of approximately 176 million to the nhs in connection with the nhs transfer agreement partially offset by higher net income 

 

investing activities the 107 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment partially offset by an increase in proceeds from marketable securities and lower spending on business acquisitions during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

financing activities the 184 million increase in cash used was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of common shares and an increase in cash dividends paid partially offset by a 51 million increase in cash received for accenture ltd class a common shares issued under accenture’s employee share programs for additional information see note 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next 12 months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

  borrowing facilities 

 

as of august 31 2007 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 

 

 

 

  

under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 164 million and 153 million of letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition we had no other shortterm borrowings as of august 31 2007 and 2006 

 

we also had total outstanding debt of 25 million and 50 million as of august 31 2007 and 2006 respectively which was primarily incurred in conjunction with the purchase of accenture hr services 

 

share purchases and redemptions 

 

the board of directors of accenture ltd has authorized funding for our publicly announced openmarket share purchase program for acquiring accenture ltd class a common shares and for redemptions and repurchases of accenture ltd class a common shares accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees effective as of march 24 2006 the board of directors of accenture ltd authorized an additional 15 billion for the purchase redemption and exchange from time to time of our shares including openmarket share purchases effective as of march 2 2007 the board of directors of accenture ltd authorized an additional 15 billion for the purchase redemption and exchange from time to time of our shares in addition during the year ended august 31 2007 the board of directors of accenture ltd separately authorized funding for two discounted tender offers for accenture sca class i common shares 

  a summary of our share purchase activity for cash during the year ended august 31 2007 is as follows 

 

 

 

  

as of august 31 2007 our available authorization was 1650 million which included 900 million and 750 million for the openmarket share purchase program and other share purchase programs respectively 

 

openmarket purchases 

 

accenture has conducted a publicly announced openmarket share purchase program for accenture ltd class a common shares these purchased shares are currently utilized to provide for select employee benefits such as equity awards to our senior executives these shares are held by one or more subsidiaries of accenture ltd and are treated as treasury shares 

 

other share redemptions 

 

on may 15 2007 we filed a registration statement on form s3 relating to 203349557 of accenture ltd class a common shares the “registration statement” the registration statement allows us at our option to issue freely tradable accenture ltd class a common shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of accenture sca class i common shares held by accenture’s senior executives former executives and their permitted transferees during fiscal 2007 we issued 3185481 accenture ltd class a common shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of accenture sca class i common shares 

  senior executive ownership requirements 

 

to ensure that senior executives continue to maintain equity ownership levels that accenture considers meaningful we require current senior executives to comply with the accenture senior executive equity ownership policy this policy requires senior executives to own accenture equity valued at a multiple ranging from 1 to 6 of their base compensation determined by their position level 

 

senior executive trading policy 

 

in july 2005 we implemented a senior executive trading policy applicable to our senior executives that provides among other things that covered shares held by actively employed senior executives will be subject to companyimposed quarterly trading guidelines we set allocation limits of unrestricted covered shares based on a composite average weekly volume of trading in accenture ltd class a common shares these guidelines allow us to manage the total number of shares redeemed sold or otherwise transferred by our senior executives in any calendar quarter the policy guidelines which can be adjusted by management are not legal or contractual restrictions however and there is a risk that the internal sanctions available to us might not adequately dissuade individual employees from attempting transfers in excess of the amounts permitted under the policy the senior executive trading policy also prohibits senior executives from trading in any accenture equity during any companydesignated blackout period 

 

subsequent development 

 

on september 25 2007 accenture ltd declared a cash dividend of 042 per share on our class a common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 12 2007 accenture ltd will cause accenture sca to declare a cash dividend of 042 per share on its class i common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 9 2007 both dividends are payable on november 15 2007 

 

obligations and commitments 

 

as of august 31 2007 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

 

 

 70 

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have various agreements by which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters generally these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold licensed or certain intellectual property rights and other matters payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract furthermore our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement historically we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate as of august 31 2007 we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments 

 

from time to time we enter into contracts with clients whereby we have joint and several liability with other participants andor third parties providing related services and products to clients under these arrangements we and other parties may assume some responsibility to the client or a third party for the performance of others under the terms and conditions of the contract with or for the benefit of the client or in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations to date we have not been required to make any payments under any of the contracts described in this paragraph for further discussion of these transactions see note 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

 

as of august 31 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of sfas no 158 the effect of adopting sfas no 158 on our consolidated balance sheet as of august 31 2007 has been included in the accompanying 2007 consolidated financial statements we are currently assessing the impact of the change in measurement date on our consolidated financial statements for additional information see note 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission the “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab no 108” sab no 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment sab no 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 and as a result is effective for our fiscal year ending august 31 2007 the adoption of sab 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which is a change in accounting for income taxes fin 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized measured and derecognized in financial statements requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified in the balance sheet and provides transition and interimperiod guidance among other provisions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and as a 

  result is effective for us beginning september 1 2007 upon adoption the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 

 

we have substantially completed the process of evaluating the effect of fin 48 on our consolidated financial statements as of the beginning of the period of adoption september 1 2007 we estimate that the cumulative effects of applying fin 48 will be recorded as an immaterial adjustment to beginning retained earnings in addition in accordance with the provisions of fin 48 we will reclassify an estimated 700 to 800 million of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits from current to noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes therefore all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts these instruments are generally shortterm in nature with typical maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

 

we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure as of august 31 2007 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 9 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 9 million as of august 31 2006 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 32 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 33 million 

 

interest rate risk 

 

the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of august 31 2007 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

 

equity price risk 

 

the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

19   and their permitted transferees into the market on july 24 2005 certain restrictions contained in accenture ltd’s byelaws and accenture sca’s articles of association that provided the basis for our share management plan expired for more historical information about the share management plan see the “certain transactions and relationships” section in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 31 2004 filed with the sec on november 5 2004 

accenture senior executive trading policy

 item 1a risk factors tableend   in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition andor operating results 

 

   our success depends on our ability to develop and implement consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry developments and client needs we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace also services solutions and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully deliver client work 

20   

   the consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing markets are highly competitive we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings including 

 in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide 

  some of our competitors may have larger customer bases andor greater financial marketing or other resources than we do larger and bettercapitalized competitors may have enhanced abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals additionally some of our competitors particularly those located in regions with lower costs of doing business may be able to provide services and solutions at lower cost than we can particularly in the more commoditized aspects of the outsourcing and systems integration markets there is a risk that increased competition particularly in the outsourcing market could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices our results of operations may suffer 

  in addition we may face greater competition from companies that have increased in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers in particular we continue to see consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software developers and vendors and service providers this vertical integration may result in greater convergence among previously separate technology functions or reduced access to products and may adversely affect our competitive position 

   global economic and political conditions affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve a significant or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients’ financial condition and the levels of business activity of our clients and the industries we serve this may reduce our clients’ demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 

21   

   our clients include national provincial state and local governmental entities our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

   the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government agency involved but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities additionally because of their visibility and political nature government projects may present a heightened risk to our reputation either of these could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

   our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract new work from our base of existing clients at times on a sole source basis if a client is not satisfied with our services or solutions including those of subcontractors we employ the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate 

22   existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

   if we fail to meet our contractual obligations fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners or otherwise breach obligations to clients or if our subcontractors dispute the terms of our agreements with them we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines we may find ourselves committed to providing services that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will cause us financial loss if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope of our potential liability if we cannot meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements then we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

   our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive projectbyproject basis although we do not centrally track the termination provisions of our contracts we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice a majority of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and these shorterduration contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days notice and without significant penalty longerterm larger and more complex contracts such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated profits lost upon termination of the contract additionally large client projects often involve multiple contracts or stages and a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work 

  terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in client strategies or the economy generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected 

   we earned approximately 40 of our revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2006 from our outsourcing services this portion of our business presents potential operational and financial risks that are different from those of our consulting technology and systems integration services in many cases we take over the operation of certain portions of our clients’ businesses and client personnel and contracts are sometimes transferred to us in some cases this could mean that we assume responsibility for portions of our clients’ personnel staffing overhead and similar needs but might not have full ability to control the work and efforts of client personnel or their subcontractors in addition 

23   we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients’ businesses that are transferred to us 

  this type of work also presents financial risks to us outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year this could exert downward pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts which might not be offset by improved performance on older outsourcing contracts in our portfolio in addition we face considerable competition for outsourcing work and our clients are increasingly using intensive contracting processes and aggressive contracting techniques sometimes assisted by thirdparty advisors 

   increasingly large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on the ability of these subcontractors vendors and service providers to meet their project obligations in a timely manner the quality of our services and solutions could suffer if our subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner do not deliver their products and services in accordance with project requirements in addition certain work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances some of these structures require us to assume responsibility to the client for the performance of third parties whom we do not control see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— offbalance sheet arrangements” if our subcontractors or these third parties fail to deliver their contributions on time or at all if their contributions do not meet project requirements or if we are unable to obtain reimbursement for liabilities of third parties that we have assumed our ability to perform could be adversely affected or we might be subject to additional liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues profitability or cash flow 

   our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

   our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit 

24   margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

   the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

   we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions depending on the particular contract these include timeandmaterials pricing fixedprice pricing and contracts with features of both of these pricing models our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate or used ineffectively if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we could face greater risk when pricing our outsourcing contracts as many of our outsourcing projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations utilizing workforces with different skillsets and competencies and geographically distributed service centers furthermore on outsourcing work we occasionally hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing work frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing contract there is a risk that we will underprice our contracts or fail to accurately 

25   estimate the costs of performing the work in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings in connection with the performance of this work including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

   we have an increasing number of contracts many of which are outsourcing contracts that include incentives related to factors such as costs incurred benefits produced goals attained and adherence to schedule many of our contracts including business transformation outsourcing contracts provide that payment of all or a portion of our fees is contingent upon our clients meeting revenueenhancement costsaving or other contractually defined goals that are complex and often dependent in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts we estimate that a majority of our contracts include pricing terms that condition some or all of our fees on the achievement of contractually defined goals 

   we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own see “business— alliances” as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors loss of or limitations on our relationships with them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

   we have offices and operations in 49 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 75 countries in fiscal 2006 approximately 46 of our revenues before reimbursements were attributable based upon where client services are supervised to our activities in our americas region 46 were attributable to our activities in our europe middle east and africa region “emea” and 8 were attributable to our activities in our asia pacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world in tandem with professionals resident in other countries located in more than 40 delivery centers if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters security breaches failure to maintain compliance with our clients control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we report our operating results in us dollars a significant percentage of our revenues before reimbursements is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues before reimbursements operating income and the value of balancesheet items originally denominated in other currencies declines in the value of other currencies against the us dollar could cause our consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be lower than 

26   our consolidated earnings in local currency terms and could decrease the profitability of our contracts that are denominated in those currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities would be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

  international hostilities terrorist activities natural disasters and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results acts of terrorist violence — such as those of recent years in the united states spain and england — armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us these events could adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks conflicts and wars if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

  we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information we are also required at times to manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

  we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies our clients may request 

27   that we provide an audit of control activities we perform for them when we host or process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

  our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business because we provide services to clients in more than 75 countries we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal regimes on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights 

  legislation related to certain nonus corporations has been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture however additional legislative proposals remain under consideration in various legislatures which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future changes in laws and regulations applicable to foreign corporations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 

  in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act which prohibits giving anything of value intended to influence the awarding of government contracts although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from us federal procurement contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

   our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability as the continuation of pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities we must continuously improve our management of costs our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs might not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing our longterm costreduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in infrastructure and other costs rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and competency workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategies for growth we 

28   might not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces control our costs or improve our efficiency despite increased cost savings we could experience erosion of operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements if current pricing pressures accelerate 

   our success and ability to grow are dependent in part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and grow our business competition for skilled personnel in consulting systems integration and technology and outsourcing is intense at all levels of experience and seniority we are particularly dependent on the skills of our senior executives and if we are not able to successfully retain and motivate our senior executives and experienced managers our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized at the same time the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects and global delivery centers the process of recruiting training and retaining employees places significant demands on our resources there is a risk that at certain points in time and in certain geographical regions we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require or that it will prove difficult to retain them in a competitive labor market if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient numbers of talented people we might need to rely on subcontractors to fill certain of our labor needs and costs for hiring subcontractors may be greater than those for our permanent employees if we are not successful at retaining and motivating our senior executives attracting and retaining other qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of our business or utilizing our people effectively then our ability to compete for and successfully complete work for our clients could be adversely affected 

   our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients on the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we also maintain reserves for uncollectible receivables however actual default rates on receivables could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our reserves for uncollectible receivables in limited circumstances we also extend financing to our clients which we could fail to collect at august 31 2006 we had 263 million of client financing outstanding a client must meet established criteria to receive financing from us and any significant extension of credit requires approval by senior levels of our management however there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients in addition recovery of client financing depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements client financing balances may be uncollectible 

   in 2004 the united states congress enacted legislation relating to the tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions we do not believe this legislation applies to accenture however we are not able to predict with certainty whether the us internal revenue service will challenge our interpretation of the legislation nor are we able to 

29   predict with certainty the impact of regulations or other interpretations that might be issued related to this legislation future developments or the finalization of regulations or interpretations could materially increase our tax expense 

  in addition there have been from time to time negative comments in the media regarding companies incorporated in bermuda this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of a negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our clients receiving negative media attention from doing business with us 

   we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions historically in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

  we could lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be acquired or sued and this could disrupt use of their products or services by accenture and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

   our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

  depending on the circumstances we could be required to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with a contract than we otherwise generally do in which case we would seek to crosslicense the use of the intellectual property however in certain situations we forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create which limits our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects

   since 2001 we have almost doubled the size of our workforce so that we now have approximately 140000 employees located in more than 150 cities in 49 countries although we have altered our management processes to keep pace with our geographical and workforce expansion the size of our company presents significant management and organizational challenges and these issues may become more pronounced if we continue our rate of expansion for example our plans call for the establishment of multiple global delivery centers and the hiring of numerous new employees in an expansion of our offshore workforce it might take time for our newer employees to develop the knowledge skills or experience that our business model requires furthermore if we continue to grow it could become increasingly difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage our personnel and operations and effectively communicate to our personnel worldwide our core values strategies and goals similarly it could become increasingly difficult to maintain common standards across an expanding enterprise or to effectively institutionalize our knowhow finally the size and scope of our operations increases the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose the company to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our large and expanding enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

   although we have completed a number of relatively small acquisitions to date our experience with acquisitions of other businesses is limited if we continue to acquire other businesses we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions which could divert our attention from other business operations our organizational structure and limited experience integrating acquired businesses could also make it difficult for us to efficiently consummate these transactions or integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations some of the challenges we could face integrating acquired businesses or technologies include combining service delivery operations consolidating it and administrative infrastructure assimilating employees and minimizing diversion of management attention accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin or our ability to grow our business 

risks that relate to ownership of our class a common shares 

   our employees and former employees continue to hold significant numbers of accenture ltd class a common shares restricted share units and options as well as other classes of stock of our subsidiaries that are exchangeable or redeemable for accenture ltd class a common shares 

 

 31       if a large number of former senior executives or their transferees choose to transfer their shares upon the release of transfer restrictions on july 24 2009 it could have an adverse impact on the share price of our class a common shares 

  we have on several occasions conducted transactions including two discounted tender offers of accenture sca shares and targeted repurchases of accenture ltd shares designed to address the potential impact of the buildup of shares having transfer restrictions that would otherwise lapse on july 24 2009 there is no assurance that these transactions or any other transactions we might undertake in the future will have the desired impact of meaningfully reducing the number of shares whose transfer restrictions lapse on a common date 

 

 32   

 

    although the holders may choose to defer delivery of some of these shares for tax purposes it is foreseeable that a significant number of these shares could be sold on the open markets following their delivery 

    upon delivery of restricted stock or exercise of employee stock options under our 2001 stock incentive plan our employees or former employees may choose to sell a significant number of our shares in open market transactions there is a risk that this could put additional downward pressure on the price of our class a common stock 

   our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors these factors include 

 33     our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future making them difficult to predict some of the factors that could cause our revenues operating results and profitability to vary include 

   as a result of any of these factors our share price could be difficult to predict and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future in addition if litigation is instituted against us following variability in our share price we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation and our share price could be adversely affected 

   we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

34   

   we are organized under the laws of bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states it might not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda or in countries other than in the united states where we have assets based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than in the united states where we have assets 

   our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

  under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his conduct and the loss suffered 

35   

   we might need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

   any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

overview 

  revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

  our results of operations are also affected by the economic conditions levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance the current economic environment continues to stimulate the technology spending of many companies we are also continuing to see an increase in the number of opportunities from companies seeking revenuegenerating initiatives in the global economy in addition to costcutting initiatives we expect that 

44   revenue growth rates across our segments may vary from quarter to quarter during fiscal 2007 as economic conditions vary in different industries and geographic markets 

  revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2006 were 1665 billion compared with 1555 billion for fiscal 2005 an increase of 7 in us dollars and 9 in local currency revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were 397 billion compared with 392 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 an increase of 1 in us dollars and remained flat in local currency 

  consulting revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2006 were 989 billion compared with 956 billion for fiscal 2005 an increase of 3 in us dollars and 6 in local currency for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 consulting revenues before reimbursements were 219 billion compared with 238 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 a decrease of 8 in us dollars and 9 in local currency 

  outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2006 were 675 billion compared with 599 billion for fiscal 2005 an increase of 13 in us dollars and 14 in local currency outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were 177 billion compared with 155 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 an increase of 14 in us dollars and 12 in local currency outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year longterm relationships with many of our clients continue to contribute to our success in growing our outsourcing business longterm complex outsourcing contracts including their consulting components require ongoing review of their terms and scope of work in light of our clients’ evolving business needs and our performance expectations should the size or number of modifications to these arrangements increase as our business continues to grow and these contracts evolve we may experience increased variability in expected cash flows revenues and profitability 

  we previously entered into certain large longterm contracts the “nhs contracts” under which we were engaged by the national health service in england the “nhs” to design develop and deploy new patient administration assessment and care systems the “systems” for local healthcare providers and subsequently to provide ongoing operational services the “operational services” once these systems were deployed during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 there were several developments that significantly increased the risks and uncertainties associated with these contracts and materially impacted our estimates of the contract revenues and costs we expected to record in connection with the nhs contracts to reflect our revised estimates with respect to design development and deployment we recorded a 450 million loss provision in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 on september 28 2006 we entered into a tripartite agreement the “nhs transfer agreement” with the nhs and computer sciences corporation “csc” an unrelated third party under which we agreed to transfer to csc all of our rights and obligations under the nhs contracts except those relating to the picture archiving communication system “pacs” this resulted in a 339 million reduction in revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as we reversed revenues before reimbursements related to our design development and deployment activities previously recorded under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the assumption that these amounts would be recovered from billings for deployment of the systems the impact of the 339 million reduction in revenues before reimbursements was offset by a decrease in cost of services including a reversal of 396 million of the loss provision recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 partially offset by impairment write downs on operational services assets totaling 57 million in connection with the operational services we expect losses of approximately 125 million during the first half of fiscal 2007 associated with the transition and winddown of work 

45   related to the nhs transfer agreement we expect to complete the transfer during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 our remaining obligations under the nhs contracts are immaterial see “— the nhs contracts” 

  as we are a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations during the majority of fiscal 2006 the weakening of various currencies versus the us dollar resulted in an unfavorable currency translation and decreased our reported revenues operating expenses and operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the us dollar weakened against other currencies resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues operating expenses and operating income if this trend continues in fiscal 2007 our us dollar revenue growth may be higher than our growth in local currency terms if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in fiscal 2007 our us dollar revenue growth may be lower than our growth in local currency 

  the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the utilization of our clientservice workforces and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable work sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings the level of concentration of clients in a particular industry or market and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek to manage at levels consistent with changes in activity levels in our business operating expenses also include reorganization benefits and costs which may vary substantially from year to year 

  effective september 1 2005 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” resulting in a change in our method of recognizing sharebased compensation expense specifically we now record compensation expense for employee stock options and for our employee share purchase plan had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights for the three months ended and the year ended august 31 2005 we estimate that sharebased compensation expense would have increased by 69 million and 218 million respectively for additional information see footnote 11 sharebased compensation to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the year and three months ended august 31 2006 were 300 and 341 respectively compared with 328 and 330 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2005 the decrease in the annual gross margin as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was principally due to the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments see “—the nhs contracts” 

  our costmanagement strategy is to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify costmanagement initiatives a primary element of this strategy is to aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs to meet the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 

  our headcount increased to approximately 140000 at august 31 2006 from approximately 123000 at august 31 2005 annualized attrition for the year and three months ended august 31 

46   2006 was 18 excluding involuntary terminations consistent with the year and three months ended august 31 2005 we continue to add substantial numbers of new employees and will continue to actively recruit new employees to balance our mix of skills and resources to meet current and projected future demands replace departing employees and expand our global sourcing approach which includes our network of delivery centers and other capabilities around the world we have adjusted and may need to continue to adjust compensation during fiscal 2007 in certain industry segments skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees our margins and ability to grow our business could be adversely affected if we do not continue to manage attrition and if we do not effectively utilize and assimilate substantial numbers of new employees into our workforces 

  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were 19 for fiscal 2006 compared with 20 for fiscal 2005 the decreases in these costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were primarily due to lower spending in geographic facilities and technology costs partially offset by an increase in market and businessdevelopment activities 

  operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements decreased to 111 for the year ended august 31 2006 from 136 for the year ended august 31 2005 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements decreased to 126 for the three months ended august 31 2006 from 130 for the three months ended august 31 2005 had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights for the three months and year ended august 31 2005 we estimate that operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the three months and year ended august 31 2005 would have decreased by 18 and 14 percentage points respectively the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the year ended august 31 2006 was principally due to the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments and higher sharebased compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r see “—the nhs contracts” 

  from time to time we purchase accenture shares through our openmarket purchase program and also purchase redeem and exchange accenture shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees in fiscal 2006 accenture purchased 2057 million of its shares this comprised 352 million for purchases of 15 million accenture ltd class a common shares and 1704 million for redemptions and purchases of 678 million accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 accenture redeemed and repurchased 87 million accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees for 246 million on september 11 2006 accenture sca and one of its subsidiaries made a tender offer to accenture sca class i common shareholders that resulted in the redemption and purchase effective as of october 11 2006 of an aggregate of 75 million accenture sca class i common shares at a price of 2475 per share the total cash outlay for these transactions was approximately 187 million 

the nhs contracts 

  we previously entered into the nhs contracts under which we were engaged by the nhs to design develop and deploy the systems for local healthcare providers and subsequently to provide the operational services once these systems were deployed for the purposes of our financial reporting we separated these components of the nhs contracts into two units of accounting the 

47   revenues and costs from the nhs contracts are apportioned equally between our government and products operating groups 

   we recognize revenues in connection with the design development and deployment of the systems on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates at any point indicate that costs will exceed revenues a loss provision for the full anticipated loss is recorded in the period it is first identified 

  our estimates of contract revenues and costs in connection with the design development and deployment of the systems are subject to underlying estimates and assumptions including among others those relating to our ability to design develop and deploy the systems on a timely basis the ability of our subcontractors and others involved in the program to perform adequately and on a timely basis the level and timing of demand for the systems from local healthcare providers and the nhs’ ability to agree on detailed implementation plans and other terms of the nhs contracts 

  during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 there were several developments that significantly increased the risks and uncertainties associated with the nhs contracts and materially impacted our estimates of the contract revenues and costs that we expected to record in connection with the design development and deployment of the systems these developments included among other things subcontractor performance issues modification of our planned deployment approach expectations of increased costs based upon current experience and increased uncertainty as to timing and level of deployment demand due to these developments in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded a 450 million aggregate loss provision that was reflected in cost of services of our government and products operating groups 

  on september 28 2006 we entered into the nhs transfer agreement with the nhs and csc under which we agreed to transfer to csc all of our rights and obligations under the nhs contracts except those relating to pacs we expect to complete the transfer during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

  the nhs transfer agreement resulted in a 339 million reduction in revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as we reversed revenues before reimbursements related to our design development and deployment activities previously recorded under the percentageofcompletion method of accounting under the assumption that these amounts would be recovered from billings for deployment of the systems the impact of the 339 million reduction in revenues before reimbursements was offset by a decrease in cost of services including a reversal of 396 million of the loss provision recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 

   we record costs as they are incurred and record revenues as the services are performed and amounts are earned in connection with the operational services under the terms of the nhs transfer agreement we will transition the operational services to csc during the first half of fiscal 2007 in 

48   addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we recorded impairment write downs on operational services assets totaling 57 million in connection with the operational services we expect losses of approximately 125 million during the first half of fiscal 2007 associated with the transition and winddown of work related to the nhs transfer agreement we expect to complete the transfer during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

   in addition to the transition and winddown costs related to the operational services during 2007 we will repay approximately 120 million to the nhs representing the difference between the deployment and services billings that we received under the nhs contracts during their terms and the amounts we are entitled to retain by agreement under the nhs transfer agreement on october 4 2006 we also remitted approximately 50 million in settlement of liabilities in connection with the nhs transfer agreement these amounts are recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of august 31 2006 

bookings and backlog 

  new contract bookings for the year ended august 31 2006 were 20362 million an increase of 13 from the year ended august 31 2005 with consulting bookings increasing 9 to 10608 million and outsourcing bookings increasing 18 to 9754 million the increase in new contract bookings during fiscal 2006 was attributable to strong contract signings across both types of work without particular dominance by one geographic region new contract bookings for the three months ended august 31 2006 were 4924 million a decrease of 235 million or 5 from new bookings of 5159 million for the three months ended august 31 2005 with consulting bookings increasing 5 to 2542 million and outsourcing bookings decreasing 13 to 2382 million 

  we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however the timing of large new contract bookings can significantly affect the level of bookings in a particular quarter information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and additions to existing contracts subsequent cancellations extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 

  the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and 

49   experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition income taxes variable compensation and defined benefit pension plans 

revenue recognition 

  our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable 

  we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageof completion method pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” percentageof completion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract estimated revenues for applying the percentageof completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet contract loss provisions recorded as of august 31 2006 and 2005 are immaterial 

  revenues from contracts for nontechnology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or costplus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are delivered fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in such contracts our efforts measured by time incurred typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern for nontechnology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms provided the billable amounts are not contingent are consistent with the services delivered and are earned contingent or incentive revenues relating to nontechnology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned 

  outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries in a number of these arrangements we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations revenues are recognized on 

50   outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sab 101 as amended by sab 104 revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus contracts are recognized as the services are performed in such contracts our effort measured by time incurred represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from fixedprice contracts are recognized on a straightline basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

  costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the setup of processes personnel and systems which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or setup activities necessary to enable the outsourced services deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets amounts billable to the client for transition or setup activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided 

  revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to emerging issues task force issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 

  revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred ie classified as a liability and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

  our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since we typically have approximately 5 to 10 percent more work days in our first and third quarters than in our second and 

51   fourth quarters our revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

  revenues before reimbursements include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements including those relating to travel and outof pocket expenses and other similar thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services 

income taxes 

  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

  we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 255 compared with 316 for fiscal 2005 

  no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

  as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the company owing additional taxes we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 

defined benefit pension plans 

  in the united states and certain other countries accenture maintains and administers defined benefit pension plans the annual cost of these plans can be significantly affected by changes in assumptions and differences between expected and actual experience accenture utilizes actuarial methods required by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” to account for defined benefit pension plans the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate 

52   the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans two of the most significant assumptions are the discount rates and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in making these assumptions we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations the assumptions assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension expense are determined as of june 30 or august 31 for our us and nonus benefit plans 

  key assumptions used to determine annual pension expense are as follows 

 

   an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation the discount rate is a significant assumption our methodology for selecting the discount rate for our us plans is to match the plans’ cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon corporate bonds for each maturity the discount rate assumption for our nonus plans reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome debt instruments both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the company’s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year our estimated us pension expense for fiscal 2007 reflects a 125 basis point increase in our discount rate while our nonus estimated pension expense for fiscal 2007 reflects a 40 basis point increase in our discount rate these changes in discount rate will decrease estimated pension expense in fiscal 2007 by approximately 456 million 

  a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our annual pension expense by 77 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by 82 million 

   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns on pension plan assets the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio a 750 expected return on plan assets assumption was used for both fiscal 2007 and 2006 for the us plans while the expected return on plan assets assumptions for the nonus plans were 567 and 557 in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  a 25 basis point increase in our return on plan assets would decrease our annual pension expense by 31 million a 25 basis point decrease in our return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by 31 million 

  us generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those 

53   changes occur for example while the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year these differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time for accenture positive market returns occurred for fiscal 2006 and 2005 causing actual pension plan asset returns to exceed our expected returns 

   our us pension plans include plans covering certain us employees and former employees as well as a frozen plan related to basic retirement benefits for former preincorporation partners at august 31 2006 our us employee plans had a projected benefit obligation of 718 million and assets of 802 million after taking into account 25 million in contributions made in fiscal 2006 no fiscal 2007 contributions will be required for the us employee pension plans we have not determined whether we will make additional voluntary contributions for us employee pension plans in fiscal 2007 the frozen plan for former partners is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of 122 million at august 31 2006 

  nonus pension plan obligations totaled 616 million at august 31 2006 while nonus pension assets totaled 458 million we contributed 61 million to nonus plans in fiscal 2006 and expect to contribute 45 million in fiscal 2007 

  pension expense was 151 million and 114 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively pension expense for fiscal 2007 is estimated to be approximately 104 million the fiscal 2007 pension expense estimate incorporates the 2007 assumptions described above as well as the impact of increased pension plan assets resulting from our us pension plan discretionary contributions of 25 million made in fiscal 2006 

  sfas no 87 requires us to recognize a minimum pension liability if the fair value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for additional information refer to footnote 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” additional charges to equity may be required in the future depending on future contributions made to our pension plans returns on pension plan assets and interest rates 

revenues by segment operating group 

  our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services government products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of revenues before reimbursements because our management believes revenues before reimbursements are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees decisions relating to staffing levels are not made uniformly across our operating segments due in part to the needs of our operating groups to tailor their workforces to meet the specific needs of their businesses the shift in mix toward outsourcing contracts is not uniform among our operating groups and consequently neither is the impact on operating group results caused by this shift local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

54     revenues for each of our operating groups geographic regions and types of work were as follows 

  

nm  not meaningful 

   the company conducts business in the following countries that individually comprised more than 10 of consolidated revenues before reimbursements within the last three years 

 year ended august 31 2006 compared to year ended august 31 2005 

revenues 

  our communications  high tech operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 4177 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 4001 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 4 in us dollars and 6 in local currency terms the increase was primarily due to revenue growth in our 

55   electronics  high tech industry group across all geographic regions consulting growth in our americas and asia pacific regions and outsourcing growth in our emea and asia pacific regions 

  our financial services operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3558 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 3408 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 4 in us dollars and 7 in local currency terms the increase was driven by revenue growth in our banking industry group across all regions and in our insurance industry group in our americas and asia pacific regions this revenue growth was partially offset by revenue declines in our capital markets industry group in the americas and emea regions and in our insurance industry group in the emea region 

  our government operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2221 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 2172 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 2 in us dollars and 4 in local currency terms the increase was due to strong outsourcing revenue growth across all geographic regions partially offset by a 169 million reduction in consulting revenues associated with the resolution of the nhs matter recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “—the nhs contracts” 

  our products operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 4011 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 3570 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 12 in us dollars and 15 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues the increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth in our americas region particularly in our health  life sciences retail consumer goods  services and industrial equipment industry groups our consumer goods  services and industrial equipment industry groups also had strong growth in our emea region in addition products revenues were positively affected by revenues recognized in connection with a contract termination in our retail industry group in our emea region during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 these increases were partially offset by a 169 million reduction in consulting revenues associated with the resolution of the nhs matter recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “—the nhs contracts” 

  our resources operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2666 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 2389 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 12 in both us dollars and local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues we experienced strong revenue growth in our energy chemicals and natural resources industry groups across all geographic regions in our utilities industry group we had strong growth in our americas region offset by revenue declines in our emea and asia pacific regions 

  our americas region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 7741 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 6730 million for fiscal 2005 an increase of 15 in us dollars and 14 in local currency terms growth was primarily due to our business in the united states canada and brazil 

  our emea region recorded revenues before reimbursements of 7644 million for fiscal 2006 compared with 7735 million for fiscal 2005 a decrease of 1 in us dollars and an increase of 3 in local currency terms the decrease was primarily due to a decline in our business in the united kingdom including the impact of a 339 million reduction in consulting revenues associated with the resolution of the nhs matter recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see “—the nhs contracts” this decline was partially offset by growth in our business in italy ireland france belgium the netherlands germany and spain 

  our asia pacific region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 1261 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 1082 million for fiscal 2005 an increase of 17 in us dollars and 20 in 

56   local currency terms the increase in revenues was primarily driven by our business in australia china and japan 

operating expenses 

  operating expenses were 16387 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 1404 million or 9 over fiscal 2005 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 90 in fiscal 2006 from 88 in fiscal 2005 as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were 89 and 86 in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively operating expenses for fiscal 2006 included sharebased compensation expense of 271 million or 2 of revenues before reimbursements compared with sharebased compensation expense of 88 million or 1 of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights during fiscal 2005 we estimate that operating expenses would have included 306 million in total sharebased compensation expense or 2 of revenues before reimbursements 

   cost of services was 13234 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 1232 million or 10 over fiscal 2005 and an increase as a percentage of revenues to 73 in fiscal 2006 from 70 in fiscal 2005 cost of services before reimbursable expenses was 11652 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 1198 million or 11 from fiscal 2005 cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 70 in fiscal 2006 from 67 in fiscal 2005 gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements decreased to 300 of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2006 from 328 in fiscal 2005 

  the increase in cost of services and the decrease in gross margins as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were due primarily to operating losses associated with the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments see “—the nhs contracts” 

   sales and marketing expense was 1708 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 150 million or 10 over fiscal 2005 and remained flat as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements at 10 in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 

   general and administrative costs were 1493 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 19 million or 1 from fiscal 2005 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 9 in fiscal 2006 from 10 in fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to lower spending in geographic facilities and technology costs 

   we recorded net reorganization benefits of 48 million during fiscal 2006 which included a 72 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 24 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities at august 31 2006 the remaining liability for reorganization costs was 351 million of which 267 million was classified as current liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations could occur within 12 months during fiscal 2005 we recorded net reorganization benefits of 89 million which included a 115 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 26 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities in both periods the reduction in liabilities was primarily due to final determinations of certain reorganization 

57   liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” we anticipate that reorganization liabilities will be substantially diminished by the end of fiscal 2008 because the final statutes of limitations will have expired in a number of tax jurisdictions by the end of that year however tax audits or litigation may delay final settlements final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement andor recording a reorganization benefit or cost in our consolidated income statement 

operating income 

  operating income was 1841 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 270 million or 13 from fiscal 2005 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was 111 and 136 in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding the effects of reorganization benefits during fiscal 2006 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have decreased by 05 percentage points had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights during fiscal 2005 and adjusted for reorganization benefits operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 would have decreased by 22 percentage points the decreases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were principally due to operating losses associated with the net impact of the nhs transfer agreement and the secondquarter nhs adjustments partially offset by lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements see “—the nhs contracts” 

  operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows 

  

  58     the following commentary includes the effect on operating income had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights in fiscal 2005 and adjusting for reorganization benefits recorded during fiscal 2006 and 2005 

 gain on investments net 

  gain on investments net was 2 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 19 million from fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2005 gain on investments net reflects gains on our retained interests in our venture and investment portfolio which we sold in fiscal 2003 

interest income 

  interest income was 130 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 21 million or 20 over fiscal 2005 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest rates 

other expense 

  other expense was 28 million in fiscal 2006 an increase of 17 million over fiscal 2005 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  the effective tax rates for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were 255 and 316 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2006 primarily as a result of benefits related to final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities and a 38 percentage point benefit related to updated estimates of the probable future benefit of certain deferred tax assets final determinations of prior year tax liabilities 

59   including final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations reduced the annual effective tax rate in 2006 and 2005 by 108 and 64 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities in fiscal 2006 and 2005 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 09 and 14 percentage points respectively these reductions in the 2006 tax rate were partially offset by increases in the tax rate of 16 percentage points related to changes in our geographic mix of income including decreases in uk income resulting from nhs contract losses and increases in other nondeductible items 

minority interest 

  minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—organizational structure” the resulting net income of accenture ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture ltd since january 2002 minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

  minority interest was 460 million in fiscal 2006 a decrease of 109 million or 19 from fiscal 2005 the decrease was primarily due to lower net income and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares average ownership interests to 32 for the year ended august 31 2006 from 37 for the year ended august 31 2005 

earnings per share 

  diluted earnings per share were 159 in fiscal 2006 compared with 156 in fiscal 2005 for fiscal 2005 had we expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights our reported diluted earnings per share would have been 140 for information regarding our earnings per share calculation see footnote 2 earnings per share to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data”

nm  not meaningful 

 revenues 

  our communications  high tech operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 4001 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 3741 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 7 in us dollars and 4 in local currency terms the increase was primarily due to growth in consulting revenues particularly in our americas and emea regions and our electronics  high tech industry group outsourcing revenue growth particularly in our emea and asia pacific regions was offset by the substantial reduction in late fiscal 2004 of the scope of our work with a major north american telecommunications client as a result of that client’s changing business strategies 

  our financial services operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3408 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2771 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 23 in us dollars and 18 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in 

61   revenues this growth was driven by the strength of our business in both the americas and emea regions particularly in the united kingdom and in our banking and insurance industry groups 

  our government operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2172 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 1995 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 9 in us dollars and 6 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues results were driven by strong growth in our emea and asia pacific regions which was partially offset by a decrease in consulting revenues from clients in the americas particularly in the united states 

  our products operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3570 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2979 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 20 in us dollars and 16 in local currency terms these increases were attributable to strong growth in both consulting and outsourcing in all industry groups 

  our resources operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2389 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2178 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 10 in us dollars and 5 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues we experienced strong overall growth in our energy and natural resources industry groups as well as in our emea region in our utilities industry group growth in outsourcing revenues before reimbursements offset a decline in consulting revenues before reimbursements 

  our americas region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 6730 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 6133 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 10 in us dollars and 9 in local currency terms contributing to this growth was our business in the united states and brazil partially offset by a decline in local currency revenues before reimbursements in canada 

  our emea region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 7735 million for fiscal 2005 compared with 6572 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 11 in local currency terms a key contributor to this growth was our business in the united kingdom where revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 increased 19 in us dollars and 13 in local currency terms over fiscal 2004 primarily due to revenues from several exceptionally large contracts sold during fiscal 2004 that began making significant contributions to revenues in fiscal 2005 also contributing to the strong growth in emea for fiscal 2005 was our business in germany italy the netherlands and spain revenue growth in the united kingdom for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was affected by lower than expected revenues on the nhs contracts 

  our asia pacific region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 1082 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 968 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 12 in us dollars and 8 in local currency terms our business in australia and in india contributed to the increase in revenues partially offset by a decline in our business in japan 

operating expenses 

  operating expenses were 14983 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1628 million or 12 over fiscal 2004 and remained flat at 88 of revenues in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were 86 and 87 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effects of restructuring and reorganization operating expenses before reimbursements as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have increased by 01 percentage points for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

62     the strengthening of various currencies against the us dollar increased our reported operating expenses in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and partially offset corresponding increases in reported revenues 

   cost of services was 12002 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1505 million or 14 over fiscal 2004 and an increase as a percentage of revenues to 70 in fiscal 2005 from 69 in fiscal 2004 cost of services before reimbursable expenses was 10455 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1398 million or 15 over fiscal 2004 cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 67 in fiscal 2005 from 66 in fiscal 2004 gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements decreased to 328 of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2005 from 338 in fiscal 2004 

  the increase in cost of services and the decrease in gross margins as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were due primarily to the lowerthanexpected margins attributable to delays under the nhs contracts a small number of delivery inefficiencies in certain operating groups and incurred and expected cost overruns associated with the development of reusable assets in connection with certain client contracts partially offset by lower variable compensation expense 

   sales and marketing expense was 1558 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 70 million or 5 over fiscal 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 10 in fiscal 2005 from 11 in fiscal 2004 a key driver of the increase in sales and marketing expense was a 100 million increase in market and businessdevelopment activities partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense 

   general and administrative costs were 1512 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 171 million or 13 over fiscal 2004 and remained flat as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements at 10 in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 

   we recorded net reorganization benefits of 89 million in fiscal 2005 which included a 115 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 26 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities at august 31 2005 the remaining liability for reorganization costs was 381 million of which 64 million was classified as current liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations could occur within 12 months in fiscal 2004 we recorded net reorganization benefits of 78 million which included a 105 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 27 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 the reduction in liabilities was primarily due to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  during fiscal 2004 we recorded restructuring costs of 107 million relating to our global consolidation of office space primarily in the united states and the united kingdom these costs included losses on operating leases and writedowns of related assets such as leasehold improvements resulting from abandoned office space no restructuring costs were recorded during fiscal 2005 

63   operating income 

  operating income was 2111 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 352 million or 20 over fiscal 2004 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was 136 and 129 in fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effects of restructuring and reorganization operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have decreased by 01 percentage points for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

  operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows 

  

    excluding the effects of reorganization and restructuring operating income in fiscal 2005 increased by 234 million from fiscal 2004 reflecting increases in communications  high tech financial services and resources which were partially offset by decreases in government and products the following commentary excludes the effects of reorganization and restructuring 

 64   

 gain on investments net 

  gain on investments net was 21 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 18 million from fiscal 2004 this reflects gains on our retained interests in our venture and investment portfolio which we sold in fiscal 2003 

interest income 

  interest income was 108 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 48 million or 81 from fiscal 2004 the increase resulted primarily from the increase in interest rates and an increase in average client financing balances during fiscal 2005 compared with the average balances for fiscal 2004 

other expense income 

  other expense was 11 million in fiscal 2005 compared with other income of less than 1 million in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 expense was primarily due to net foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal 2005 compared with net foreign currency exchange gains in fiscal 2004 

provision for income taxes 

  the effective tax rates for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were 316 and 320 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2005 as a result of changes in our geographic distribution of income and benefits related to final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities this was partially offset by increases related to net nondeductible items and updated estimates of current and prioryear income tax exposures final determinations of prior year tax liabilities in 2005 and 2004 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 64 and 22 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 14 and 15 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities had the effect of increasing pretax income without a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes final determinations could also occur in fiscal 2006 which could generate income tax benefits 

minority interest 

  minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—accenture organizational structure” the resulting net income of accenture ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture ltd since january 2002 minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

  minority interest was 568 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 36 million or 7 over fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in income before minority interest of 286 million partially offset by a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc 

65   exchangeable shares average ownership interests to 37 for the year ended august 31 2005 from 43 for the year ended august 31 2004 

earnings per share 

  diluted earnings per share were 156 in fiscal 2005 compared with 122 in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 net reorganization benefits had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 009 the fiscal 2004 restructuring costs relating to our global consolidation of office space had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per share by 007 and the fiscal 2004 net reorganization benefits had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 008 refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

liquidity and capital resources 

  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves we may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

   at august 31 2006 cash and cash equivalents of 3067 million combined with 463 million of liquid fixedincome securities that are classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheet totaled 3530 million compared with 3185 million at august 31 2005 an increase of 345 million 

  cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated cash flow statement are summarized in the following table 

   operating activities the 781 million increase in cash provided in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in revenues and the related collections of billings during fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 the 131 million increase in cash provided in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net income an increase in accounts payable and 50 million in discretionary contributions to our us employees’ pension plans in fiscal 2005 compared with 230 million in fiscal 2004 

66     investing activities the 322 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in the purchases of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from marketable securities the 322 million decrease in cash used in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by the acquisition of the net assets of capgemini’s north american health practice for 179 million in cash including 4 million of acquisition expenses during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we invested 306 million 318 million and 282 million respectively in capital expenditures primarily for technology assets furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements to support our operations we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately 335 million in fiscal 2007 

  financing activities the 557 million increase in cash used was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of common shares and the payment of 268 million in cash dividends partially offset by a 138 million increase in cash received for accenture ltd class a common shares issued under accenture’s employee share programs for additional information see footnote 13 material transactions affecting shareholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data” the 689 million increase in cash used in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by an increase of net purchases of common shares in fiscal 2005 partly offset by a net decrease in restricted cash of the predecessor to the accenture share employee compensation trust 

  we believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months we also believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities 

borrowing facilities 

  at august 31 2006 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes 

  

 67     under the borrowing facilities described above we had an aggregate of 153 million and 186 million of letters of credit outstanding at august 31 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition we had zero and 9 million of other shortterm borrowings at august 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we also had total outstanding debt of 50 million and 62 million at august 31 2006 and 2005 respectively which was primarily incurred in conjunction with the purchase of accenture hr services 

client financing 

  in limited circumstances we agree to extend financing to clients on technology integration consulting contracts the terms vary by contract but generally we contractually link payment for services to the achievement of specified performance milestones we finance these client obligations primarily with existing working capital and bank financing in the country of origin imputed interest is recorded at market rates in interest income in the consolidated income statement information pertaining to client financing is as follows 

   the decrease in client financing from august 31 2005 was primarily due to the reversal of client financing balances related to the impact of the nhs transfer agreement see “— the nhs contracts” 

share purchases and redemptions 

  from time to time accenture purchases accenture ltd class a common shares through the company’s openmarket purchase program and also purchases redeems and exchanges accenture shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees in fiscal 2005 the board of directors of accenture granted authority to utilize 30 billion for purchases and redemptions of shares held by current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees and openmarket share purchases as well as for the acquisition of certain accenture ltd class a common shares awarded to employees pursuant to restricted share units awarded in connection with our initial public offering effective as of march 24 2006 the board of directors of accenture authorized an additional 15 billion for the purchase redemption and exchange from time to time of accenture shares including openmarket share purchases

  from time to time we enter into contracts with clients whereby we have joint and several liability with other participants andor third parties providing related services and products to clients under these arrangements we and other parties may assume some responsibility to the client or a third party for the performance of others under the terms and conditions of the contract with or for the benefit of the client or in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations to date we have not been required to make any payments under any of the contracts described in this paragraph for further discussion of these transactions see footnote 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under “financial statements and supplementary data”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes therefore all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

  we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward andor option contracts with the euro accounting for a significant portion of the notional amount being hedged these instruments are generally shortterm in nature with typical maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk from time to time we enter into forward or option contracts of a longterm nature credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates this sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure as of august 31 2006 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 43 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 43 million as of august 31 2005 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 19 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates 

72   against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our hedge instruments of 19 million 

interest rate risk 

  the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at august 31 2006 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

  the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

  in fiscal 2005 accenture developed and announced a new broader career model for its highestlevel executives that recognizes the diversity of roles and responsibilities demonstrated by these employees this new career framework replaces internal use of the “partner” title with the more comprehensive “senior executive” title and applies the “senior executive” title to more than 4100 of our highestlevel employees including those employees previously referred to as partners however for proper context we continue to use the term “partner” in this report to refer to those persons who held the title of partner at the time of our incorporation 

   each class a common share and each class x common share of accenture ltd entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of accenture ltd a holder of a class x common share is not however entitled to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of accenture ltd 

  accenture ltd may redeem at its option any class x common share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the class x common share or 00000225 per share accenture ltd has separately agreed not to redeem any class x common share of a holder if the redemption would reduce the number of class x common shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares held by that holder as the case may be accenture ltd will redeem class x common shares upon the redemption or exchange of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of class x common shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares outstanding class x common shares are not transferable without the consent of accenture ltd

  the amendments to the class ii common shares the creation of class iii common shares and all lettered subseries of that class and the reclassification of all class i common shares held or to be held by accenture ltd and its subsidiaries have no effect on the computation of accenture ltd’s earnings per share

   in april 2002 we introduced our share management plan for partners coupled with the transfer restrictions imposed on our partners in connection with our transition to a corporate structure our share management plan transactions and programs have been effective in increasing our public float and broadening the ownership of accenture ltd class a common shares while providing for the orderly entry of our shares held by our partners former partners and their permitted transferees into the market on july 24 2005 certain restrictions contained in accenture ltd’s byelaws and accenture sca’s articles of association that provided the basis for our share management plan expired for more historical information about the share management plan see the “certain transactions and relationships” section in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 31 2004 filed with the sec on november 5 2004 

   in july 2005 we implemented a senior executive trading policy applicable to our senior executives which provides among other things that all covered shares available for transfer under the covered person transfer restrictions will be subject to quarterly trading guidelines these guidelines seek to limit the total number of these shares redeemed sold or otherwise transferred in any calendar quarter to no more than a composite average weekly volume of trading in accenture ltd class a common shares as of october 24 2005 the covered shares remaining subject to these additional quarterly guidelines represented approximately 55 of the total covered shares outstanding the senior executive trading policy also prohibits senior executives from trading in any accenture equity during any companydesignated blackout period we expect to rigorously enforce this policy 

18   however sanctions under this policy may be prospective in nature and there can be no guarantee that we can prohibit all individual transfers that may be attempted in breach of this policy the senior executive trading policy was implemented in part due to the expiration of the share management plan since july 24 2005 holders of covered shares have been able to individually execute sales redemptions or dispositions of those shares that are free of transfer restrictions and in the case of our senior executives in compliance with the quarterly trading guidelines contained in the senior executive trading policy 

risk factors 

 

   uncertain global economic and political conditions continue to affect many of our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve natural disasters political disruptions or uncertainties and terrorist attacks—such as those of recent years in the united states spain and england—and regional and international armed conflicts have the potential to adversely affect our clients’ levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and consequently the benefits of any economic recovery to our business may take longer to realize 

  our business is also dependent in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers the growth in the use of technology slows down in challenging economic environments although a variety of new technologies—including serviceoriented architectures sensor technologies such as radio frequency identification and wireless mobility services among others—have begun to gain wider acceptance over the past few years currently there is no single new technology wave that is significantly stimulating spending use of new technology for commerce generally requires the understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may make some of their existing personnel processes and infrastructures obsolete 

   our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement management consulting technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace also services solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 

19   

   as a professional services firm we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highcaliber professional services and integrity to attract and retain clients as a result if a client is not satisfied with our services or solutions including those of subcontractors we employ it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses negative publicity related to our client relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners we could be subject to legal liability loss of client relationships or reduced economic return our exposure may be increased in the case of outsourcing contracts in which we become more involved in our clients’ operations our contracts typically include provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the solutions we develop but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 

   unexpected costs delay s or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions could make our contracts unprofitable we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types our ability to properly estimate the costs and timing for completing the projects is critical to the profitability of our contracts while the risks associated with all of these types of contracts are often similar an increasing number of outsourcing contracts entail the coordination of operations diverse geographic and competency workforces and geographically distributed service centers which further complicates the delivery of our services and increases the magnitude of these risks on outsourcing engagements we occasionally hire or transfer to accenture employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing engagements frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing engagement these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our clients’ costs as well as the efficiencies of our methodologies and professionals as we plan to deploy them on projects any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

  under many of our contracts the payment of some or all of our fees is conditioned upon our performance we are increasingly moving away from contracts that are priced solely on a timeandmaterials basis and toward contracts that also include incentives related to factors such as costs incurred benefits produced goals attained and adherence to schedule for example we are entering into an increasing number of outsourcing contracts including business transformation outsourcing contracts under which payment of all or a portion of our fees is contingent upon our clients meeting revenueenhancement costsaving or other contractually defined goals that are increasing in complexity and often dependent in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity we estimate that a majority of our contracts have some fixedprice incentivebased or other pricing terms that condition some or all of our fees on our ability to deliver these defined goals the trend to include greater incentives in our contracts related to additional revenues generated costs incurred benefits produced or our adherence to schedule may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts 

20     our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive engagementbyengagement basis rather than under exclusive longterm contracts a majority of our consulting engagements are less than 12 months in duration while our accounting systems identify the duration of our engagements these systems do not track whether contracts can be terminated upon short notice and without penalty however we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant penalty the advance notice of termination required for contracts of shorter duration and lower revenues is typically 30 days longerterm larger and more complex contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and may include an early termination charge to be paid to us additionally large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client changes in client strategies or the economy generally when contracts are terminated we lose the associated revenues and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods may be lower than expected 

  we may fail to collect amounts extended to clients in limited circumstances we extend financing to our clients which we may fail to collect a client must meet established criteria to receive financing from us and any significant extension of credit requires approval by senior levels of our management at august 31 2005 we had extended 734 million of such financing 

   as we increase the size of our government business both in terms of size and complexity we increase our exposure to various risks inherent in the government contracting process these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 21      the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government agency involved but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs penalties or negative publicity involved any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

   we have offices in 48 countries around the world and provide services to clients in more than 75 countries in fiscal 2005 approximately 43 of our revenues before reimbursements were attributable based upon where client services are supervised to our activities in our americas region 50 were attributable to our activities in our europe middle east and africa region and 7 were attributable to our activities in our asiapacific region in addition our global delivery network comprises local accenture professionals working at client sites around the world in tandem with professionals resident in more than 40 delivery centers around the world 

  as a result we are subject to a number of risks including 

  currency matters the percentage of our revenues before reimbursements earned in currencies other than the us dollar continues to grow consequently declines in the value of other currencies against the us dollar may cause our consolidated earnings stated in us dollars to be lower than our consolidated earnings in local currency terms in some countries we also remain subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies 

  security matters acts of terrorist violence armed hostilities and natural disasters pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients these events also have the potential to disrupt communications and travel and increase the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel 

  control matters we are often required to manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client data if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients whether by our employees or third persons could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

  infrastructure matters extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could adversely affect our ability to serve our clients while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we may be unable to protect our facilities and systems against all such occurrences 

  local legal and political matters because we provide services to clients in more than 75 countries we are subject to numerous and often competing and conflicting legal regimes on matters 

22   as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against the company or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also may result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws may be insufficient to protect our rights 

  the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above not only could affect our business in a country in which they occur but also depending on the country and the operations we have there could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations more broadly 

   the pace of consolidation among our competitors including vertical integration of hardware and software vendors and service providers continues some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with bettercapitalized partners larger and bettercapitalized competitors have enhanced abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals in addition one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting their profit margins 

  historically we have not relied to any material degree on mergers or acquisitions to increase our market share revenues number of market offerings or scope of services we continue to consider acquisitions that are financially and operationally compatible with our business our limited experience with mergers and acquisitions could affect our ability to efficiently consummate andor integrate acquisitions into our ongoing operations any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin or our ability to grow our business 

   our success and ability to grow are dependent in part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and grow our business competition for skilled personnel in the global management consulting technology services and outsourcing industries is intense recruiting training and retention costs and benefits place significant demands on our resources the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious negative effect on us including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and thus maintain or increase our revenues 

23   

   our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization rate or chargeability of our professionals accordingly if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals without corresponding cost reductions our profit margin and our profitability will suffer a continuation of current pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

   our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors including 

   our profitability is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as the continuation of current pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities we must continuously improve our management of costs our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs may not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing and utilization rates our longterm cost reduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in infrastructure and other costs rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and competency workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategies for growth we may not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces control our costs or improve our efficiency 

  despite increased cost savings we may continue to experience erosion of operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements if present trends continue 

   our quarterly revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter making them difficult to predict this may lead to volatility in our share price the factors that are likely to cause these variations are 

 24   

 

   we continue to achieve a greater percentage of our revenues and growth through business transformation outsourcing our approach that combines outsourcing with our other capabilities to help clients transform and outsource key processes applications and infrastructure to improve business performance this strategy could result in higher concentrations of revenues and contributions to income from a smaller number of larger clients on customized outsourcing solutions or from larger numbers of clients for whom we provide morestandardized services and solutions 

  outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year as our outsourcing business continues to grow we may experience increased pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of new outsourcing contracts 

   increasingly large and complex arrangements often require that our products and services incorporate or coordinate with the software systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors 

25   and service providers our ability to serve our clients or deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner may depend on the ability of these vendors and service providers to meet their project milestones in a timely manner if these third parties fail to deliver their contributions on time or at all our ability to perform may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues profitability or cash flow 

  some engagements are complex and may require unique structures and alliances we will continue to manage liabilities or risks on such engagements through rigorous transaction review but we expect that clients may increasingly demand that we assume certain additional contractual obligations and potential but reimbursable liabilities for the performance of our business partners whom we do not control 

   if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we may suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations as a consequence there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities finally the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud regardless of the adequacy of those controls 

   last year the united states congress enacted legislation relating to the tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions we do not believe this legislation applies to accenture however we are not able to predict with certainty whether the us internal revenue service will challenge our interpretation of the legislation nor are we able to predict with certainty the impact of regulations or other interpretations that might be issued related to this legislation future developments or the finalization of regulations or interpretations could materially increase our tax expense 

  other legislative proposals related to certain foreign corporations have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture additional legislative proposals remain under consideration in various legislatures which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future 

  in addition there have been from time to time negative comments in the media regarding companies incorporated in bermuda this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of a negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our clients receiving negative media attention from doing business with us 

   we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation 

26   cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions historically in our contracts we have generally agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we may not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms 

   our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights the steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 

  depending on the circumstances we may be required to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with an engagement than we otherwise generally do in which case we would seek to crosslicense the use of the intellectual property however in very limited situations we forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create which limits our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

   our alliances are an important component of our growth strategy if these relationships do not succeed we may fail to obtain the benefits we hope to derive from these endeavors similarly we may be adversely affected by the failure of one or more of our alliances which could lead to reduced marketing exposure diminished sales and a decreased ability to develop and gain access to solutions as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors poor performance or failures of our alliances could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 the senior executive trading policy was implemented in part due to the expiration on july 24 2005 of our share management plan for partners and the charter provisions we used to create and facilitate that plan since july 24 2005 holders of these shares have been able

   we are organized under the laws of bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda or in countries other than in the united states where we have assets based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in countries other than in the united states where we have assets 

   our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 

  under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his conduct and the loss suffered

overview 

  revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure contracts for new engagements and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 

  our results of operations are also affected by the economic conditions levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients the ability to identify and capitalize on these 

38   market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance the strengthening economic recovery continues to stimulate the technology spending of many companies we are continuing to see an increase in numbers of opportunities from companies seeking revenuegenerating and costcutting initiatives we expect that revenue growth rates across our segments may continue to vary from quarter to quarter during fiscal 2006 as economic recovery continues to take hold at different rates in different industrial and geographic markets 

  revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 were 1555 billion compared with 1367 billion for fiscal 2004 an increase of 14 in us dollars and 10 in local currency revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 392 billion compared with 342 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase of 15 in us dollars and 14 in local currency 

  outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 were 599 billion compared with 508 billion for fiscal 2004 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 14 in local currency outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were 155 billion compared with 128 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase of 21 in us dollars and 20 in local currency outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year the average size of most new outsourcing opportunities we see in the market continues to be smaller than those contracts we executed in fiscal 2004 longterm relationships with many of our clients continue to contribute to our success in growing our outsourcing business longterm complex outsourcing contracts including their consulting components require ongoing review of their terms and scope of work in light of our clients’ evolving business needs and our performance expectations should the size or number of modifications to these arrangements increase as our business continues to grow and these contracts evolve we may experience increased variability in expected cash flows revenues and profitability 

  consulting revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 were 956 billion compared with 859 billion for fiscal 2004 an increase of 11 in us dollars and 7 in local currency for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 consulting revenues before reimbursements were 238 billion compared with 214 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase of 11 in us dollars and 10 in local currency 

  as previously reported we have certain contracts the “nhs contracts” under which we have been engaged to design develop and deploy new patient administration assessment and care systems the “systems” for the national health service in england the “nhs” and subsequently to provide ongoing operational services once these systems have been deployed under the nhs contracts our ability to bill and collect for the unbilled services we have performed is subject to our ability to deploy the systems’ components delays in deployment have resulted in lowerthanexpected revenues margins billings and cash flows in fiscal 2005 

  aggregate losses on the nhs contracts for fiscal 2005 were 140 million in line with our prior estimates at august 31 2005 client financing and other assets net of deferred revenues attributable to this client were 398 million in line with our prior estimates we continue to expect contract losses for fiscal 2006 but at levels less than those experienced in fiscal 2005 and further improved performance in fiscal 2007 the revenues and costs from the nhs contracts are apportioned equally between our government and products operating groups 

  as a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations during fiscal 2005 the strengthening of various currencies versus the us dollar resulted in favorable currency translation and increased our 

39   reported revenues operating expenses and operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the us dollar began to strengthen against other currencies resulting in less favorable currency translation and lower reported us dollar revenues operating expenses and operating income if the us dollar retains its strength in fiscal 2006 our us dollar revenue growth may be lower than our growth in local currency terms 

  the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the chargeability or utilization of our clientservice workforces and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the continuing accelerated growth of new outsourcing contracts chargeability represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable work sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings the level of concentration of clients in a particular industry or market and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek to manage at levels consistent with changes in activity levels in our business operating expenses also include reorganization benefits and costs and restructuring costs which may vary substantially from year to year 

  gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the year and three months ended august 31 2005 were 328 and 330 respectively compared with 338 and 324 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2004 the decrease in the annual gross margin was due primarily to the lowerthanexpected margins attributable to delays under the nhs contracts a small number of delivery inefficiencies in certain operating groups and incurred and expected cost overruns associated with the development of reusable assets in connection with certain client contracts partially offset by lower variable compensation expense 

  our costmanagement strategy is to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify costmanagement initiatives we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs to meet the anticipated demand for our services given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 

  our headcount increased to more than 123000 at august 31 2005 from approximately 103000 at august 31 2004 attrition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was 18 which was in line with our second and third quarters we continue to add substantial numbers of new employees and will continue to actively recruit new employees to balance our mix of skills and resources to meet current and projected future demands replace departing employees and expand our global sourcing approach which includes our network of delivery centers and other capabilities around the world our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected if we do not effectively assimilate substantial numbers of new employees into our workforces 

  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were 20 for fiscal 2005 compared with 21 for fiscal 2004

   for the year ended august 31 2005 new contract bookings were 18028 million a decrease of 10 from the year ended august 31 2004 with consulting bookings increasing 4 to 9728 million and outsourcing bookings decreasing 23 to 8300 million new contract bookings for the three months ended august 31 2005 were 5159 million an increase of 1135 million or 28 over new bookings of 4024 million for the three months ended august 31 2004 with consulting bookings increasing 7 to 2422 million and outsourcing bookings increasing 55 to 2737 million the decreases in new contract bookings for the full 2005 fiscal year were partially attributable to the signing of several very large contracts in fiscal 2004 which significantly increased new contract bookings for that year the size and scope of many of our new outsourcing contract bookings have decreased when compared to new outsourcing contract bookings for the year ended august 31 2004 

  we provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however the timing of large new contract bookings can significantly affect the level of bookings in a particular quarter information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time there are no thirdparty standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings new contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals extensions and additions to existing contracts subsequent cancellations extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 

  the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 

   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses we continually evaluate our estimates judgments and assumptions based on available information and 

41   experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition income taxes variable compensation and defined benefit pension plans 

revenue recognition 

  our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable for technology integration consulting contracts estimated revenues for applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable for nontechnology integration consulting and outsourcing contracts revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and when acceptance where applicable and delivery of agreed benefits have occurred in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition” 

  we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageof completion method pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss accrual is recorded in the period it is first identified 

  outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 

  revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the relative fair value of the elements fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements effective september 1 2003 we adopted emerging issues task force issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” as such for contracts signed after 

42   august 31 2003 revenues are allocated to each element based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent 

  client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred ie classified as a liability and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 

  our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since we typically have approximately 5 to 10 percent more work days in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters our revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters 

  revenues before reimbursements include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements including those relating to travel and outofpocket expenses and other similar thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services 

income taxes 

  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 

  we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 316 compared with 320 for fiscal 2004 

  no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

  as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the company owing additional taxes we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable however final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different 

43   than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 

variable compensation 

  we record compensation expense for payments to be made in later fiscal periods to our senior executives and other employees under the variable compensation portions of our overall compensation programs determining the amount of expense to recognize as operating expenses for variable compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment expenses accrued for variable compensation are based on actual quarterly and annual operational performance versus plan targets and other factors amounts accrued are subject to change in future periods if future performance is below plan targets or is below the performance levels anticipated in prior periods management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available the liability recorded at august 31 2005 for variable compensation was 114 million all of which we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in connection with our transition to a new annual bonus plan for our executives beginning in fiscal 2006 the variable compensation plan will be replaced by an annual bonus plan 

  the following table shows net quarterly variable compensation expense benefit 

   the fiscal 2005 expense of 92 million represents 100 million of variable compensation expense and a reduction of 8 million related to the finalization of estimated payouts accrued for in fiscal 2004 

defined benefit pension plans 

  in the united states and certain other countries accenture maintains and administers defined benefit pension plans the annual cost of these plans can be significantly affected by changes in assumptions and differences between expected and actual experience accenture utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” to account for defined benefit pension plans the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans two of the most significant assumptions are the discount rates and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in making these assumptions we are required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations the assumptions assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension expense are determined as of june 30 for our us benefit plans and as of june 30 or august 31 for our nonus benefit plans 

44     key assumptions used to determine annual pension expense are as follows 

 

   since pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate is a significant assumption an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for highquality for example rated “aa” or higher by moody’s or standard  poors in the us fixedincome debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the company’s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year our estimated us pension expense for fiscal 2006 reflects a 100 basis point decrease in our discount rate while our nonus estimated pension expense for fiscal 2006 reflects a 65 basis point decrease in our discount rate this change in discount rate will increase estimated pension expense in fiscal 2006 by approximately 48 million 

  a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our annual pension expense by 14 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by 16 million 

   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns on pension plan assets the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio a 750 expected return on plan assets assumption was used for both fiscal years 2006 and 2005 for the us plans while the expected return on plan assets assumptions for the nonus plans were 557 and 519 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively the impact of these types of changes on the pension plans in other countries will vary depending upon the status of each respective plan 

  a 25 basis point increase in our return on plan assets would decrease our annual pension expense by 3 million a 25 basis point decrease in our return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by 3 million 

  us generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur for example while the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets should over time approximate the actual longterm returns differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year these differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time for accenture positive market returns occurred for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 causing actual pension plan asset returns to exceed our expected returns declining discount rates which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations offset the positive impact of these asset returns for fiscal 2005 and more than offset the positive impact of these returns for fiscal 2004 

45   

   our us pension plans include plans covering certain us employees and former employees as well as a frozen plan related to basic retirement benefits for former preincorporation partners at august 31 2005 our employee plans had a projected benefit obligation of 819 million and assets of 701 million after taking into account 50 million in contributions made in fiscal 2005 no fiscal 2006 contributions will be required for the us employee pension plans we have not determined whether we will make additional voluntary contributions for us employee pension plans in fiscal 2006 the frozen plan for former partners is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of 138 million at august 31 2005 

  nonus pension plan obligations totaled 512 million at august 31 2005 while nonus pension assets totaled 344 million we contributed 42 million to nonus plans in fiscal 2005 and expect to contribute 43 million in fiscal 2006 

  pension expense was 114 million and 122 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively pension expense for fiscal 2006 is estimated to be approximately 155 million the fiscal 2006 pension expense estimate incorporates the 2006 assumptions described above as well as the impact of increased pension plan assets resulting from our discretionary contributions of 50 million made in fiscal 2005 

  sfas no 87 requires us to recognize a minimum pension liability if the fair value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for additional information refer to footnote 10 retirement and profit sharing plans to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data” additional charges to equity may be required in the future depending on future contributions made to our pension plans returns on pension plan assets and interest rates 

revenues by segmentoperating group 

  our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services government products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of revenues before reimbursements as our management believes revenues before reimbursements are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain engagements the resulting revenues and costs from these engagements may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating segments affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating segments to differing degrees decisions relating to staffing levels are not made uniformly across our operating segments due in part to the needs of our operating groups to tailor their workforces to meet the specific needs of their businesses the shift in mix toward outsourcing contracts is not uniform among our operating groups and consequently neither is the impact on operating group results caused by this shift local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 

46     revenues for each of our operating groups geographic regions and types of work were as follows 

  

nm  not meaningful 

   the company conducts business in two countries that individually comprised more than 10 of consolidated revenues before reimbursements within the last three years the united states represented 37 39 and 43 of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively while the united kingdom represented 17 16 and 14 of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively revenues are attributed to countries based on where client services are supervised 

47   year ended august 31 2005 compared to year ended august 31 2004 

   our communications  high tech operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 4001 million for fiscal 2005 compared with 3741 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 7 in us dollars and 4 in local currency terms the increase was primarily due to growth in consulting revenues particularly in our americas and emea regions and our electronics  high tech industry group outsourcing revenue growth particularly in our emea and asia pacific regions was offset by the substantial reduction in late fiscal 2004 of the scope of our work with a major north american telecommunications client as a result of that client’s changing business strategies 

  our financial services operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3408 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2771 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 23 in us dollars and 18 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues this growth was driven by the strength of our business in both the americas and emea regions particularly in the united kingdom and in our banking and insurance industry groups 

  our government operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2172 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 1995 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 9 in us dollars and 6 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues results were driven by strong growth in our emea and asia pacific regions which was partially offset by a decrease in consulting revenues from clients in the americas particularly in the united states 

  our products operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3570 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2979 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 20 in us dollars and 16 in local currency terms these increases were attributable to strong growth in both consulting and outsourcing in all industry groups 

  our resources operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2389 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 2178 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 10 in us dollars and 5 in local currency terms with both consulting and outsourcing contributing to the growth in revenues we experienced strong overall growth in our energy and natural resources industry groups as well as in our emea region in our utilities industry group growth in outsourcing revenues before reimbursements offset a decline in consulting revenues before reimbursements 

  our americas region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 6730 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 6133 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 10 in us dollars and 9 in local currency terms contributing to this growth was our business in the united states and brazil partially offset by a decline in local currency revenues before reimbursements in canada 

  our europe middle east and africa regions achieved revenues before reimbursements of 7735 million for fiscal 2005 compared with 6572 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 18 in us dollars and 11 in local currency terms a key contributor to this growth was our business in the united kingdom where revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2005 increased 19 in us dollars and 13 in local currency terms over fiscal 2004 primarily due to revenues from several exceptionally large contracts sold during fiscal 2004 that began making significant contributions to revenues in fiscal 2005 also contributing to the strong growth in emea for fiscal 2005 was our business in germany italy the netherlands and spain revenue growth in the united kingdom for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was affected by lower than expected revenues on the nhs contracts in fiscal 2006 revenue growth in the united kingdom will continue to be affected by lowerthanexpected revenues on the nhs contracts 

48     our asia pacific region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 1082 million in fiscal 2005 compared with 968 million for fiscal 2004 an increase of 12 in us dollars and 8 in local currency terms our business in australia and in india contributed to the increase in revenues partially offset by a decline in our business in japan 

   operating expenses were 14983 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1628 million or 12 over fiscal 2004 and remained flat at 88 of revenues in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were 86 and 87 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effects of restructuring and reorganization operating expenses before reimbursements as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have increased by 01 percentage points for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

  the strengthening of various currencies against the us dollar increased our reported operating expenses for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and partially offset corresponding increases in reported revenues 

  in fiscal 2005 we recorded 92 million of net variable compensation expense including a reduction of 8 million related to finalization of estimated payouts accrued for fiscal 2004 compared with 277 million of net variable compensation expense for fiscal 2004 which included a reduction of 4 million related to fiscal 2003 

   cost of services was 12002 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1505 million or 14 over fiscal 2004 and an increase as a percentage of revenues to 70 in fiscal 2005 from 69 in fiscal 2004 cost of services before reimbursable expenses was 10455 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 1398 million or 15 over fiscal 2004 cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 67 in fiscal 2005 from 66 in fiscal 2004 gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements decreased to 328 of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2005 from 338 in fiscal 2004 

  the increase in cost of services and the decrease in gross margins as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements were due primarily to the lowerthanexpected margins attributable to delays under the nhs contracts a small number of delivery inefficiencies in certain operating groups and incurred and expected cost overruns associated with the development of reusable assets in connection with certain client contracts partially offset by lower variable compensation expense 

   sales and marketing expense was 1558 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 70 million or 5 over fiscal 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 10 in fiscal 2005 from 11 in fiscal 2004 a key driver of the increase in sales and marketing expense was a 100 million increase in market and businessdevelopment activities partially offset by a 30 million decrease in variable compensation expense

   general and administrative costs were 1512 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 171 million or 13 over fiscal 2004 and remained flat as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements at 10 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 

   we recorded net reorganization benefits of 89 million in fiscal 2005 which included a 115 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by 26 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities at august 31 2005 the remaining liability for reorganization costs was 381 million of which 64 million was classified as current liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations could occur within 12 months in fiscal 2004 we recorded net reorganization benefits of 78 million which included a 105 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by a 27 million interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities in both fiscal years 2005 and 2004 the reduction in liabilities was primarily due to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  during fiscal 2004 we recorded restructuring costs of 107 million relating to our global consolidation of office space primarily in the united states and the united kingdom these costs included losses on operating leases and writedowns of related assets such as leasehold improvements resulting from abandoned office space no restructuring costs were recorded during fiscal 2005 

operating income 

  operating income was 2111 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 352 million or 20 over fiscal 2004 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements was 136 and 129 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively excluding the effects of restructuring and reorganization operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements would have decreased by 01 percentage points for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 

  operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows 

 50     reorganization benefits and restructuring costs were allocated to the reportable operating groups as follows 

   excluding the effects of reorganization and restructuring operating income in fiscal 2005 increased by 234 million over fiscal 2004 reflecting increases in communications  high tech financial services and resources which were partially offset by decreases in government and products the following commentary excludes the effects of reorganization and restructuring 

   the nhs contracts will continue to adversely affect the operating income of our government and products operating groups in fiscal 2006 but we expect the effect will be to a lesser extent than in fiscal 2005 

gain on investments net 

  gain on investments net was 21 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 18 million over fiscal 2004 this reflects gains on our retained interests in our venture and investment portfolio which we sold in fiscal 2003 

interest income 

  interest income was 108 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 48 million or 81 over fiscal 2004 the increase resulted primarily from the increase in interest rates and an increase in average client financing balances during fiscal 2005 compared with the average balances for fiscal 2004 

51   other expense income 

  other expense was 11 million in fiscal 2005 compared with other income of less than 1 million in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 expense was primarily due to net foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal 2005 compared with net foreign currency exchange gains in fiscal 2004 

provision for income taxes 

  the effective tax rates for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were 316 and 320 respectively the effective tax rate decreased in 2005 as a result of changes in our geographic distribution of income and benefits related to final determinations of prioryear tax liabilities this was partially offset by increases related to net nondeductible items and updated estimates of current and prioryear income tax exposures final determinations of prior year tax liabilities in 2005 and 2004 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 64 and 22 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 14 and 15 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities had the effect of increasing pretax income without a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes final determinations could also occur in fiscal 2006 which could generate income tax benefits 

minority interest 

  minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our partners former partners and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc subsidiaries see “business—accenture organizational structure” the resulting net income of accenture ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture ltd since january 2002 minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our avanade inc subsidiary 

  minority interest was 568 million in fiscal 2005 an increase of 36 million or 7 over fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in income before minority interest of 286 million partially offset by a reduction in the minority’s average ownership interests to 37 at august 31 2005 from 43 at august 31 2004 

earnings per share 

  diluted earnings per share were 156 in fiscal 2005 compared with 122 in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 net reorganization benefits had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 009 the fiscal 2004 restructuring costs relating to our global consolidation of office space had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per share by 007 and the fiscal 2004 net reorganization benefits had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 008 refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data”

   our communications  high tech operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3741 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 14 over fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased outsourcing revenues consulting revenues and favorable currency translation also contributed to increased revenues over fiscal 2003 outsourcing revenues benefited from strong revenue growth with our communications and electronics  high tech industry groups in the americas and europe consulting revenues benefited from growth in europe latin america and asia pacific slightly offset by a decline in north america lower outsourcing revenues in north america were due partly to a substantial reduction in the scope of our work with a major telecommunications client as a result of that client’s changing business strategies 

  our financial services operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2771 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 18 over fiscal 2003 results were primarily driven by strong growth in outsourcing revenues higher consulting revenues and favorable currency translation revenue growth in our banking and insurance industry groups particularly in the united kingdom contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues consulting revenues benefited from the continued economic recovery of clients in our capital markets industry group 

  our government operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 1995 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 26 over fiscal 2003 results were primarily driven by strong growth in both outsourcing and consulting revenues in addition to favorable currency translation revenue growth with european clients particularly in the united kingdom and with clients in the asia pacific region contributed to increased consulting revenues which were partially offset by decreased revenues from clients in the united states outsourcing revenue growth benefited from increased revenues in all geographic regions in particular with the us federal government 

  our products operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2979 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 14 over fiscal 2003 primarily driven by increased outsourcing revenues consulting revenues and favorable currency translation also contributed to increased revenues over fiscal 2003 a majority of our industry groups particularly the retail  consumer and the pharmaceuticals  medical products industry groups contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues consulting revenues increased primarily due to growth in our asia pacific region revenues as well as growth in our automotive and health services industry groups in all geographies consulting revenue growth was partially offset by decreased revenues in our transportation  travel services industry group particularly in emea 

  our resources operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2178 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 11 over fiscal 2003 as increases in our outsourcing revenues and a favorable currency translation more than offset the slight decrease in consulting revenues all industry groups in resources in particular utilities contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues the euro and pound sterling contributed to the favorable currency translation consulting revenue growth in our energy metals  mining and utilities industry groups was offset by a decrease in our chemicals and forest products industry group revenues 

  our americas region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 6133 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 5671 million in fiscal 2003 an increase of 8 in us dollars and 7 in local currency a key contributor to this growth was our canadian business where revenues before reimbursements grew 52 in us dollars over fiscal 2003 this growth was partially offset by items mentioned above with respect to our communications  high tech government and resources operating groups that were primarily concentrated in our americas region 

54     our europe middle east and africa regions achieved revenues before reimbursements of 6572 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 5353 million in fiscal 2003 an increase of 23 in us dollars and 10 in local currency this increase was primarily due to strong growth in the united kingdom france and spain as well as the strengthening of the pound sterling and euro against the us dollar 

  our asia pacific region achieved revenues before reimbursements of 968 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 794 million in fiscal 2003 an increase of 22 in us dollars and 12 in local currency this increase was largely driven by strong growth in our business in japan and australia 

   operating expenses were 13355 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 1509 million or 13 over fiscal 2003 and represented 88 of revenues in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements operating expenses before reimbursable expenses remained flat at 87 in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in fiscal 2004 operating expenses included restructuring costs of 107 million relating to the company’s global consolidation of office space and benefits of 78 million primarily resulting from final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 the restructuring costs of 107 million and reorganization benefits of 78 million increased operating expenses before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements by 02 percentage points the strengthening of various currencies against the us dollar increased our reported operating expenses for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 which partially offset corresponding increases in reported revenues 

  we incurred severance costs of 111 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 161 million of severance costs in fiscal 2003 we expensed 277 million for variable compensation in fiscal 2004 compared with 11 million of variable compensation expense in fiscal 2003 

   cost of services was 10497 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 1410 million or 16 over fiscal 2003 and an increase as a percentage of revenues to 69 in fiscal 2004 from 68 in fiscal 2003 cost of services before reimbursable expenses was 9057 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 1549 million or 21 over fiscal 2003 cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 66 in fiscal 2004 from 64 in fiscal 2003 gross margins revenues before reimbursements less cost of services before reimbursements decreased to 34 of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal 2004 from 36 in fiscal 2003 

  the primary drivers of the increase in cost of services and the decrease in total gross margins were the continued shift in our mix of business toward outsourcing and higher variable compensation expense partly offset by lower severance costs the strengthening of various currencies against the us dollar also contributed to the 1549 million increase 

   sales and marketing expense was 1488 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 30 million or 2 over fiscal 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 11 in fiscal 2004 from 12 in fiscal 2003 key drivers of the increase in sales and marketing expense were a 51 million increase in marketdevelopment activities and branding costs and a 39 million increase in variable compensation expense partly offset by a 69 million decrease in businessdevelopment costs 

55   

   general and administrative costs were 1340 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 21 million or 2 over fiscal 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 10 in fiscal 2004 from 11 in fiscal 2003 the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to a 60 million increase in business protection costs partly offset by a 42 million decrease in geographic facility costs 

   during fiscal 2004 we recorded restructuring costs of 107 million relating to our global consolidation of office space primarily in the united states and the united kingdom these costs included losses on operating leases and writedowns of related assets such as leasehold improvements resulting from abandoned office space during this same period we recorded reorganization benefits of 78 million resulting primarily from final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 

  during fiscal 2003 we recorded reorganization benefits of 19 million resulting from a decrease in certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 for additional information refer to footnote 3 restructuring and reorganization benefits costs to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

   operating income was 1759 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 207 million or 13 over fiscal 2003 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements remained flat at 13 in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 

  operating income for each of the operating groups was as follows 

 56     restructuring costs and reorganization benefits were allocated to the reportable operating groups as follows 

   excluding the effects of reorganization and restructuring operating income in fiscal 2004 increased by 256 million over fiscal 2003 reflecting increases in communications  high tech financial services government and resources which were partially offset by a decrease in products the following commentary excludes the effects of reorganization and restructuring 

 

   interest income was 60 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 19 million or 46 over fiscal 2003 the increase resulted primarily from the increase in our average cash and investment balances during fiscal 2004 compared with the average balances for fiscal 2003 

   other income was less than 1 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 32 million in fiscal 2003 primarily resulting from lower foreign currency exchange gains 

   the effective tax rates for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were 320 and 351 respectively the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2004 resulted primarily from a reduction in valuation allowances changes in our geographic distribution of income and the tax effect of a reduction in reorganization 

57   liabilities the decrease in reorganization liabilities in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 reduced the annual effective tax rate by 15 and 04 percentage points respectively the decrease in reorganization liabilities had the effect of increasing pretax income in fiscal 2004 without a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes 

   minority interest was 532 million in fiscal 2004 a decrease of 16 million or 3 from fiscal 2003 primarily due to a reduction in the minority’s average ownership interests to 43 at august 31 2004 from 52 at the beginning of fiscal 2004 

   diluted earnings per share were 122 in fiscal 2004 compared with 105 in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to higher operating income the fiscal 2004 restructuring costs relating to our global consolidation of office space had the effect of reducing diluted earnings per share by 007 and the net reorganization benefit had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 008 in fiscal 2003 the net reorganization benefit had the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share by 002 

liquidity and capital resources 

  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves we may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to 

   at august 31 2005 cash and cash equivalents of 2484 million combined with 701 million of liquid fixedincome securities that are classified as investments on our consolidated balance sheet totaled 3185 million compared with 3154 million at august 31 2004 an increase of 31 million 

  cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized in the following table 

 58     operating activities the 131 million increase in cash provided in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net income an increase in accounts payable and 50 million in discretionary contributions to our us employees’ pension plans in fiscal 2005 compared to 230 million in fiscal 2004 partially offsetting increases in cash provided by operations were variable compensation payments of 263 million made in fiscal 2005 compared to 41 million in fiscal 2004 and an increase in net client balances receivables from clients current and noncurrent unbilled services and deferred revenues due primarily to growth in revenues and an increase in total client financing see below the 212 million increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued payroll and related benefits income taxes payable and other accrued liabilities which was partly offset by an increase in net client balances and an increase in other current assets 

  investing activities the 322 million decrease in cash used in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by the acquisition of the net assets of capgemini’s north american health practice for 179 million in cash including 4 million of acquisition expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the 789 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities and increased capital spending on property and equipment partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of investments during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 we invested 318 million 282 million and 212 million respectively in capital expenditures primarily for technology assets furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements to support our operations we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately 450 million in fiscal 2006 

  financing activities the 689 million increase in cash used in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by an increase of net purchases of common shares in fiscal 2005 partly offset by a net decrease in restricted cash of the predecessor to the accenture share employee compensation trust contributing to the 165 million increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was an increase in net share repurchases in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 which was partly offset by a contract termination payment in fiscal 2003 and a net decrease in restricted cash of the predecessor to the accenture share employee compensation trust 

borrowing facilities 

  at august 31 2005 we had the following borrowing facilities including the issuance of letters of credit to support general working capital purposes

   the increase in client financing from august 31 2004 was primarily due to client financing balance increases on the nhs contracts 

   from time to time accenture purchases accenture ltd class a common shares through the company’s openmarket purchase program and also purchases redeems and exchanges accenture shares held by partners former partners and their permitted transferees accenture also purchases certain accenture ltd class a common shares awarded to employees pursuant to restricted share units issued in connection with our initial public offering

  in july 2005 we implemented a senior executive trading policy applicable to our senior executives which provides among other things that all accenture ltd class a common shares accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares covered by the transfer restrictions contained in our various charter documents and available for transfer will be subject to quarterly trading guidelines these guidelines seek to limit the total number of these shares redeemed sold or otherwise transferred in any calendar quarter to no more than a composite average weekly volume of trading in accenture ltd class a common shares as of october 24 2005 the shares covered by the transfer restrictions contained in our various charter documents and subject to these additional quarterly guidelines represented approximately 55 of the total number of shares covered by the transfer restrictions contained in our various charter documents the senior executive trading policy was implemented in part due to the expiration on july 24 2005 of our share management plan for partners and the charter provisions we used to facilitate that plan since july 24 2005 holders of shares covered by the transfer restrictions contained in our various charter documents have been able to individually execute sales redemptions or dispositions of those shares that are free of transfer restrictions and in the case of our senior executives in compliance with the quarterly trading guidelines contained in the senior executive trading policy we intend to continue to redeem or purchase all accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc exchangeable shares offered for redemption or purchase for cash

61   

   in fiscal 2005 we continued to redeem or purchase certain accenture sca class i common shares in isolated transactions in accordance with the redemption provisions of accenture sca’s articles of association or in purchase transactions on comparable terms funds used in these transactions did not reduce other specific authorizations made by the board of directors of accenture ltd for various share purchase or reduction activities these transactions occurred outside of our share management plan and consisted primarily of redemptions or purchases of shares held by the beneficiaries and estates of deceased partners and to a lesser extent by charitable foundations during fiscal 2005 2 million was used for these purposes after the expiration of our share management plan on july 24 2005 all future redemptions and purchases of accenture sca class i common shares from partners former partners and their permitted transferees from whatever source will reduce the amount of funds authorized and available for such purposes 

subsequent developments 

  on september 14 2005 accenture sca and one of its subsidiaries made a tender offer to accenture sca class i common shareholders that resulted in the redemption and purchase effective as of october 14 2005 of an aggregate of 35922744 accenture sca class i common shares at a price of 2150 per share the total cash outlay for these transactions was 772 million 

  on october 6 2005 accenture ltd declared a cash dividend of 030 per share on its class a common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 17 2005 accenture ltd will cause accenture sca to declare a cash dividend of 030 per share on its class i common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on october 12 2005 both dividends are to be payable on november 15 2005 

   as of august 31 2005 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

 

   we have various agreements by which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters generally these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified 

62   party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract furthermore our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement historically the company has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate as of august 31 2005 we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments 

  from time to time accenture enters into contracts with clients whereby it has joint and several liability with other participants and third parties providing related services and products to the client under these arrangements accenture and other parties may assume some responsibility to the client for the performance of others under the terms and conditions of the contract with or for the benefit of the client to date accenture has not been required to make any payments under any of the contracts described in this paragraph for further discussion of these transactions please see footnote 15 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data” 

newly issued accounting standard 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 123r sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” this statement is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas no 123” and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance sfas no 123r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions the statement requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules sfas no 123r is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 

  accenture adopted sfas no 123r on september 1 2005 using the statement’s modified prospective application method adoption of sfas no 123r will not affect accenture’s total cash flows or financial position but it will reduce reported income and earnings per share because accenture currently uses the intrinsic value method as permitted by opinion no 25 accordingly no compensation expense is currently recognized for share purchase rights granted under the company’s employee stock option and employee share purchase plans 

  specifically adopting sfas no 123r will result in accenture recording compensation expense for employee stock options and employee share purchase rights had accenture expensed employee stock options and employee share purchase rights under sfas no 123 for the year ended august 31 2005 the following reported items would have been reduced income before income taxes by 218 million income before minority interest by 152 million net income by 98 million and 

63   diluted earnings per share by 016 we expect to increase the use of restricted share units and reduce the use of stock options in our employee incentive awards for fiscal 2006 resulting in total stockbased compensation expense that is comparable to fiscal 2005 pro forma expense 

  in addition on september 1 2005 upon adoption of sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application method accenture recognized an immaterial onetime pretax gain representing the reversal of compensation costs recorded in prior years for restricted share units that are not expected to vest due to future forfeitures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes therefore all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 

foreign currency risk 

  we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward andor option contracts with the euro accounting for a significant portion of the notional amount being hedged these instruments are generally shortterm in nature with typical maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk from time to time we enter into forward or option contracts of a longterm nature credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 

  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the foreign currency exchange risk is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure as of august 31 2005 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of 19 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of 19 million as of august 31 2004 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of 179 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of 179 million 

interest rate risk 

  the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at august 31 2005 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments 

equity price risk 

  the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  accenture’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

   due to its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  there has been no significant change in accenture ltd’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect accenture ltd’s internal control over financial reporting 

  as of september 1 2004 we transitioned certain of our business and financial systems to new platforms the implementation of these platforms as of september 1 2004 represents a culmination of more than a year of preparation testing and training implementation of the new systems necessarily involves changes to our procedures for control over financial reporting management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believes that throughout this implementation process we have maintained internal financial controls sufficient to ensure appropriate internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2005

  prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001 we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners in connection with our transition to a corporate structure our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for accenture ltd class a common shares or in the case of partners in certain countries accenture sca class i common shares or exchangeable shares issued by accenture canada holdings inc “accenture canada holdings” an indirect subsidiary of accenture sca generally partners who received accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of accenture ltd class x common shares which entitle their holders to vote at accenture ltd shareholders’ meetings but do not carry any economic rights   each class a common share and each class x common share of accenture ltd entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of accenture ltd the holder of a class x common share is not however entitled to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of accenture ltd   accenture ltd may at its option redeem any class x common share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the class x common share or 00000225 per share accenture ltd has separately agreed not to redeem any class x common share of a holder if such redemption would reduce the number of class x common shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of accenture sca class i common shares or accenture canada holdings exchangeable shares held by that holder as the case may be accenture ltd will redeem accenture ltd class x common shares upon redemption or exchange of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of class x common shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings exchangeable shares outstanding for example see “certain transactions — accenture ltd voting agreement”   each class i common share and each class ii common share of accenture sca entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of accenture sca each accenture sca class ii common share entitles accenture ltd to receive a dividend or liquidation payment equal to 10 of any dividend or liquidation payment to which an accenture sca class i common share entitles its holder accenture ltd holds all of the class ii common shares of accenture sca   subject to contractual transfer restrictions accenture sca is obligated at the option of the holder to redeem any outstanding accenture sca class i common share at any time at a redemption price per share generally equal to the market price of an accenture ltd class a common share at the time of the redemption accenture sca may at its option pay this redemption price with cash or by delivering accenture ltd class a common shares on a oneforone basis this oneforone redemption price and exchange ratio will be adjusted if accenture ltd holds more than a de minimis amount of assets other than its interest in accenture sca and assets it holds only transiently prior to contributing them to accenture sca or incurs more than a de minimis amount of liabilities other than liabilities for which accenture sca has a corresponding liability to accenture ltd we have been advised by our legal advisors in luxembourg that there is no relevant legal precedent in luxembourg quantifying or defining the term “de minimis” in the event that a question arises in this 12 regard we expect that management will interpret “de minimis” in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time in question at this time accenture ltd does not intend to hold any material assets other than its interest in accenture sca or to incur any material liabilities such that this oneforone redemption price and exchange ratio would require adjustment and will disclose any change in its intentions that could affect this ratio in order to maintain accenture ltd’s economic interest in accenture sca accenture ltd generally will acquire additional accenture sca common shares each time additional accenture ltd class a common shares are issued 

  subject to contractual transfer restrictions holders of accenture canada holdings exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for accenture ltd class a common shares at any time on a oneforone basis accenture may at its option satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an accenture ltd class a common share at the time of the exchange each exchangeable share of accenture canada holdings entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an accenture ltd class a common share entitles its holder employees   our most important asset is our people we are deeply committed to the development of our employees each professional receives extensive and focused technical and managerial skills development training appropriate to his or her career with us we seek to reinforce our employees’ commitments to our clients culture and values through a comprehensive performance review system and a competitive career philosophy that rewards individual performance and teamwork we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our historic partnership culture and the collaboration motivation alignment of interests and sense of ownership and reward that this partnership culture has fostered   as of august 31 2004 we had more than 100000 employees worldwide currently approximately 2300 of our employees are partners competition   we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services competitive with those we offer our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive basis in addition a client may choose to use its own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide our competitors include global information technology service firms offering a full range of consulting and outsourcing services as well as consulting services firms information technology services providers and application service providers additionally customers in the markets we serve continue to be receptive to engaging smaller service providers with numerous geographic service or industryspecific niches   our revenues are derived primarily from fortune global 500 and fortune 1000 companies mediumsized companies governmental organizations and other large enterprises we believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include  13  intellectual property   our success has resulted in part from our proprietary methodologies software reusable knowledge capital assets and other intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as upon trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property we have promulgated policies related to confidentiality and ownership and to the use and protection of our intellectual property and that owned by third parties and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate   we recognize the value of intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously create harvest and protect our intellectual property at august 31 2004 we had 1049 patent applications pending in the united states and other jurisdictions and had been issued 151 us patents and 50 nonus patents in among others the following areas goalbased educational simulation virtual call centers hybrid telecommunications networks development architecture frameworks emotionbased voice processing mobile communications networks locationbased information filtering and computerized multimedia asset systems we intend to continue to vigorously identify create harvest and protect our intellectual property risk factors risks that relate to our business 

 

   uncertain global economic and political conditions continue to affect many of our clients’ businesses in addition our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and consequently the benefits of any economic recovery to our business may take longer to realize deterioration of global economic or political conditions could increase these effects 

 

   our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement management consulting technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace also services solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete any one of these 14 circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 

  our business is also dependent in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers the growth in the use of technology slows down in challenging economic environments there is currently no significant new technology wave to stimulate spending use of new technology for commerce generally requires the understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may make some of their existing personnel processes and infrastructures obsolete 

 

   as a professional services firm we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highcaliber professional services and integrity to attract and retain clients as a result if a client is not satisfied with our services or solutions including those of subcontractors we employ it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses negative publicity related to our client relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or fail to disclose our financial or other arrangements with our alliance partners we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships our exposure may be increased in the case of outsourcing contracts in which we become more involved in our clients’ operations our contracts typically include provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the solutions we develop but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 

 

   unexpected costs delay s or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions could make our contracts unprofitable we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types when making proposals for engagements we estimate the costs and timing for completing the projects while the risks associated with all of these types of contracts are often similar an increasing number of outsourcing contracts entail the coordination of operations diverse geographic and competency workforces and geographically distributed service centers which further complicates the delivery of our services and increases the magnitude of these risks on outsourcing engagements we frequently hire employees from our clients and assume responsibility for one or more of our clients’ business processes our pricing cost and profit margin estimates on outsourcing engagements frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the outsourcing engagement these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our clients’ costs as well as the efficiencies of our methodologies and professionals as we plan to deploy them on projects any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin   under many of our contracts the payment of some or all of our fees is conditioned upon our performance we are increasingly moving away from contracts that are priced solely on a timeandmaterials basis and toward contracts that also include incentives related to factors such as costs 15 incurred benefits produced goals attained and adherence to schedule for example we are entering into an increasing number of outsourcing contracts including business transformation outsourcing contracts under which payment of all or a portion of our fees is contingent upon our clients meeting revenueenhancement costsaving or other contractually defined goals that are increasing in complexity and often dependent in some measure on our clients’ actual levels of business activity we estimate that a majority of our contracts have some fixedprice incentivebased or other pricing terms that condition some or all of our fees on our ability to deliver these defined goals the trend to include greater incentives in our contracts related to additional revenues generated costs incurred benefits produced or our adherence to schedule may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts 

  our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice our clients typically retain us on a nonexclusive engagementbyengagement basis rather than under exclusive longterm contracts a majority of our consulting engagements are less than 12 months in duration while our accounting systems identify the duration of our engagements these systems do not track whether contracts can be terminated upon short notice and without penalty however we estimate that the majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant penalty the advance notice of termination required for contracts of shorter duration and lower revenues is typically 30 days longerterm larger and more complex contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and may include an early termination charge to be paid to us additionally large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client changes in client strategies or the economy generally when contracts are terminated we lose the associated revenues and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods may be lower than expected   we may fail to collect amounts extended to clients in limited circumstances we extend financing to our clients which we may fail to collect a client must meet established criteria to receive financing from us and any significant extension of credit requires approval by senior levels of our management we had extended 455 million of such financing at august 31 2004 

 

   we have offices in 48 countries around the world in fiscal 2004 approximately 45 of our revenues before reimbursements were attributable to our activities in the americas 48 were attributable to our activities in europe the middle east and africa and 7 were attributable to our activities in the asia pacific region as a result we are subject to a number of risks including  16  

 

   the pace of consolidation among our competitors including vertical integration of hardware and software vendors and service providers continues some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with bettercapitalized partners larger and bettercapitalized competitors have enhanced abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals in addition one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting their profit margins   historically we have not relied to any material degree on mergers or acquisitions to increase our market share revenues number of market offerings or scope of services we intend to consider acquisitions that are financially and operationally compatible with our business our limited experience with mergers and acquisitions could affect our ability to efficiently consummate andor integrate acquisitions into our ongoing operations any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin or our ability to grow our business 

 

   our success and ability to grow are dependent in part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and grow our business the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious negative effect on us including our ability to obtain and successfully complete important client engagements and thus maintain or increase our revenues   we continue to offer a variable component of compensation the payment of which is dependent upon our performance to larger proportions of our global workforce we are increasing the use of equitybased incentives as a component of our executives’ compensation which may affect amounts of cash compensation we are also adjusting our compensation levels and adopting different methods of compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of employees with the diverse skills we need to serve clients grow our business and motivate these employees’ performance any of these actions could adversely affect our operating margins   additionally our partners at the time of our transition to a corporate structure received our equity in lieu of the interests in the partnerships and corporations that they previously held their ownership of this equity is not dependent upon their continued employment there is no guarantee that the noncompetition agreements we have entered into with our partners are sufficiently broad to prevent them from leaving us for our competitors or other opportunities or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases 17 

 

   our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization rate or chargeability of our professionals accordingly if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals without corresponding cost reductions our profit margin and our profitability will suffer a continuation of current pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including    our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors including    our profitability is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as the continuation of current pricing pressures could result in permanent changes in pricing policies and delivery capabilities we must continuously improve our management of costs our shortterm cost reduction initiatives which focus primarily on reducing variable costs may not be sufficient to deal with all pressures on our pricing and utilization rates our longterm cost reduction initiatives which focus on global reductions in infrastructure and other costs rely upon our successful introduction and coordination of multiple geographic and competency workforces and a growing number of geographically distributed delivery centers as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategies for growth we may not be able to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces control our costs or improve our efficiency   despite increased cost savings we may continue to experience erosion of operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements if present trends continue 18 

 

   our quarterly revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter making them difficult to predict this may lead to volatility in our share price the factors that are likely to cause these variations are  

 

   we continue to achieve a greater percentage of our revenues and growth through business transformation outsourcing our approach that combines outsourcing with our other capabilities to help clients transform and outsource key processes applications and infrastructure to improve business performance this strategy could result in higher concentrations of revenues and contributions to income from a smaller number of larger clients on customized outsourcing solutions or in the case of our bpo businesses from larger portfolios of clients for whom we provide similar services and solutions utilizing standard operating models   outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year as our outsourcing 19 business continues to grow we may experience increased pressure on our overall gross margins particularly during the early stages of these contracts 

 

   some engagements are complex and may require unique structures and alliances we will continue to manage liabilities or risks on such engagements through rigorous transaction review but we expect that clients may increasingly demand that we assume certain additional contractual obligations and potential but reimbursable liabilities for the performance of our business partners whom we do not control 

 

   if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our reputation financial results and the market price of our stock could suffer while we believe that we have adequate internal control procedures in place we may be exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal controls and have those controls attested to by their independent auditors we are evaluating our internal control systems in order to allow our management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to our internal controls as required as part of annual report on form 10k beginning with our report for the fiscal year ending august 31 2005   there is at present no precedent available with which to measure compliance adequacy accordingly there can be no assurance that we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely fashion or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls our reputation financial results and the market price of our stock could suffer   we may experience difficulties in implementing new business and financial systems on september 1 2004 we transitioned certain of our business and financial systems to new platforms although the transition to date has proceeded without material adverse consequences the process of implementing new systems could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations and financial condition any such disruption could affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause harm to our reputation 

 

   the united states congress recently passed and the president has signed legislation relating to the tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions we do not believe this legislation applies to accenture however we are not able to predict with certainty whether the us internal revenue service will challenge our interpretation of the legislation nor are we able to predict with certainty the impact of regulations or other interpretations that might be issued related to this legislation it is possible that certain interpretations could materially increase our tax burden 20   other legislative proposals related to certain foreign corporations have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the united states none of which adversely affects accenture additional legislative proposals remain under consideration in various legislatures which if enacted could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future   in addition there have been from time to time negative comments in the media regarding companies incorporated in bermuda this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of a negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our clients receiving negative media attention from doing business with us 

 

   we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions historically in our contracts we have generally agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we may not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms 

 

   our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights the steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights   depending on the circumstances we may be required to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed in connection with an engagement than we otherwise generally do in which case we would seek to crosslicense the use of the intellectual property however in very limited situations we forego rights to the use of intellectual property we help create which limits our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

 

   our alliances are an important component of our growth strategy if these relationships do not succeed we may fail to obtain the benefits we hope to derive from these endeavors similarly we may be adversely affected by the failure of one or more of our alliances which could lead to reduced 21 marketing exposure diminished sales and a decreased ability to develop and gain access to solutions as most of our alliance relationships are nonexclusive our alliance partners are not prohibited from forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors poor performance or failures of our alliances could have a material adverse impact on our growth strategy which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

risks that relate to ownership of our class a common shares 

 

   as of october 29 2004 our partners owned or controlled shares representing in the aggregate a 35 voting interest in accenture ltd these shares are subject to a voting agreement which requires our partners to vote as a group with respect to all matters submitted to shareholders our partners’ voting interest in accenture ltd may increase to the extent additional employees we name as partners are required to become parties to the voting agreement andor our partners receive additional equity   as long as our partners continue to own or control a significant block of voting rights they may effectively control us this may enable them without the consent of the other shareholders to    furthermore as a result of a partner matters agreement our partners will continue to have influence with respect to a variety of matters over which neither shareholders nor employees of a public company typically have input under the partner matters agreement our partners    under the terms of the partner matters agreement a partners’ income committee consisting of the chief executive officer and partners he or she appoints reviews evaluations and recommendations concerning the performance of partners and determines relative levels of income participation or unit allocation based upon its review the committee prepares a partners’ income plan which then must be submitted to the partners in a partner matters vote if the plan is approved by a 66 23 partner matters vote it is 1 binding with respect to the income participation or unit allocation of all partners other than the principal executive officers of accenture ltd including the chief executive officer subject to the impact on overall unit allocation of determinations by the board of directors or 22 the compensation committee of the board of directors of accenture ltd of the unit allocation for the executive officers unless otherwise determined by the board of directors and 2 submitted to the compensation committee of the board of directors of accenture ltd as a recommendation with respect to the income participation or unit allocation of the chief executive officer and the other principal executive officers of accenture ltd 

 

   sales of substantial amounts of accenture ltd class a common shares or the perception of these sales may adversely affect the price of the class a common shares and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future a substantial number of class a common shares are eligible for future sale as described below  23       24 

 

   we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to    any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute shareholders’ ownership percentage in us furthermore any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

 

   we are organized under the laws of bermuda and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda or in countries other than in the united states where we have assets based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda similarly those judgments may not be enforceable in countries other than in the united states where we have assets 

 

   our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states as a bermuda company we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including the provisions relating to interested directors mergers and acquisitions takeovers shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors   under bermuda law the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances officers of a bermuda company must in exercising their powers and performing their duties act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a 25 reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his duties to that company he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his conduct and the loss suffered 










 item 2 properties   we have major offices in the world’s leading business centers including new york chicago dallas los angeles san francisco boston london frankfurt madrid milan paris sydney and tokyo in total we have more than 110 offices in 48 countries around the world we do not own any material real property substantially all of our office space is leased under longterm leases with varying expiration dates we believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future 




 item 3 legal proceedings   we are involved in a number of judicial and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect that any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition   as previously reported in july 2003 we became aware of an incident of possible noncompliance with the foreign corrupt practices act andor with accenture’s internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in the middle east in 2003 we voluntarily reported the incident to the appropriate authorities in the united states promptly after its discovery shortly thereafter the sec advised us it would be undertaking an informal investigation of this incident and the us department of justice indicated it would also conduct a review since that time there have been no further developments we do not believe that this incident will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition   we currently maintain the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which we operate including coverage for professional liability general liability and management liability we consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the risks and amounts for the businesses we conduct

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend price range of accenture ltd class a common shares   trading in the accenture ltd class a common shares commenced on the new york stock exchange on july 19 2001 under the symbol “acn”   the table below sets forth on a per share basis for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for the class a common shares as reported by the new york stock exchange    the closing sale price of the accenture ltd class a common shares as reported by the new york stock exchange consolidated tape as of october 29 2004 was 2421 as of october 29 2004 there were 3222 holders of record of the class a common shares   there is no trading market for the accenture ltd class x common shares as of october 29 2004 there were 1452 holders of record of the class x common shares dividend policy   neither accenture ltd nor accenture sca has paid any cash dividends we currently do not anticipate that accenture ltd or accenture sca will pay dividends in fiscal 2005   we may from time to time enter into financing agreements that contain financial covenants and restrictions some of which may limit the ability of accenture ltd and accenture sca to pay dividends   future dividends on the accenture ltd class a common shares if any will be at the discretion of the board of directors of accenture ltd and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements and surplus financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant 29 recent sales of unregistered securities   none   information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans can be found on page 65 of this annual report on form 10k at “equity compensation plan information” repurchases of common stock   the following table provides information relating to the company’s purchase of common shares for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 for further discussion of the company’s share purchase activity including the purchase and redemption of accenture sca class i common shares by the company’s subsidiaries see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources”   30 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion and analysis also contains forwardlooking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in the sections of this annual report on form 10k entitled “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors”   we use the terms “accenture” “we” “our company” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to accenture ltd and its subsidiaries all references to years unless otherwise noted refer to our fiscal year which ends on august 31 for example a reference to “fiscal 2004” or “fiscal year 2004” means the 12month period that ended on august 31 2004 all references to quarters unless otherwise noted refer to the quarters of our fiscal year overview   revenues are driven by the ability of our partners and other senior executives to secure contracts for new engagements and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver marketleading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis   our results of operations are also affected by the economic conditions levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve our business is also driven in part by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients the ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance while there continue to be no indications of a significant new wave of technology to stimulate spending the strengthening economic recovery is beginning to affect the patterns of technology investment of many companies as a result growthoriented business initiatives are again competing with costcutting strategies revenue growth rates across our segments may be subject to more variability from quarter to quarter during fiscal 2005 as the economic recovery continues to take hold at different rates in different industrial and geographic markets   revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2004 were 1367 billion compared with 1182 billion for fiscal 2003 an increase of 16 in us dollars and 9 in local currency revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 342 billion compared with 302 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 an increase of 13 in us dollars and 10 in local currency   we continue to achieve an increasing percentage of our revenues and growth through business transformation outsourcing our approach that combines outsourcing with our other capabilities to help clients transform and outsource key processes applications and infrastructure to improve business performance outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for fiscal 2004 were 508 billion representing an increase of 35 in us dollars and 28 in local currency terms over fiscal 2003 outsourcing revenues before reimbursements for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 128 billion representing an increase of 17 in us dollars and 13 in local currency terms compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 outsourcing contracts typically have longer terms than consulting contracts and generally have lower gross margins than consulting contracts particularly in the first year while outsourcing will continue to deliver solid growth to our business it is likely to grow overall at a slower rate than it did in fiscal 2004 32   companies remain cautious about increasing their use of consulting services however we are beginning to see an upturn in demand for our consulting services as profit margins begin to recover and companies return to focusing on improving business performance for fiscal 2004 consulting revenues before reimbursements were 859 billion representing an increase of 7 in us dollars while remaining flat in local currency terms compared to fiscal 2003 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 consulting revenues before reimbursements were 214 billion representing an increase of 12 in us dollars and 8 in local currency terms over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003   we continue to experience ongoing pricing pressures from competitors as well as from clients facing pressure to control costs the pace of consolidation and of vertical integration among our competitors continues to increase and to affect our revenues and operating margins in addition the growing use of offshore resources to provide lowercost service delivery capabilities within our industry continues to be a source of pressure on our revenues and operating margins while we have recently experienced increases in demand for our services and while margins in our consulting business have recently stabilized it is too early to tell if these developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins over the long term   as a global company our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchangerate fluctuations the strengthening of various currencies versus the us dollar has resulted in favorable currency translation and increased our reported revenues operating expenses and operating income if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies the resulting unfavorable currency translation could lower reported us dollar revenues operating expenses and operating income and result in us dollar revenue growth lower than growth in local currency terms we do not expect favorable currency translations to continue to contribute to us dollar growth rates comparable to those experienced in fiscal 2004   the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services sales and marketing and general and administrative costs cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of clientservice personnel which consists mainly of compensation subcontractor and other personnel costs and nonpayroll outsourcing costs cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services the chargeability or utilization of our clientservice workforces and the level of nonpayroll costs associated with the continuing accelerated growth of new outsourcing contracts chargeability or utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable work sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by businessdevelopment activities the development of new service offerings the level of concentration of clients in a particular industry or market and clienttargeting imagedevelopment and brandrecognition activities general and administrative costs primarily include costs for nonclientfacing personnel information systems and office space which we seek to manage at levels consistent with changes in activity levels in our business   operating expenses include restructuring costs and reorganization benefits restructuring costs include costs incurred related to global consolidation of office space reorganization benefits result from final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with accenture’s transition to a corporate structure in 2001   gross margins revenues less cost of services for the three months and year ended august 31 2004 were 324 and 338 respectively of revenues before reimbursements compared with 344 and 365 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2003 these decreases resulted primarily from the continuing shift in our mix of business toward outsourcing and increased variable compensation expense and were partly offset by lower severance costs and higher consulting margins 33   our costmanagement strategy continues to be to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify costmanagement initiatives we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs to meet the anticipated demand for our services as operating expenses can be significantly affected by compensation and severance costs we continue to take actions to create a more variable cost structure while our chargeability levels are at or near alltime highs we continue to have supplyanddemand and skilllevel imbalances in certain industry segments andor countries   we continue to take actions to balance our mix of skills and resources to meet current and projected future demand in each of our markets and will use our global sourcing approach which includes our network of delivery centers and other capabilities around the world as part of our costeffective delivery model our headcount increased from approximately 83000 employees worldwide at august 31 2003 to more than 100000 employees as of august 31 2004 our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected if we do not effectively assimilate these new employees into our workforces we also continue to experience an aboveaverage attrition rate as global economic conditions continue to improve and the demand for talent in certain markets increases as a result of the substantial numbers of new hires in our workforces our hiring and training costs may increase because our talent market is increasingly competitive we will need to respond accordingly during the course of the year in fiscal 2005 we will continue to adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of employees with the skills necessary to expand our business these additional costs and compensation adjustments could adversely affect our operating margins   as a result of our ongoing costmanagement initiatives and the continued shift in our mix of business toward outsourcing sales and marketing and general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to 21 for both the three months and year ended august 31 2004 respectively from 23 for the three months and year ended august 31 2003 operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements decreased to 11 for the three months ended august 31 2004 from 12 for the three months ended august 31 2003 primarily related to the decline in gross margins as described above operating income as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements remained flat at 13 in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 

 

   new contract bookings for the three months ended august 31 2004 were 4024 million an increase of 269 million or 7 from new bookings of 3755 million for the three months ended august 31 2003 with consulting bookings increasing 11 to 2262 million and outsourcing bookings increasing 2 to 1762 million for the year ended august 31 2004 bookings were 20116 million an increase of 25 over the year ended august 31 2003 with consulting bookings increasing 11 and outsourcing bookings increasing 39 we provide information regarding our bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time however the timing of large bookings can significantly affect the level of bookings in a particular quarter information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to nor should it be substituted for an analysis of our revenues over time   the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice accordingly we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog normally if a client terminates a project the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 34 

 

   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses our estimates judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition income taxes variable compensation and defined benefit pension plans 

 

   our contracts have different terms based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement the terms of which frequently require accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues we have many types of contracts including timeandmaterials contracts fixedprice contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types in addition there is a trend to include greater incentives in our contracts related to costs incurred benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable for technology integration contracts estimated revenues for applying the percentageofcompletion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable for nontechnology integration consulting and outsourcing contracts revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and when acceptance where applicable and delivery of agreed benefits have occurred in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” as amended by sab no 104 “revenue recognition”   we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentageofcompletion method pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified   outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery often through multiple workforces in different countries we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first identified circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputsoutputs on which we are paid failure to deliver agreed benefits variances from planned internalexternal costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs 35   revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the fair value of the elements fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a standalone basis fair value of the separate elements exists and in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control while determining fair value and identifying separate elements requires judgment generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements effective september 1 2003 we adopted emerging issues task force issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” as such for contracts signed after august 31 2003 revenues are allocated to each element based on the lesser of fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element if the amount of noncontingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become noncontingent   client prepayments even if nonrefundable are deferred ie classified as a liability and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed   our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the quarter which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays consequently since we typically have approximately five to ten percent more work days in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters our revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters   revenues before reimbursements include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts as well as revenues from alliance agreements neither of which is material to us reimbursements including those relating to travel and outofpocket expenses and other similar thirdparty costs such as the cost of hardware and software resales are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services 

 

   determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate   we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs our effective tax rate for the year ended august 31 2004 was 320 compared with 351 for the year ended august 31 2003 this decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in valuation allowances changes in our geographic mix of income and the tax effect of a reduction in reorganization liabilities   no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events including material changes in estimates of cash working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 36   as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the company owing additional taxes we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 

 

   we record compensation expense for payments to be made in later fiscal periods to our partners and other employees under the variable compensation portions of our overall compensation programs in fiscal 2004 we increased the variable component of target compensation for larger portions of our global workforce determining the amount of expense to recognize as operating expenses for variable compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment expenses accrued for variable compensation are based on actual quarterly and annual operational performance versus plan targets and other factors amounts accrued are subject to change in future periods if future performance is below plan targets or is below the performance levels anticipated in prior periods management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available the liability recorded at august 31 2004 for variable compensation was 280 million of which we expect to pay approximately 215 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 with the remainder payable in subsequent quarters provided performance targets are met the following table shows quarterly variable compensation expense benefit  

 

   in the united states and certain other countries accenture maintains and administers defined benefit pension plans the annual cost of these plans can be significantly affected by changes in assumptions and differences between expected and actual experience   our us pension plans include plans covering certain us employees and former employees as well as a frozen plan related to basic retirement benefits for former preincorporation partners the employee plans have a june 30 measurement date and at august 31 2004 had a projected benefit obligation of 566 million and assets of 596 million after taking into account 230 million in contributions made in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2005 no contribution will be required for the us employee pension plans we have not determined whether we will make additional voluntary contributions for us employee pension plans in fiscal 2005 the frozen plan for former partners is unfunded and has a projected benefit obligation of 126 million nonus pension plan obligations 37 totaled 336 million while pension assets totaled 243 million we contributed 29 million to nonus plans in fiscal 2004 and expect to contribute 39 million in fiscal 2005 

  pension expense was 122 million and 72 million for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively for fiscal 2005 pension expense is estimated to be approximately 113 million the fiscal 2005 pension expense estimate incorporates the 2005 assumptions and the impact of the increased pension plan assets resulting from our discretionary contributions of 230 million in fiscal 2004   key assumptions used to determine annual pension expense for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 are as follows    a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our annual pension expense by 11 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by 12 million   a 25 basis point increase in our return on plan assets would decrease our annual pension expense by 2 million a 25 basis point decrease in our return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by 2 million   our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations the assumptions assets and liabilities used to measure our annual pension expense are determined as of june 30 for the majority of our us benefit plans and as of august 31 for the majority of our nonus benefit plans since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate is a significant assumption it is based on interest rates for highquality longterm corporate debt at each measurement date our estimated us pension expense for fiscal 2005 reflects a 25 basis point increase in our discount rate from 600 to 625 this change in discount rate will decrease us pension expense in fiscal 2005 by approximately 7 million to develop the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio this resulted in the selection of the 750 longterm rate of return on assets assumption for our us plans for fiscal 2005 and represents a 50 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets from the 800 used in fiscal 2004 our estimated nonus pension expense incorporates a 47 basis point reduction in the weighted average expected return on plan assets from 566 to 519 the decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets will increase consolidated pension expense in fiscal 2005 by approximately 4 million the impacts of these types of changes on the pension plans in other countries will vary depending upon the status of each respective plan   statement of financial accounting standard no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” requires recognition of a minimum pension liability if the fair value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at august 31 2004 shareholders’ equity included a charge of 92 million representing a minimum pension liability of 153 million net of a tax benefit of 61 million additional charges to equity may be required in the future depending on future contributions to our pension plans returns on pension plan assets and interest rates 38 revenues by segment operating group   our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups which are communications  high tech financial services government products and resources operating groups are managed on the basis of revenues before reimbursements because our management believes these are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues from time to time our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain engagements the resulting revenues and costs from these engagements may be apportioned among the participating operating groups generally operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating segments affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating segments to differing degrees decisions relating to staffing levels are not made uniformly across our operating segments due in part to an increased need on behalf of some of our operating groups to tailor their workforces to the needs of their businesses the shift to outsourcing engagements is not uniform among our operating groups and consequently neither is the impact on operating group results caused by this shift local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses 39   the following tables provide revenues for each of our operating groups geographic regions and types of work for the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2004 and 2003 and for fiscal years 2004 and 2003  40     the company conducts business in two countries that individually comprised more than 10 of consolidated revenues before reimbursements within the last three years the united states represented 39 43 and 46 of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively while the united kingdom totaled 16 14 and 14 for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively revenues are attributed to countries based on where client services are supervised year ended august 31 2004 compared to year

increase of 23 in us dollars and 10 in local currency this increase was primarily due to strong growth in 41 the united kingdom france and spain as well as the strengthening of the pound sterling and euro against the us dollar 

  in our americas region fiscal 2004 revenues before reimbursements were 6133 million compared with 5671 million for fiscal 2003 an increase of 8 in us dollars and 7 in local currency a key contributor to this growth was our canadian business where revenues before reimbursements grew 52 in us dollars over fiscal 2003 this growth was partially offset by items mentioned below with respect to our communications  high tech government and resources operating groups that were primarily concentrated in our americas region   our asia pacific region had fiscal 2004 revenues before reimbursements of 968 million compared with 794 million for fiscal 2003 an increase of 22 in us dollars and 12 in local currency this increase was largely driven by strong growth in our business in japan and australia   our communications  high tech operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 3741 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 14 over fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased outsourcing revenues consulting revenues and favorable currency translation also contributed to increased revenues over fiscal 2003 outsourcing revenues benefited from strong revenue growth with our communications and electronics  high tech industry groups in the americas and europe consulting revenues benefited from growth in europe latin america and asia pacific slightly offset by a decline in north america operating group revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 8 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increased consulting revenues in all geographies and favorable currency translation this increase was partially offset by lower outsourcing revenues in north america due partly to a substantial reduction in the scope of our work with a major telecommunications client as a result of that client’s changing business strategies this reduction may continue to affect outsourcing revenues for the next several quarters   our financial services operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2771 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 18 over fiscal 2003 results were primarily driven by strong growth in outsourcing revenues higher consulting revenues and favorable currency translation revenue growth in our banking and insurance industry groups particularly in the united kingdom contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues consulting revenues benefited from the continued economic recovery of clients in our capital markets industry group operating group revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 25 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increased consulting revenues in our capital markets industry group and growth in outsourcing revenues particularly in emea   our government operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 1995 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 26 over fiscal 2003 results were primarily driven by strong growth in both outsourcing and consulting revenues in addition to favorable currency translation revenue growth with european clients particularly in the united kingdom and with clients in the asia pacific region contributed to increased consulting revenues which were partially offset by decreased revenues from clients in the united states outsourcing revenue growth benefited from increased revenues in all geographic regions in particular with the us federal government operating group revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 13 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased revenues in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region   our products operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2979 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 14 from fiscal 2003 primarily driven by increased outsourcing revenues consulting revenues and favorable currency translation also contributed to increased revenues over fiscal 2003 a majority of our industry groups particularly the retail  consumer and the 42 pharmaceuticals  medical products industry groups contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues consulting revenues increased primarily due to growth in our asia pacific region revenues as well as growth in our automotive and health services industry groups in all geographies consulting revenue growth was partially offset by decreased revenues in our transportation  travel services industry group particularly in emea revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 17 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increased outsourcing revenues in our pharmaceuticals  medical products and retail  consumer industry groups as well as consulting growth in our retail  consumer industry group 

  our resources operating group achieved revenues before reimbursements of 2178 million in fiscal 2004 an increase of 11 from fiscal 2003 as increases in our outsourcing revenues and a favorable currency translation more than offset the slight decrease in consulting revenues all industry groups in resources in particular utilities contributed to the growth in outsourcing revenues the euro and pound sterling contributed to the favorable currency translation consulting revenue growth in our energy metals  mining and utilities industry groups was offset by a decrease in our chemicals and forest products industry group revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 revenues before reimbursements for resources grew 5 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 primarily reflecting outsourcing revenue growth in our utilities energy metals  mining and forest products industry groups as well as growth in our accenture business services for utilities bpo business consulting revenues remained flat with increases in our energy metals  mining and forest products industry groups offset by decreases in our chemicals and utilities industry groups operating expenses   operating expenses in fiscal 2004 were 13355 million an increase of 1509 million or 13 over fiscal 2003 and represented 88 of revenues in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements operating expenses before reimbursable expenses also remained flat at 87 in both fiscal years 2004 and 2003 in fiscal 2004 operating expenses included restructuring costs of 107 million relating to the company’s global consolidation of office space and a benefit of 78 million primarily resulting from final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001 the restructuring cost of 107 million and reorganization benefit of 78 million increased operating expenses before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements by 02 percentage points the strengthening of various currencies against the us dollar increased reported operating expenses for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 partially offsetting corresponding increases in reported revenues   in fiscal 2004 we incurred severance costs of 111 million compared with 161 million of severance costs in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 we expensed 277 million for variable compensation compared with 11 million of variable compensation expense in fiscal 2003

   sales and marketing expense was 1458 million in fiscal 2003 a decrease of 107 million or 7 from fiscal 2002 reflecting a 55 million decrease in businessdevelopment and marketdevelopment costs and a 25 million decrease in variable compensation expense as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements sales and marketing expense decreased from 14 in fiscal 2002 to 12 in fiscal 2003

interest income   interest income was 41 million in fiscal 2003 a decrease of 5 million or 11 from fiscal 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from the impact of lower interest rates in fiscal 2003 interest expense   interest expense was 21 million in fiscal 2003 a decrease of 28 million or 57 from fiscal 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from lower imputed interest expense due to reductions in other longterm liabilities resulting from payments made to arthur andersen llp in october 2002 in conjunction with the termination of the service arrangements and facility use arrangement entered into in fiscal 2001 other income expense   other income was 32 million in fiscal 2003 an increase of 17 million over fiscal 2002 primarily resulting from an increase in currency exchange gains equity in losses of affiliates   equity in losses of affiliates totaled less than 1 million in fiscal 2003 compared with losses of 9 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to the consolidation of the investment in our avanade inc and accenture hr services subsidiaries beginning on january 1 2002 and march 1 2002 respectively which we previously accounted for under the equity method provision for income taxes   the effective tax rates for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were 351 and 460 respectively the 212 million charge to write down investments had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 by 80 percentage points the reduction in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to a reversal of previously accrued taxes following the favorable settlement of certain prioryear nonus income tax liabilities and lowerthanestimated nonus withholding tax requirements minority interest   minority interest was 548 million in fiscal 2003 an increase of 217 million or 65 over fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher income before minority interest the minority’s average ownership interests decreased from 53 at the beginning of fiscal 2003 to 52 at august 31 2003 earnings

current assets   net cash used in investing activities was 897 million in fiscal 2004 compared with 109 million of cash used in investment activities in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to

that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions we do not believe this legislation applies to accenture however we are not able to predict with certainty whether the us internal revenue service will challenge our interpretation of the legislation nor are we able to predict with certainty the impact of regulations or other interpretations that might be issued related to this legislation it is possible that certain interpretations could materially increase our tax burden obligations and commitments   as of august 31 2004 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts contractual obligations and commercial commitments   53 offbalance sheet arrangements   we have various agreements by which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters generally these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract furthermore our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement historically the company has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate as of august 31 2004 we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments   from time to time accenture enters into contracts with clients whereby it has joint and several liability with other participants and third parties providing related services and products to the client under these arrangements accenture and other parties may assume some responsibility to the client for the performance of others under the terms and conditions of the contract with or for the benefit of the client to date accenture has not been required to make any payments under any of the contracts described in this paragraph for further discussion of these transactions please see footnote 16 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements below under “financial statements and supplementary data” newly issued accounting standards   in may 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position “fsp” 1062 “accounting and disclosure

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency risk   we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business we hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward andor option contracts these instruments are generally shortterm in nature with typical maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk from time to time we enter into forward or option contracts of a longterm nature credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties 54   we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio the foreign currency exchange risk is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure as of august 31 2004 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of 179 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of 179 million as of august 31 2003 a 10 decrease in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of 60 million while a 10 increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of 60 million interest rate risk   the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at august 31 2004 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows while we may do so in the future we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments equity price risk   the equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows
