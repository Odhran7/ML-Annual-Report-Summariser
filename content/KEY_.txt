competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bhcs commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global institutions that offer financial services some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures the financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry enabling more companies including nonbank companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition 

table of contents 

federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2021 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

table of contents 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier 1 capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period “regulatory capital rules” as of april 1 2020 the regulatory capital rules are fully phasedin for key consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2021 keycorp’s ratios under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules are set forth in the following table 

minimum capital ratios and keycorp ratios under 

regulatory capital rules 



a as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the 3 supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january 1 2018 

b stress capital buffer must consist of common equity tier 1 capital as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 25 imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the regulatory capital rules 

c ratios reflect the fiveyear transition of cecl impacts on regulatory ratios 

revised prompt corrective action framework 

the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prompt corrective action framework 

table of contents 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action framework 



a a “well capitalized” institution also must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 

b as a standardized approach banking organization keybank is not subject to the 3 supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january 1 2018 

we believe that as of december 31 2021 keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

recent regulatory capitalrelated developments 

in december 2017 the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets “rwas” and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by 1 enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk 2 constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk 3 introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and 4 replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach 

the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committee’s efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements 

subsequently in december 2018 the basel committee released an update to its pillar 3 disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committee’s final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar 3 disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december 2017 

on july 9 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations including key the final rule simplifies for these banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25 deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250 risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital the final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital in addition the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the regulatory capital rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule provided an effective date of october 1 2019 for the technical amendments and an effective date of april 1 2020 for the simplification changes on november 13 2019 the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification 

table of contents 

changes on either january 1 2020 or april 1 2020 we chose to implement the simplification changes on april 1 2020 

in november 2019 the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the regulatory capital rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate “hvcre” exposure hvcre exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the regulatory capital rules the final rule which became effective on april 1 2020 conforms the hvcre definition to statutory changes enacted in may 2018 the final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised hvcre definition of credit facilities that finance onetofour family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land 

a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in february 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on march 27 2020 the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under us accounting standards to adopt cecl before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years cecl’s adverse effects on regulatory capital “cecl interim final rule” this is in addition to the threeyear transition period already in place resulting in an optional fiveyear transition the agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the us economy caused by covid19 

the cares act enacted on march 27 2020 provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with cecl until the earlier of i the termination date of the national emergency concerning covid19 declared by the president under the national emergencies act or ii december 31 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a statement on march 31 2020 indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule after the end of the statutory relief period alternatively banking organizations may adopt cecl as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule starting at the time of their adoption of cecl 

on august 26 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the cecl interim final rule like the cecl interim final rule the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period which results in an optional fiveyear transition the final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional fiveyear transition to include any institution adopting cecl in 2020 the final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount key elected to adopt cecl as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a fiveyear transition to measure cecl’s effects on regulatory capital 

liquidity requirements 

us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules 

table of contents 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october 1 2018 

large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively “epss” including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa enacted on may 24 2018 raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from 50 billion to 250 billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhc’s or bhcs’ capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors 

in october 2019 the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa “tailoring rules” the final rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories “category iv firms” the tailoring rules became effective on december 31 2019 

in one of the tailoring rules the federal banking agencies amended various rules including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this final rule category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than 50 billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp does not meet the 50 billion threshold and is not subject to the reduced lcr or an lcr public disclosure requirement 

in the other tailoring rule the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards including liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firm’s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr 2052a liquidity reporting requirements 

on october 20 2020 the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the basel iii nsfr for us banking organizations the nsfr final rule which became effective on july 1 2021 requires certain banking organizations with more than 100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets commitments and derivatives exposures over a oneyear time horizon the final nsfr rule tailors the application of the nsfr requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions established by the tailoring rules key is a category iv firm category iv firms with average weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than 50 billion will not be subject to an nsfr requirement key does not meet the 50 billion threshold and is not subject to an nsfr requirement 

table of contents 

on december 1 2021 the federal reserve published revisions to the fr 2052a liquidity reporting form in order to accurately reflect the nsfr final rule and to capture other data elements necessary to monitor banking organizations’ liquidity positions and compliance with liquidity risk management standards the revisions will be effective on may 1 2022 for category i firms and on october 1 2022 for category ii iii and iv firms including keycorp 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 100 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with the bhc’s ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon 

the federal reserve’s ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

the federal reserve has conducted a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios and through 2018 an adverse scenario that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests through keycorp’s 2018 midcycle stress test results have been disclosed under the “regulatory disclosures  filings” section of the “financials” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir such summaries were not disclosed after 2018 because of the rule changes discussed below 

one of the tailoring rules issued by the federal reserve in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa changes the stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs that are category iv firms like keycorp under this rule category iv firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case in 2020 keycorp was required to participate in the federal reserve’s ccar process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve in 2022 keycorp will be required to participate in the federal reserve’s ccar process and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve 

a separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in october 2019 to implement a provision in egrrcpa that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federallyregulated banks to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from 10 billion to 250 billion in total consolidated assets under this final rule federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than 250 billion like keybank will no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the “adverse” scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only “baseline” and “severely adverse” scenarios 

on march 4 2020 the federal reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the federal reserve’s regulatory capital rules with ccar and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to bhcs that have 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp under the final rule the federal reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure 

table of contents 

the stress capital buffer which will be based on the results of an individual bhc’s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 25 percent of riskweighted assets a firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on october 1 of each year and will remain in effect until september 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve 

on march 20 2020 the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies’ regulatory capital rules the revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the federal reserve on march 4 2020 the revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress including the period of stress resulting from the covid19 pandemic on august 26 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts without change the interim final rule issued in march 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies’ regulatory capital rules 

in april 2020 we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the federal reserve under the federal reserve’s ccar process on june 25 2020 the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its ccar process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 bhcs having more than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020 the federal reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the covid19 disruptions 

as a result of its sensitivity analysis the federal reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and reevaluate their capital plans specifically the federal reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the appropriate reserve bank within 45 days after the federal reserve provides updated scenarios the federal reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020 these firms were prohibited from i making share repurchases other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans and ii paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the federal reserve the federal reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarterbyquarter depending upon the economic circumstances 

on june 30 2020 keycorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement provided by the federal reserve as part of the 2020 federal reserve capital stress testing exercise is 25 which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of key keycorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020 subject to approval by keycorp’s board of directors which the board subsequently approved on july 8 2020 on august 10 2020 the federal reserve confirmed keycorp’s stress capital requirement of 25 

on september 17 2020 the federal reserve announced three supervisory scenarios baseline severely adverse and alternative severe that firms subject to the federal reserve’s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the federal reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms the federal reserve stated that it planned to release firmspecific results from the firms’ performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020 

due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic the federal reserve announced on september 30 2020 that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience specifically the federal reserve stated that banking organizations with more than 100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020 

on december 18 2020 the federal reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that in the aggregate capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios however the federal reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty it was extending its limits 

table of contents 

on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021 with certain modifications the federal reserve said that these firms including keycorp 1 are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and 2 are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters the federal reserve further indicated that it could extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until march 31 2021 

on march 25 2021 the federal reserve said that it was continuing into the second quarter of 2021 the restrictions on dividends and share repurchases for bhcs with more than 100 billion in total assets that it announced on december 18 2020 and indicated that it was extending the time period for the federal reserve to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until june 30 2021 the federal reserve also announced that these temporary restrictions on bhc dividends and share repurchases would end for most firms after june 30 2021 firms subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test in 2021 with capital levels above those required by the stress test will no longer be subject to the temporary additional restrictions after that date while firms with capital levels below those required by the stress test will remain subject to the restrictions on june 24 2021 the federal reserve announced that all 23 firms that participated in the federal reserve’s 2021 supervisory stress test had capital levels above the required minimum and are no longer subject to the temporary additional restrictions on dividends and share repurchases 

for bhcs that are on a twoyear stress test cycle and were not subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test in 2021 including keycorp the temporary additional restrictions on dividends and share repurchases ended after june 30 2021 beginning on july 1 2021 these firms are allowed to make capital distributions that are consistent with the regulatory capital rules inclusive of the stress capital buffer requirement based on the firm’s june 2020 stress test in august 2020 the federal reserve confirmed that keycorp’s required stress capital buffer based on its june 2020 stress test is 25 which is the minimum buffer requirement for firms the size of keycorp in august 2021 the federal reserve reconfirmed that keycorp’s required stress capital buffer is 25 

on january 19 2021 the federal reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including keycorp to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the federal reserve adopted in an october 2019 rulemaking the final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that category iv firms are required to submit to the federal reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements also the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms in addition the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” in this report

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the bank’s ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 on july 16 2019 the fdic approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule among other things the amendments to this rule i provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than april 1 2021 upon notification to the fdic ii clarify the certification requirement iii revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a passthrough basis where the bank’s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds and iv streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the fdic 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

table of contents 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public sections of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank are available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans keycorp’s last resolution plan was submitted in 2017 and keybank’s last resolution plan was submitted in 2018 keycorp is no longer required to submit a resolution plan because of the rule change discussed below while keybank remains subject to resolution plan requirements as discussed below 

in october 2019 the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have 75 billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements 

on april 16 2019 the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas i creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size complexity and other factors ii revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions iii improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the fdic and institutions on resolutionrelated matters and iv revision of the 50 billion asset threshold in the current rule the fdic indicated 

table of contents 

that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements under each of these approaches institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan the fdic would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions comments on this anpr were due by june 21 2019 any changes to this rule will impact keybank the fdic extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed 

on january 19 2021 the fdic issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with 100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans the fdic said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues the fdic further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm 

on june 25 2021 the fdic issued a statement describing the modified approach that it plans to take in implementing certain aspects of its resolution plan rule with respect to idis with 100 billion or more in total assets including keybank in this statement the fdic i indicated that these institutions will be required to submit resolution plans on a threeyear cycle ii described the content requirements for these resolution plan submissions and iii specified that there will be greater emphasis in the future on periodic engagement and capabilities testing by the fdic with individual institutions a key goal of the fdic’s modified approach is to provide the fdic with the information that it will need to meet the operational challenges of resolving an institution in a way that best preserves value and minimizes disruptions the fdic stated that resolution plans will be submitted in two groups with the first group consisting of idis whose parent company is not a us global systemically important bank or a category ii banking organization and the second group consisting of all other idis with 100 billion or more in total assets keybank is in the first group 

other regulatory developments 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an aml program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a

banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note 6 “fair value measurements” in item 8 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 as of december 31 2021 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology 

on october 8 2019 five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the final rule i revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the volcker rule ii modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions iii adds additional proprietary trading exclusions and iv tailors the rule’s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm’s trading assets and liabilities under the final rule a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has “significant” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least 20 billion a banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between 1 billion and 20 billion is regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity’s activities size scope and complexity a presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with “limited” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than 1 billion the final rule rule became effective on january 1 2020 and the compliance date was january 1 2021 key has “moderate” trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule the final rule did not have a material impact on key’s operations 

on june 25 2020 five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fundrelated provisions of the volcker rule among other things the final rule i permits certain lowrisk transactions including intraday credit riskless principal and payment clearing and settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations small business investment companies and public welfare investment funds and iii permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address such as credit funds venture capital funds customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles the final rule became effective on october 1 2020 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

table of contents 

the resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2019 in 2011 the federal reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa which was enacted on may 24 2018 raised from 50 billion to 250 billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp also this statute requires the federal reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of bhcs with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least 50 billion 

on june 14 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

in one of the tailoring rules issued in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp believes that it is a category iv firm the least restrictive of these categories the tailoring rules are discussed further under the headings “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” and “regulatory capital requirements  capital planning and stress testing” 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

supervision and governance 

table of contents 

on november 2 2018 the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more like keycorp “lfi rating system” in order to align the federal reserve’s rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institution’s capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned initial ratings under the lfi rating system in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp 

the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system was the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors was published by the federal reserve on august 3 2017 the final guidance on this subject was issued by the federal reserve on february 26 2021 the final guidance describes the key attributes of effective boards of directors of large financial institutions including bhcs with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets this guidance adopts a principlesbased approach to describe attributes of effective boards of directors and provides illustrative examples of effective practices the federal reserve indicated that it intends to use the board effectiveness guidance in informing its assessment of governance and controls at all firms subject to the lfi rating system including keycorp 

on january 4 2018 the federal reserve released the final proposal related to the lfi rating system  the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm’s board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march 15 2018 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act “cra” was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome “lmi” neighborhoods consistent with the institutions’ safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods 

on may 20 2020 the occ issued a final rule the “2020 final rule” to revise the agency’s cra regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the occ assesses a bank’s cra performance the occ stated that it was doing so in order to make the cra regulatory framework more objective transparent consistent in application and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities particularly lmi neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved the final rule became effective on october 1 2020 certain provisions of the rule had compliance dates of january 1 2023 or january 1 2024 

on september 21 2020 the federal reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public comment on ways to modernize cra regulations by strengthening clarifying and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the cra the anpr seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of lmi communities and address inequities in credit access when it issued the anpr the federal reserve said that it hoped the anpr would provide a foundation for

on april 7 2020 the federal banking agencies in consultation with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between i their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to covid19 need to be treated as tdrs and ii the cares act provision on this subject in this interagency statement the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the covid19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action 

the federal reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households businesses and governments one of these facilities is the paycheck protection program liquidity facility “ppplf” which was set up to allow the federal reserve banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate ppp loans taking the loans as collateral at face value on april 9 2020 the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of ppp loans financed under the ppplf on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations on september 29 2020 the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule in addition on june 22 2020 the fdic issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of ppp lending on banks’ deposit insurance assessments also in accordance with the cares act a ppp loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies’ riskbased capital rules

table of contents 

agency policies and procedures and will consider whether a bank’s management has managed risk appropriately including taking appropriate actions in response to stresses caused by the covid19 pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the material risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

table of contents 

i credit risk 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 70 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than single family residential real estate loans and other types of consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of loans in this category could cause an increase in nonperforming loans which could result in lower earnings from these loans additional provision for loan and lease losses and ultimately an increase in loan losses 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

while the covid19 pandemic has impacted the commercial real estate market property values have largely resumed slow appreciation and in the case of multifamily and industrial now exceed prepandemic levels development and construction continue but at muted levels and deliveries of additional units into the market have been supported oversupply of multifamily housing is a concern in certain urban and gateway markets however our exposures in those markets are limited the most severely impacted commercial real estate segments have been in hospitality office and retail however monthly collections have improved key’s nonowner occupied office and retail exposures are 14 of our total commercial real estate exposure substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could negatively impact our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate but in the higher performing multifamily space a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans or to refinance the loans at maturity a relatively small portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans new construction and valueadd or rehabilitation construction projects are not fully leased at loan origination these properties typically require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply performance under existing leases could deteriorate and the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan clients and counterparties 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a counterparty or client disruption 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance at december 31 2021 represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of our existing loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to such as gdp unemployment corporate bond rates household income 30year mortgage rates and real estate values along with updated information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrict and caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable 

the most recent recession resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic does not appear to have had significant lasting impacts on collateral value however there are still risks to the current recovery that could reverse recent stable trends in asset prices 

these risks include 

• a correction in equity or housing markets 

• another surge in covid19 cases leading to a decrease in economic activity 

• further supply chain issues such as closed factories and disrupted port activity and 

• laborsupply constraints could continue longer than anticipated leading to slowing job growth and boosting wages along with inflation wageprice spiral 

the continued impact of the covid19 global pandemic could result in a deterioration of asset quality and an increase in credit losses  

the global pandemic shut down large portions of the us economy and has negatively impacted many of our customers as a result many businesses applied for payment deferrals and loan modifications as of december 31 2021 we have an immaterial amount of loans with an active covid19 deferral status as of december 31 2021 96 of covid19 deferrals that have expired are current net downgrades reached their peak in the third quarter of 2020 the portfolio has been in an upgrade cycle ever since with positive net upgrades throughout 2021 as a result we have decreased our loan loss reserve during 2021 in keeping with our established methodology the continued impact of the pandemic supply chain andor inflationary pressures could result in increasing loan loss reserves 

labor shortages and constraints in the supply chain could adversely affect our clients’ operations as well as our operations 

many sectors in the united states and around the world are experiencing a shortage of workers many of our commercial clients have been impacted by this shortage along with disruptions and constraints in the supply chain which could adversely impact their operationsthis could lead to reduced cash flow and difficulty in making loan repayments the financial services industry has also been affected by the shortage of workers which key has experienced with respect to certain roles entry level and technology roles specifically as well as increasing wages for entry level and certain professional roles this may lead to open positions remaining unfilled for longer periods of time or a need to increase wages to attract workers we have had to recently increase wages in certain positions to attract talent particularly in entrylevel type positions and certain specialty areas 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and tax legislation banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarly situated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly with respect to consumer bankingrelated 

table of contents 

practices including fair and responsible banking fair lending unfair deceptive or abusive practices and the community reinvestment act as well as compliance with aml bsa and office of foreign assets control efforts federal rulemaking bodies continue to pass new or modifications to significant regulations with upcoming effective dates there has also been an increase in state legislative activity particularly in areas such as student lending and privacy as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act are implemented in jurisdictions in which keybank operates the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject us to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes and regulations and taxes including industryspecific taxes and surcharges or their interpretation or implementation including any changes resulting from the recent change in us presidential administration could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways interpretation of consumer bankingrelated regulations may evolve as the industry and the regulators seek to increase access to banking products and services by consumers these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also impact consumer behavior limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

certain federal regulations have been in existence for decades without modification to account for modern banking practices such as digital delivery of products and services which can create challenges in execution and in the examination process emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies could limit keybank’s ability to track the movement of funds keybank’s ability to comply with bsaaml and other regulations is dependent on its ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive failure to comply with these and other regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto may result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business moreover different government administrations may have different regulatory priorities which may impact the level of regulation of financial institutions and the enforcement environment 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees or others outside of key clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats from cyber activity and computertelecommunications malfunctions fraudulent activity has escalated become more sophisticated and is ever evolving as there are more 

table of contents 

options to access financial services for instance in our form 8k filed july 16 2019 we disclosed that on or about july 9 2019 we discovered fraudulent activity associated with transactions conducted in the third quarter of 2019 by a business customer of keybank this fraudulent activity resulted in 139 million of net loan chargeoffs in 2019 operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs including remediation costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings expand our internal usage of webcloudbased products and applications and maintain and develop new relationships with third and fourth party providers in addition our ability to extend protections to customers’ information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems or that of a third party that provides services to us or our customers we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key have experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks credential stuffing and other means to the extent that we use third parties to provide services to our clients we seek to minimize the risk by performing due diligence and monitoring the third party but we cannot control all of the risks at these third parties should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to fully compensate us or otherwise protect us or our clients from the consequences 

in addition our customers routinely use keyissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions conducted with businesses in person and over the internet if the business’s systems that process or store debit or credit card information experience a security breach our card holders may experience fraud on their card accounts we may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions as well as for other costs such as replacing impacted cards key also provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data breach 

we also face risks related to the increasing interdependence and interconnectivity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other security breach that significantly compromises the systems of one or more financial parties or service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or market participants including us any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service clients or otherwise operate our business 

to date none of these efforts have had a material adverse effect on our business or operations or resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sourcesmalicious actors including but not limited to persons who constitute an insider threat who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems

to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering phishing and other methods our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that a malicious actor or our employees may intercept andor transmit or otherwise misuse unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm over the last few years several large companies have disclosed that they suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a significant impact on us 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expense in an effort to improve the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats nonetheless there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur if one does occur we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately while we do maintain cyber information security and business interruption insurance losses from a major interruption may exceed our coverage 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf additionally some of our third parties outsource aspects of their operations to other third parties commonly referred to as “fourth parties” these parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity and breakdowns or failures of their own systems internal processes and controls or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to identify or develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks additionally our internal audit function provides an independent assessment and 

table of contents 

testing of key’s internal controls policies and procedures any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed operated and tested is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met the systems may not work as intended or be circumvented by employees third parties or others outside of key additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively or fully mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by severe weather and natural disasters exacerbated by climate change 

natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and the timing and effects of any natural disaster cannot accurately be predicted the frequency and severity of some types of natural disasters including wildfires tornadoes and hurricanes have increased as a result of climate change which further reduces our ability to predict their effects accurately these and other natural disasters could affect key directly for example by interrupting our systems damaging our facilities or otherwise preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course or indirectly for example by damaging or destroying customer businesses or otherwise impairing customers’ ability to repay their loans or by damaging or destroying property pledged as collateral for loans made by key 

societal responses to climate change could adversely affect key’s business and performance including indirectly through impacts on key’s customers 

concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and may continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts new andor more stringent regulatory requirements could materially affect our results by requiring us to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming consumers and businesses also may change their own behavior as a result of these concerns key and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns key and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions operating process changes and the like the impact on key’s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities changes to regulations or market shifts to lowcarbon products could impact the credit worthiness or the value of assets securing loans of some of our customers which may require us to adjust our lending portfolios and business strategies key’s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions including by increasing business relationships with climatefriendly companies may not be effective in protecting key from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior 

the covid19 global pandemic has resulted in increased operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks much of our workforce has been working remotely and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities cybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business emails including an increase in phishing attempts and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time cybercriminals have also found new means of stealing identities and exploiting stolen identities during the pandemic this has resulted in increased fraud losses to us and the financial services industry the increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances in addition state and local orders and regulations regarding the conduct of inperson business operations including new or reimplemented measures imposed as a result of new covid19 variants some of which have been and may be in the future more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain and ongoing resurgences of covid19 cases across the us may impact our ability to operate at normal levels and to restore operations to their prepandemic level for an unknown period of time separately our thirdparty service providers have also been impacted by the pandemic and we have experienced some disruption to certain services performed by vendors to date these disruptions have not been material and we have developed solutions to work around these disruptions but we may experience additional disruption in the future which could adversely impact our business

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by banking regulations require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the liquidity standards require us to hold highquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

recently certain regulatory rule changes related to tailoring outlined in egrrcpa have been finalized while marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to key such as relief from lcr disclosure requirements overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future moreover key does not anticipate significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of the final rules 

federal agencies’ actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us 

the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve initiated a round of emergency interest rate cuts designed to mitigate some of the economic effects resulting from the pandemic in the future federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

table of contents 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank the ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

the covid19 global pandemic may continue to cause uncertainty in markets and may result in an increase in our cost of funds 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused a great amount of uncertainty in markets causing credit markets to seize and forcing companies including our clients to seek liquidity in the face of uncertain future cash flows to the extent that clients’ funds are not used as working capital and not placed on deposit with keybank we could be faced with funding significant draws of committed lending facilities along with requests for new facilities from our clients clients may look to key for additional funding vehicles should the capital markets become more unstable and illiquid as clients use deposit balances to fund their businesses this may put funding pressure on key which may cause us to leverage our secured funding sources or pay higher rates than normal for additional funding 

v market risk 

a worsening of the us economy and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions or downside shocks could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally recovering economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 

• a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors placing pressure on the price of key’s common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key 

• a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults 

• a decrease in household or corporate incomes reducing demand for key’s products and services 

table of contents 

• a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to key’s borrowers or a decrease in the quality of key’s loan portfolio increasing loan chargeoffs and reducing key’s net income 

• a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices 

• the extended continuation of the current lowinterest rate environment continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income 

• an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry 

• increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally and those of our transaction counterparties specifically 

• a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other issuers whose securities we hold and 

• an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the federal reserve raises interest rates and begins to reverse pandemicrelated stimulus programs the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of benchmark rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin 

moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

uncertainty surrounding the transition from libor to an alternate reference rate may adversely affect our business 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “authority” which regulates libor announced that the authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 on march 5 2021 ice benchmark administration “iba” the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor confirmed following a consultation process occurring during the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 its intention to cease oneweek and twomonth us libor settings at december 31 2021 and cease the us libor panel at june 30 2023 effectively ceasing all other us libor tenors a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is currently underway as regulators have issued guidance indicating that new libor originations should not extend beyond december 31 2021 although no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the united states the alternative reference rates of the federal reserve “arrc” and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate “sofr” as an alternative to us dollar libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities while sofr has been considered a likely alternative to libor and has been recommended by the arrc issues remain as to whether it will be the primary benchmark replacement or whether different credit sensitive benchmarks could also become marketaccepted accordingly whether sofr will become a marketaccepted alternative to libor remains uncertain at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of the authority’s and iba’s announcements or other regulatory changes or announcements the uncertainty surrounding regulatory guidance and market conventions impacting libor activity post december 31 2021 any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere the uncertainty regarding the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect keycorp’s financial condition and results of operations the adverse impact could take various forms and is dependent upon certain factors outside of our control such as timing of adoption by market forces of a new widely 

table of contents 

accepted libor replacement timing of libor cessation counterparty acceptance of a new reference rate for both new and existing contracts and competition presented by nonregulated entities among others additionally since libor and any replacement reference rate may have significantly different attributes it is difficult to predict the amount of increased costs associated with implementing the transition to a new reference rate including costs relative to product changes systems changes compliance and operational oversight costs and legal expenses among others 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and in certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint economic growth in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and the health of the overall us economy may differ from the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters impact of the covid19 pandemic or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare finance and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds insurance companies and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our loan or derivatives exposure 

less regulated and poorly capitalized nonbank financial institutions may be particularly vulnerable to asset quality deterioration as their borrower’s ability to service their obligations declines amid the pandemic this could put additional stress on traditional lenders 

table of contents 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highly skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals including financial and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors in addition negative information posted about key on social media websites whether or not factually correct may affect our reputation and our business prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

in addition social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms with public criticism for their relationships with clients engaged in industries they perceive to be harmful to communities or the environment such criticism directed at key could generate dissatisfaction among our stakeholders although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and other constituencies key as a large diversified financial services company with a high industry profile is inherently exposed to this risk furthermore investors have begun to consider how corporations are incorporating environmental social and governance esg matters including climate change into their business strategy these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of keycorp’s common stock if investors determine that keycorp has not made sufficient progress on esg matters 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce investing in digitalization to drive growth and simplification embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring expanding and retaining targeted client relationships the success of these initiatives can be subject to changes in the macroeconomic environment which is beyond our control in addition our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities or to do so in the expected timeframe may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks including large technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural customer preference and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and 

table of contents 

industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices equal to or lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop a talented and diverse workforce competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers additionally the profile of some of the people we target has changed significantly causing those with whom we compete for talent to also change and to include nonbanks and large technology companies we face additional competition particularly for employees who are able to work remotely as the impact of covid19 has increased remote opportunities which is likely to survive the pandemic in addition we may be constrained in hiring and retaining sufficient qualified employees due to general labor shortages in our industry including potential employee attrition resulting from any vaccine mandates that may be applicable to us to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

our incentive compensation structure and sales practices are subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including but not limited to estimating cecl measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the capital stress testing process models are simplified representations of realworld relationships thus our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and available data these assumptions provide only reasonable not absolute estimates particularly in times of market distress when historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant such as has been experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution models can also produce inadequate estimates due to errors in computer code use of unsuitable data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

we have an enterprisewide model risk management program designed to accurately identify measure report monitor and manage model risk the management of model risk includes independent validation and model governance establishing and monitoring model control standards and model risk metrics and completeness and accuracy of the inventory of models  

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

results of operations 

earnings overview 

the following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2021 dollars in millions 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

• the volume pricing mix and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities 

• the volume and value of net free funds such as noninterestbearing deposits and equity capital 

• the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 

• interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace 

• asset quality and 

• fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities 

to make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “te basis” ie as if all income were taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 126 an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 would yield 100 prior to 2018 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35 would yield 100 

table of contents 

te net interest income for 2021 was 41 billion and the net interest margin was 250 compared to te net interest income of 41 billion and a net interest margin of 277 for the prior year te net interest income benefited from lower deposit costs higher loan fees driven by ppp forgiveness and elevated levels of liquidity as we continued to experience higher levels of deposit inflows in 2021 te net interest income was also impacted by a lower net interest margin the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio and one less day in 2021 the decline in the net interest margin reflects a change in balance sheet mix including elevated levels of liquidity and lower reinvestment yields in 2022 we expect te net interest income to be relatively stable compared to 2021 and the net interest margin to be relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 

average loans totaled 1003 billion for 2021 compared to 1027 billion in 2020 commercial loans decreased 46 billion reflecting decreased utilization versus the prior year consumer loans increased 22 billion reflecting strength from keys consumer mortgage business and laurel road partially offset by the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio for 2022 we expect average loans to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2021 

average deposits totaled 1450 billion for 2021 an increase of 177 billion compared to 2020 the increase reflects growth from consumer and commercial relationships consumer retention of stimulus payments and higher commercial escrow deposits partially offset by declines in certificates of deposits and other time deposits for 2022 we expect average deposits to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2021 

figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of 4180 million for 2021 compared to 10 billion expense for 2020 the decrease in our provision for credit losses included a reserve release of 602 million and was largely driven by improvements in the economic outlook and asset quality as well as lower net chargeoffs in 2020 our provision for credit losses was impacted by the economic stress and uncertainty in the us and globally from the ongoing pandemic caused by covid19 as well as increased net loan chargeoffs in 2022 we expect net chargeoffs to average loans to be in the range of 20 to 30 bps

noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2021 was 32 billion compared to 27 billion during 2020 noninterest income represented 44 of total revenue for 2021 and 39 of total revenue for 2020 in 2022 we expect noninterest income to be down 1 to 3 compared to 2021 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2021 trust and investment services income increased 23 million or 45 as a result of an increase in assets under management 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2021 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under administration of 558 billion compared to 471 billion at december 31 2020 the increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the strength of the equity markets during the year 

figure 4 assets under administration 



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity underwriting fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2021 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 276 million or 418 from the prior year driven by growth in ma advisory fees and debt and equity underwriting fees 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts increased 26 million or 84 in 2021 compared to the prior year this increase stemmed from account analysis services and overdraft fees 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 47 million or 128 in 2021 compared to 2020 this increase was primarily due to increased transaction volume and spend on debit and credit card with a slight offset from reduced prepaid card activity as customers roll off government support programs 

other noninterest income 

other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income commercial mortgage servicing fees and other income other noninterest income increased 170 million or 211 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increases in commercial loan servicing fees and corporate services income stemming from other nonyield loan and commitment fees 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2021 was 44 billion compared to 41 billion for 2020 figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 in 2022 we expect noninterest expense to be down 1 to 3 compared to 2021

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 642 million for 2021 compared to 227 million for 2020 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 197 for 2021 and 146 for 2020 in 2022 we expect our gaap tax rate to be approximately 20 

in 2021 our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 “income taxes”

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

deposits and other sources of funds 

figure 20 breakdown of deposits at december 31 2021 

deposits are our primary source of funding at december 31 2021 our deposits totaled 1526 billion an increase of 173 billion compared to december 31 2020 the increase in deposits compared to the prior year was driven by growth from consumer and commercial relationships including higher commercial escrow deposits as well as growth from the retention of consumer stimulus payments and lower consumer spending 

wholesale funds consisting of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt totaled 128 billion at december 31 2021 compared to 147 billion at december 31 2020 strong deposit growth and elevated levels of liquidity resulted in less reliance on wholesale funds in 2021

capital 

the objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments we have identified three primary uses of capital 

1 investing in our businesses supporting our clients and loan growth 

2 maintaining or increasing our common share dividend and 

3 returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders 

the following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital for further information see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 24 “shareholders equity” 

a common share repurchases were suspended during the second quarter of 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic and resumed in the first quarter of 2021 

dividends 

consistent with our capital plans the board declared a quarterly dividend of 185 per common share for the first three quarters of 2021 and 195 for the fourth quarter of 2021 these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to 75 per common share for 2021 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 30734 holders of record at december 31 2021 our book value per common share was 1676 based on 9289 million shares outstanding at december 31 2021 compared to 1653 based on 9758 million shares outstanding at december 31 2020 at december 31 2021 our tangible book value per common share was 1372 compared to 1361 at december 31 2020

figure 22 changes in common shares outstanding 



during 2021 common shares outstanding decreased by 469 million shares primarily driven by the execution of an asr program but also due to common share repurchases under our 2020 and 2021 capital plans for additional information on the asr program including total repurchases under the program see note 24 “shareholders equity” 

at december 31 2021 we had 3279 million treasury shares compared to 2809 million treasury shares at december 31 2020 going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2021 our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 936 at december 31 2021 compared to 1056 at december 31 2020 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 695 at december 31 2021 compared to 793 at december 31 2020 the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31 2021 calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “basel iii” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report

offbalance sheet arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “principles of consolidation and basis of presentation” and in note 13 “variable interest entities”

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2021 is presented in note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 22 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are shown in the following chart and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” in this report

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at december 31 2021 we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm as the second line of defense is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account key’s covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at december 31 2021 covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

• fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds bonds backed by the us government agency and corporate bonds certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities securities issued by the us treasury money markets and certain cmos the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks 

• interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps caps and floors which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

table of contents 

we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the mrm back tests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of back testing are provided to the market risk committee back testing exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 10 million at december 31 2021 and 28 million at december 31 2020 figure 24 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

figure 24 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



stressed var is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the market risk committee and is calculated at the 99 confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general var the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 43 million at december 31 2021 and 28 million at december 31 2020 figure 25 summarizes our stressed var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020

internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was 18 million at december 31 2021 all of which were mortgagebacked security positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

• “reprice risk ” is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time 

• “basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes 

• “yield curve risk” is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve 

• “option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

libor transition 

as disclosed in item 1a risk factors of this report libor in its current form will generally not be available after 2021 for new contracts and the libor administrator will cease publishing all us libor tenors entirely after june 30 2023 for most products the most likely replacement rate is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc although uncertainty remains as to whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark the federal reserve and the occ have encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of 2021 to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we 

table of contents 

are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to 

• identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies 

• review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our liborbased business in response to evolving regulatory and market conditions 

• assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions 

• understand and strategically address the market approach to libor leading up to december 31 2021 and then post december 31 2021 relative to transition to alternative reference rates 

• determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for additional credit sensitive benchmarks and 

• remediate remaining libor contracts 

as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we are operationally ready for various sofrbased benchmarks including but not limited to daily simple sofr in arrears sofr compounded in arrears sofr averages in advance and term sofr we are actively quoting alternative indexes other than libor such as sofr and term sofr and have begun to originate new loans in those indexes we have also begun to originate a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates in a limited and managed fashion 

we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we have assessed the libor fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts our progress is wellpaced especially as many of the legacy contracts will be provided additional time to remediate due to announcements by the ice benchmark administration the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor that certain libor tenors may continue until june 2023 for legacy contract purposes in addition we completed our work to address contracts with libor tenors that had to transition by the end of 2021 we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments 

as of december 31 2021 key had the following loans derivative contracts and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor

net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero 

figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 at december 31 2021 our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest exposure to declining rates 

remains nominal given the low level of market rates in comparison to the floor utilized in the scenario exposure to 

rising rates has was relatively stable while exposure to declining rates increased due to higher market rates leaving room for term rates to fall tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect 

table of contents 

net interest income over the same period by more than 55 current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances 

figure 27 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 27 net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5 eg 40 to 45 then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 130 basis points 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment the interest rate shock scenarios are equal to the current fed target rate capped at 200 basis points in the current low rate environment the declining shock scenario is reduced with a 100 basis point minimum this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2021 

table of contents 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 28 shows all derivative positions that we hold for alm purposes the swap positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities”

c excludes accrued interest of 108 million and 145 million at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively 

liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

table of contents 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2021 are shown in figure 29 we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 29 credit ratings 



a p1 rating assigned by moody’s is specific to keybank’s shortterm bank deposit ratings f1 assigned by fitch ratings inc is specific to keybank’s shortterm deposit ratings 

managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our business model which involves taking in deposits many of which can be withdrawn at anytime and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strateg y the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2021 totaled 462 billion consisting of 359 billion of unpledged securities 21 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 102 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk changes in market value or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2021 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 239 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 128 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2021 key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances decreased by 33 million due to a decrease in borrowings

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2021 our loantodeposit ratio was 689 which we calculate as the sum of total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 20 “longterm debt” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on june 16 2021 keybank issued 800 million fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due june 14 2024 and 400 million floating rate senior bank notes due june 14 2024 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2021 keycorp held 23 billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2021 keybank paid 19 billion in cash dividends to keycorp at january 1 2022 keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 844 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of the elevated level of deposits the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower

allowance for loan and lease losses 

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly the alll estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience current borrower characteristics current conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 financial instruments — credit losses and as such an expected credit loss methodology specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll for more information see note 5 “asset quality” 

as shown in figure 30 our alll from continuing operations decreased by 565 million or 347 from december 31 2020 the commercial alll decreased by 411 million or 374 from december 31 2020 driven by improvements in the economic outlook as pressures from the global covid19 pandemic eased and asset quality improved the consumer alll decreased 154 million or 292 from december 31 2020 driven by an improved economic outlook partially offset by growth in the portfolio

operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards this includes our compliance with lending programs established by the cares act including the ppp and main street lending program under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorp’s erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems shut down access to systems for ransom or cause other damage as the threat landscape continues to evolve critical infrastructure including financial services remains a top target for cyberattacks covid19 has created a unique situation globally with many more employees and thirdparty service providers working from home which inherently introduces additional risk cyberattacks may include but are not limited to attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions attempts to breach the security of systems and data and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of their customers recently there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or to restore company access to locked systems we may incur expenses related to the 

table of contents 

investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients to date key has not experienced material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers as a result of the heightened threat landscape of cyberattacks see the risk factor entitled “our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security” in part 1 item 1a risk factors for additional information on risks related to information security 

as described in more detail in “risk management — overview” in item 7 of this report the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board’s risk committee has primary oversight for enterprisewide risk at keycorp including operational risk which includes cybersecurity the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk board members are updated on cybersecurity matters at each regularlyscheduled board meeting the erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk including cyberrelated risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not 

audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under gaap 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 



a for the years ended december 31 2021 december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 intangible assets exclude 3 million 4 million and 7 million respectively of periodend purchased credit card relationships

c for the years ended december 31 2021 december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 average intangible assets exclude 4 million 6 million and 10 million respectively of average purchased credit card relationships 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly 

comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

table of contents 

amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change and include among others 

• pd 

• lgd 

• outstanding balance of the loan 

• movement through delinquency stages 

• amounts and timing of expected future cash flows 

• value of collateral which may be obtained from third parties 

• economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider and 

• qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in modeled results 

as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note 1 “basis of presentation and accounting policies” of this report under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our alll which has three main components i asset specific  individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves 

we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed these models use observed loanlevel 

table of contents 

information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all 

term loans we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes such as loan to value 

if we observe limitations in the data or models we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts 

this estimate produced by our models is forwardlooking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument moody’s consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions as the length of the life of a financial asset increases these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning available industry guidance and reliability of various forecasting services following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios 

a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we use a 20 year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables we determined the 20 year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles as well as the impact from the pandemic 

the alll is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as gdp and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico ltv and delinquency status our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance 

it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall alll because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the alll changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast we compared the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario the maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate 8 decline in gdp annualized growth and an approximate 5 increase in the us unemployment rate the difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately 18x for commercial and 15x for the consumer modeled allowance results 

similarly deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions stressing risk ratings by two grades for commercial loans generates a 16x increase in the commercial modeled allowance results stressing fico by ten points and ltv and utilization by 10 for consumer loans generates a 12x increase in the consumer modeled allowance results 

note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions however they are not intended to estimate changes in the overall alll as they do not reflect qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses

valuation methodologies 

fair value measurements 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level 1 valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level 2 valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level 3 valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not 

be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets an 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed 

see note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes 

goodwill 

table of contents 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 

under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units consumer bank commercial bank and institutional bank we perform our annual impairment test as of october 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed testing may be either quantitative or qualitative fair value is measured during quantitative tests using a combination of income and market approaches if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit when utilizing the qualitative testing approach key examines numerous qualitative factors such as financial performance market capitalization and other industry and economic trends to conclude whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 

we monitor impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note 12 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

table of contents 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives and hedging” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee contingent aspects of guarantees within the scope of asc 326 are assessed a reserve under cecl there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2021 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and all available positive and negative evidence we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 14 “income taxes”

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2020 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier 1 capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period “regulatory capital rules” as of april 1 2020 the regulatory capital rules are fully phasedin for key consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust 

preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2020 keycorp’s ratios under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules are set forth in the following table 

minimum capital ratios and keycorp ratios under 

regulatory capital rules 



a as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the 3 supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january 1 2018 

b stress capital buffer must consist of common equity tier 1 capital as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 25 imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the regulatory capital rules 

c ratios reflect the fiveyear transition of cecl impacts on regulatory ratios 

revised prompt corrective action framework 

the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prompt corrective action framework 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action framework 



a a “well capitalized” institution also must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 

b as a standardized approach banking organization keybank is not subject to the 3 supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january 1 2018 

we believe that as of december 31 2020 keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

recent regulatory capitalrelated developments 

in december 2017 the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets “rwas” and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by 1 enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk 2 constraining the use of internal models 

by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk 3 introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and 4 replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach 

the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committee’s efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements 

subsequently in december 2018 the basel committee released an update to its pillar 3 disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committee’s final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar 3 disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december 2017 

on july 9 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations including key the final rule simplifies for these banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25 deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250 risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital the final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital in addition the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the regulatory capital rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule provided an effective date of october 1 2019 for the technical amendments and an effective date of april 1 2020 for the simplification changes on november 13 2019 the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either january 1 2020 or april 1 2020 we chose to implement the simplification changes on april 1 2020 

in november 2019 the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the regulatory capital rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate “hvcre” exposure hvcre exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the regulatory capital rules the final rule which became effective on april 1 2020 conforms the hvcre definition to statutory changes enacted in may 2018 the final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised hvcre definition of credit facilities that finance onetofour family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land 

a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in february 2019 provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on march 27 2020 the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under us accounting standards to adopt cecl before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years cecl’s adverse effects on regulatory capital “cecl interim final rule” this is in addition to the threeyear transition period already in place resulting in an optional fiveyear transition the agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the us economy caused by covid19 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” enacted on march 27 2020 provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with cecl until the earlier of i the termination date of the national emergency concerning covid19 declared by the president under the national emergencies act or ii december 31 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a statement on march 31 2020 indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of 

regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule after the end of the statutory relief period alternatively banking organizations may adopt cecl as planned in 2020 and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule starting at the time of their adoption of cecl 

on august 26 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the cecl interim final rule like the cecl interim final rule the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period which results in an optional fiveyear transition the final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional fiveyear transition to include any institution adopting cecl in 2020 the final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount key elected to adopt cecl as planned in the first quarter of 2020 and exercise the option to use a fiveyear transition to measure cecl’s effects on regulatory capital 

liquidity requirements 

us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october 1 2018 

large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively “epss” including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa enacted on may 24 2018 raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from 50 billion to 250 billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhc’s or bhcs’ capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors 

in october 2019 the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa “tailoring rules” the final rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories “category iv firms” the tailoring rules became effective on december 31 2019 

in one of the tailoring rules the federal banking agencies amended various rules including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this final rule category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than 50 billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp believes that it does not meet the 50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced lcr thus as of december 31 2019 keycorp is no longer subject to an lcr requirement or an lcr public disclosure requirement 

in the other tailoring rule the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards including liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firm’s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr 2052a liquidity reporting requirements 

on october 20 2020 the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the basel iii nsfr for us banking organizations the nsfr final rule which is effective on july 1 2021 requires certain banking organizations with more than 100 billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets commitments and derivatives exposures over a oneyear time horizon the final nsfr rule tailors the application of the nsfr requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions established by the tailoring rules key is a category iv firm category iv firms with average weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than 50 billion will not be subject to an nsfr requirement key believes that it does not meet the 50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an nsfr requirement 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 100 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with the bhc’s ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon 

the federal reserve’s ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

the federal reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and 

severely adverse scenarios and through 2018 an adverse scenario that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests have been disclosed under the “regulatory disclosures  filings” section of the “financials” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

one of the tailoring rules issued by the federal reserve in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa changes the stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs that are category iv firms like keycorp under this rule category iv firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case in 2020 keycorp was required to participate in the federal reserve’s ccar process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve 

a separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in october 2019 to implement a provision in egrrcpa that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federallyregulated banks to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from 10 billion to 250 billion in total consolidated assets under this final rule federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than 250 billion like keybank will no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the “adverse” scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only “baseline” and “severely adverse” scenarios 

on march 4 2020 the federal reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the federal reserve’s regulatory capital rules with ccar and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to bhcs that have 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp under the final rule the federal reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which will be based on the results of an individual bhc’s supervisory stress test and cannot be less than 25 percent of riskweighted assets a firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on october 1 of each year and will remain in effect until september 30 of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve 

on march 20 2020 the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies’ regulatory capital rules the revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the federal reserve on march 4 2020 the revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress including the period of stress resulting from the covid19 pandemic on august 26 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts without change the interim final rule issued in march 2020 that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies’ regulatory capital rules 

in april 2020 we submitted our 2020 capital plan to the federal reserve under the federal reserve’s ccar process on june 25 2020 the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its ccar process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of 33 bhcs having more than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms which would take effect in the fourth quarter of 2020 the federal reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the covid19 disruptions 

because of the results of its sensitivity analysis the federal reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and reevaluate their capital plans specifically the federal reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the 

appropriate reserve bank within 45 days after the federal reserve provides updated scenarios the federal reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of 2020 these firms were prohibited from i making share repurchases other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans and ii paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the federal reserve the federal reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarterbyquarter depending upon the economic circumstances 

on june 30 2020 keycorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement provided by the federal reserve as part of the 2020 federal reserve capital stress testing exercise is 25 which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of key keycorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at the same level as the second quarter of 2020 subject to approval by keycorp’s board of directors which the board subsequently approved on july 8 2020 on august 10 2020 the federal reserve confirmed keycorp’s stress capital requirement of 25 

on september 17 2020 the federal reserve announced three supervisory scenarios baseline severely adverse and alternative severe that firms subject to the federal reserve’s capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated 2020 capital plan resubmissions and that the federal reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms the federal reserve stated that it planned to release firmspecific results from the firms’ performance under these scenarios by the end of 2020 

due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic the federal reserve announced on september 30 2020 that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience specifically the federal reserve stated that banking organizations with more than 100 billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2020 that they were subject to for the third quarter of 2020 

on december 18 2020 the federal reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for 2020 that it conducted on large banking organizations including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that in the aggregate capital ratios for the 33 firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios however the federal reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of 2021 with certain modifications the federal reserve said that these firms including keycorp 1 are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and 2 are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters the federal reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of 2021 and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until march 31 2021 

on january 19 2021 the federal reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including keycorp to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the federal reserve adopted in an october 2019 rulemaking the final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that category iv firms are required to submit to the federal reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements also the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms in addition the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the 

payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the federal reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic for more information on these restrictions please see the section above entitled “regulatory capital requirements  capital planning and stress testing” and for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the bank’s ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 on july 16 2019 the fdic approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule among other things the amendments to this rule i provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than april 1 2021 upon notification to the fdic ii clarify the certification requirement iii revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a passthrough basis where the bank’s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds and iv streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the fdic 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public sections of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank are available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

in october 2019 the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have 75 billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements 

on april 16 2019 the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas i creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size complexity and other factors ii revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions iii improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the fdic and institutions on resolutionrelated matters and iv revision of the 50 billion asset threshold in the current rule the fdic indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements under each of these approaches institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan the fdic would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions comments on this anpr were due by june 21 2019 any changes to this rule will impact keybank the fdic extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed 

on january 19 2021 the fdic issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with 100 billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans the fdic said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues the fdic further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm 

other regulatory developments 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note 6 “fair value measurements” in item 8 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 as of december 31 2020 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology 

on october 8 2019 five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the final rule i revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the volcker rule ii modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions iii adds additional proprietary trading exclusions and iv tailors the rule’s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm’s trading assets and liabilities under the final rule a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has “significant” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least 20 billion a banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between 1 billion and 20 billion is regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity’s activities size scope and complexity a presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with “limited” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than 1 billion the final rule rule became effective on january 1 2020 and the compliance date was january 1 2021 key believes that it will be regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule we do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on key 

on june 25 2020 five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fundrelated provisions of the volcker rule among other things the final rule i permits certain lowrisk transactions including intraday credit riskless principal and payment clearing and settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations small business investment companies and public welfare investment funds and iii permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address such as credit funds venture capital funds customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles the final rule became effective on october 1 2020 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2019 in 2011 the federal reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa which was enacted on may 24 2018 raised from 50 billion to 250 billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp also this statute requires the federal reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of bhcs with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least 50 billion 

on june 14 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

in one of the tailoring rules issued in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp believes that it is a category iv firm the least restrictive of these categories the tailoring rules are discussed further under the headings “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” and “regulatory capital requirements  capital planning and stress testing” 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

supervision and governance 

on november 2 2018 the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more like keycorp “lfi rating system” in order to align the federal reserve’s rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions 

and will assess an institution’s capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned initial ratings under the lfi rating system in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and assigned initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp 

the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system is the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors published by the federal reserve on august 3 2017 identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution’s governance and controls the proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the federal reserve most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization’s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors in addition the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in federal reserve supervision and regulation letters that could be eliminated or revised the federal reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until february 15 2018 

on january 4 2018 the federal reserve released the final proposal related to the lfi rating system  the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm’s board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march 15 2018 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act “cra” was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome “lmi” neighborhoods consistent with the institutions’ safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods 

on may 20 2020 the occ issued a final rule to revise the agency’s cra regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the occ assesses a bank’s cra performance the occ stated that it was doing so in order to make the cra regulatory framework more objective transparent consistent in application and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities particularly lmi neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved the final rule i clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for cra credit ii updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for cra purposes iii creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating cra performance and iv provides for more timely and transparent crarelated data collection recordkeeping and reporting the occ indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds benchmarks and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating the final rule became effective on october 1 2020 large national banks like keybank are required to comply with the rule by january 1 2023 

on september 21 2020 the federal reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public comment on ways to modernize cra regulations by strengthening clarifying and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the cra the anpr seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of lmi communities and address inequities in credit 

access when it issued the anpr the federal reserve said that it hoped the anpr would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to cra regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders comments are due by february 16 2021 if the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their cra regulations keybank will be required to comply with the revised regulations 

on november 24 2020 the occ requested public comment on an npr setting forth the occ’s proposed approach for determining the benchmarks thresholds and minimums that would be used in assessing a bank’s performance under the general performance standards contained in the occ’s 2020 final cra rule the proposal also explains how the occ would assess a significant decline in a bank’s cra activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks thresholds and minimums further the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the 2020 final cra rule comments on the npr are due by february 2 2021 on december 15 2020 the occ published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the occ would require banks subject to the cra general performance standards to complete the occ said that it intends to use the bankspecific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks thresholds and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the cra rule comments on this notice are due by february 16 2021 

control standards 

on january 30 2020 the federal reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new comprehensive framework for determining control under the bhca and the home owners’ loan act the final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the federal reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company the final rule codifies existing federal reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents the final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company’s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors including board representation officer and employee interlocks and the existence of business relationships between the companies by providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations the final rule may facilitate i bhcs making minority investments in nonbank companies and ii nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations the final rule became effective september 30 2020 

regulatory developments concerning covid19 

federal state and local governments have adopted various statutes rules regulations orders and guidelines in order to address the covid19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals families businesses and governments financial institutions including key are affected by many of these measures including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where key does business financial services firms like other businesses are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees 

during the covid19 crisis the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers’ needs certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings “regulatory capital requirements — recent regulatory capitalrelated developments” and “regulatory capital requirements — capital planning and stress testing” in addition the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on march 22 2020 addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the covid19 crisis the agencies stated that shortterm loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as tdrs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to covid19 as past due because of the deferral 

the cares act enacted on march 27 2020 contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations the cares act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to guarantee loans to or make investments in businesses banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs and when they do so they will be subject to certain requirements one of these programs is the ppp a program administered by the small business administration the “sba” to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the covid19 crisis the loans can be made by sbacertified lenders and are 100 guaranteed by the sba the loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied in which event the sba will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts keybank has participated in the ppp as a lender 

the cares act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations among other changes the cares act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend gaap principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to covid19 that would otherwise be categorized as tdrs from march 1 2020 through the earlier of december 31 2020 or 60 days after the covid19 national emergency ends in addition the cares act requires mortgage servicers to grant on a borrower’s request forbearance for up to 180 days which can be extended for an additional 180 days on a federallybacked singlefamily mortgage loan or forbearance for up to 30 days which can be extended for two additional 30day periods on a federallybacked multifamily mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the covid19 emergency 

on april 3 2020 federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking lossmitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide shortterm forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the covid19 emergency including forbearance provided in accordance with the cares act provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time 

on april 7 2020 the federal banking agencies in consultation with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between i their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to covid19 need to be treated as tdrs and ii the cares act provision on this subject in this interagency statement the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the covid19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action 

the federal reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households businesses and governments one of these facilities is the paycheck protection program liquidity facility “ppplf” which was set up to allow the federal reserve banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate ppp loans taking the loans as collateral at face value on april 9 2020 the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of ppp loans financed under the ppplf on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations on september 29 2020 the federal banking agencies announced their adoption of this interim final rule as a final rule in addition on june 22 2020 the fdic issued a final rule that mitigates the impact of ppp lending on banks’ deposit insurance assessments also in accordance with the cares act a ppp loan will be assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies’ riskbased capital rules 

on june 23 2020 the federal banking agencies in conjunction with state bank regulators issued interagency examiner guidance outlining supervisory principles for assessing the safety and soundness of banks given the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic the agencies stated that they will consider the unique evolving and potentially longterm nature of the issues that banks are confronting and will exercise appropriate flexibility in their supervisory response the agencies said that they will continue to assess institutions in accordance with existing agency policies and procedures and will consider whether a bank’s management has managed risk appropriately including taking appropriate actions in response to stresses caused by the covid19 pandemic 

the consolidated appropriations act 2021 “caa” enacted on december 27 2020 contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations among other things the caa extends the provision in the cares act that allows financial institutions to suspend gaap principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to covid19 that would otherwise be categorized as tdrs through the earlier of january 1 2022 or 60 days after the covid19 national emergency ends the caa also provides additional funding for sbaguaranteed loans to small businesses under the ppp discussed above and makes a number of changes to this program including the expansion of the pool of eligible borrowers and the addition of certain categories of expenses that will be eligible for forgiveness keybank participates in the ppp as a lender 




 item 1a risk factors 

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 71 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than single family residential real estate loans and other types of consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of loans in this category could cause an increase in nonperforming loans which could result in lower earnings from these loans additional provision for loan and lease losses and ultimately an increase in loan losses 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity while the covid19 pandemic has impacted the commercial real estate market property values have remained relatively stable development and construction continue but at muted levels and deliveries of additional units into the market have been supported oversupply is a concern in certain urban and gateway markets however our exposures in those markets are limited the most severely impacted commercial real estate segments have been in hospitality and retail however monthly collections have improved key’s office and retail exposures are 6 of our total commercial real estate exposure substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could negatively impact our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate but in the higher performing multifamily space a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans or to refinance the loans at maturity a relatively small portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans new construction and valueadd or rehabilitation construction projects are not fully leased at loan origination these properties typically require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply performance under existing leases could deteriorate and the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a counterparty or client disruption 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance at december 31 2020 represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of our existing loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to such as gdp unemployment corporate bond rates household income 30 year mortgage rates and real estate values along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrict and caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable the current recession has not had significant impacts on collateral value continued recessionary pressures could reverse recent stable trends in asset prices 

the covid19 global pandemic could result in a deterioration of asset quality and an increase in credit losses  

the global pandemic has shut down large portions of the us economy and has negatively impacted many of our customers as a result many businesses have or will have lower revenues and many consumers will have lower income this negative impact on customers’ cash flow could result in their inability to repay loans which could have a negative impact on our asset quality although the rating degradation to date has stabilized many customers have requested and have been granted hardship relief in the form of payment deferrals and modifications as well as loans through the cares act if customers are unable to repay their loans in a timely manner following hardship relief it could result in further deterioration of asset quality an increase in delinquency some reversal of accrued interest income and some increase in loan losses as a result we increased our loan loss reserve in the first second and third quarters of 2020 the continued impact of the pandemic could result in a further increase to our loan loss reserve 

oil prices have declined significantly which could lead to increased credit losses in our oil and gas loan portfolio  

the oil market faced a dropoff in demand due to the impact of the covid19 global pandemic on much of the global economy the decline in demand coupled with insufficient storage capacity for oil caused oil prices to decline significantly as a result some oil companies began to halt production and associated exploration in 2020 while oil prices have recovered from their low point in 2020 the oil and gas sector continues to suffer from low oil prices and as a result companies in that sector will have lower revenues and cash flows some oil companies have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection as well our oil and gas loan portfolio represented only 28 of our total commercial loan portfolio at december 31 2020 and our exposure is primarily reservebased with approximately half tied to natural gas which has shown better price performance however even with our limited exposure the negative impact of low oil prices could result in increased credit losses 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and tax legislation banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarly situated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly with respect to consumer bankingrelated practices as well as compliance with aml bsa and office of foreign assets control efforts federal rulemaking bodies continue to pass new or modifications to significant regulations with upcoming effective dates there has also been an increase in state legislative activity particularly in areas such as student lending and privacy as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act are implemented in jurisdictions in which keybank operates the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject us to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes and regulations and taxes including industryspecific taxes and surcharges or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also impact consumer behavior limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

certain federal regulations have been in existence for decades without modification to account for modern banking practices such as digital delivery of products and services which can create challenges in execution and in the examination process emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies could limit keybank’s ability to track the movement of funds keybank’s ability to comply with bsaaml and other regulations is dependent on its ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive failure to comply with these and other regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto may result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees or others outside of key clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats from cyber activity and computertelecommunications malfunctions fraudulent activity has escalated become more sophisticated and is ever evolving as there are more options to access financial services for instance in our form 8k filed july 16 2019 we disclosed that on or about july 9 2019 we discovered fraudulent activity associated with transactions conducted in the third quarter of 2019 by a business customer of keybank this fraudulent activity resulted in 139 million of net loan chargeoffs in 2019 operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs including remediation costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings expand our internal usage of webcloudbased products and applications and maintain and develop new relationships with third and fourth party providers in addition our ability to extend protections to customers’ information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems or that of a third party that provides services to us or our customers we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks credential stuffing and other means in 2020 many companies and us government organizations were victims of a sophisticated and targeted supply chain attack on the solarwinds orion software while key does not utilize the solarwinds software products some of our vendors do to the extent that we use third parties to provide services to our clients we seek to minimize the risk by performing due diligence and monitoring the third party but we cannot control all of the risks at these third parties should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to fully compensate us or otherwise protect us or our clients from the consequences 

in addition our customers routinely use keyissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions conducted with businesses in person and over the internet if the business’s systems that process or store debit or credit card information experience a security breach our card holders may experience fraud on their card accounts we may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions as well as for other costs such as replacing impacted cards key also provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data breach 

we also face risks related to the increasing interdependence and interconnectivity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other security breach that significantly compromises the systems of one or more financial parties or service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or market participants including us any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service clients or otherwise operate our business 

to date none of these efforts have had a material adverse effect on our business or operations or resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sourcesmalicious actors including but not limited to persons who constitute an insider threat who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering phishing and other methods our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that a malicious actor or our employees may intercept andor transmit or otherwise misuse unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm over the last few years several large companies have disclosed that they suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a significant impact on us 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expense in an effort to improve the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats nonetheless there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur if one does occur we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately while we do maintain information security risk insurance losses from a major interruption may exceed our coverage 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf additionally some of our third parties outsource aspects of their operations to other third parties commonly referred to as “fourth parties” these parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity and breakdowns or failures of their own systems internal processes and controls or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to identify or develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting 

compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks additionally our internal audit function provides an independent assessment and testing of key’s internal controls policies and procedures any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed operated and tested is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met the systems may not work as intended or be circumvented by employees third parties or others outside of key additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively or fully mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather global pandemics natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism global pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing our loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

additionally potential future shutdowns of portions of the federal government could negatively impact the financial performance of certain customers and could negatively impact customers’ future access to certain loan and guaranty programs 

the covid19 global pandemic has resulted in increased operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks much of our workforce has been working remotely and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities cybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business emails including an increase in phishing attempts and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time cybercriminals have also found new means of stealing identities and exploiting stolen identities during the pandemic this has resulted in increased fraud losses to us and the financial services industry the increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances in addition state and local orders and regulations regarding the conduct of inperson business operations may impact our ability to operate at normal levels and to restore operations to their prepandemic level for an unknown period of time separately our thirdparty service providers have also been impacted by the pandemic and we have experienced some disruption to certain services performed by vendors to date these disruptions have not been material and we have developed solutions to work around these disruptions but we may experience additional disruption in the future which could adversely impact our business 

our participation in the paycheck protection program may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation and could result in damage to our reputation 

we provided over 43000 loans with over 8 billion in funding and were the seventh overall lender in the ppp in 2020 the ppp and many lenders that participated in the ppp have been the subject of much publicity and regular media stories there have been lawsuits by borrowers and purported agents against lenders related to the program and we have been the subject of litigation related to the ppp although such litigation has not been material to date our participation in the program could result in increased exposure to litigation in the future in addition our practices and procedures related to the ppp could be scrutinized by government or regulatory agencies 

government or regulatory scrutiny or increased litigation could result in financial liability or damage to our reputation this could also result in increased legal and compliance costs 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by banking regulations require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the liquidity standards require us to hold highquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

recently certain regulatory rule changes related to tailoring outlined in egrrcpa have been finalized while marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to key such as relief from lcr compliance overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future moreover key does not anticipate significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of the final rules finally additional guidance and rulemaking related to capital planning and stress testing have yet to be finalized and impacts resulting from these potential changes remain unknown 

federal agencies’ actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us 

the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve initiated a round of emergency interest rate cuts designed to mitigate some of the economic effects resulting from the pandemic in the future federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank the ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

the covid19 global pandemic may continue to cause uncertainty in markets and may result in an increase in our cost of funds 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused a great amount of uncertainty in markets causing credit markets to seize and forcing companies including our clients to seek liquidity in the face of uncertain future cash flows to the extent that clients’ funds are not used as working capital and not placed on deposit with keybank we could be faced with funding significant draws of committed lending facilities along with requests for new facilities from our clients clients may look to key for additional funding vehicles should the capital markets become more unstable and illiquid as clients use deposit balances to fund their businesses this may put funding pressure on key which may cause us to leverage our secured funding sources or pay higher rates than normal for additional funding 

v market risk 

a worsening of the us economy and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions or downside shocks could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally recovering economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 

• a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors placing pressure on the price of key’s common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key 

• a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults 

• a decrease in household or corporate incomes reducing demand for key’s products and services 

• a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to key’s borrowers or a decrease in the quality of key’s loan portfolio increasing loan chargeoffs and reducing key’s net income 

• a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices 

• the extended continuation of the current lowinterest rate environment continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income 

• an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry 

• increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally and those of our transaction counterparties specifically 

• a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other governments whose securities we hold and 

• an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the federal reserve raises interest rates and begins to reverse pandemicrelated stimulus programs the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin 

moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

uncertainty surrounding the transition from libor to an alternate reference rate may adversely affect our business 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “authority” which regulates libor announced that the authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 subsequently on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration iba the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor announced that it would start a consultation process in december 2020 which was open for feedback through the end of january 2021 on its intention to cease us libor iba intends that subject to confirmation following its consultation oneweek and twomonth us libor settings will cease at december 31 2021 and that the us libor panel will cease at june 30 2023 effectively ceasing all other us libor tenors a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is expected to occur before the end of 2021 as regulators have issued guidance indicating that new libor originations should not extend beyond december 31 2021 although no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the united states the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate “sofr” as an alternative to us dollar libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities while sofr has been considered a likely alternative to libor issues remain as to its implementation and given the iba’s announcement noted above it is uncertain whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark accordingly whether sofr will become a marketaccepted alternative to libor remains uncertain at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of the authority’s announcement iba’s consultation or other regulatory changes or announcements any 

establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere the uncertainty regarding the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect keycorp’s financial condition and results of operations the adverse impact could take various forms and is dependent upon certain factors outside of our control such as timing of adoption by market forces of a new widely accepted libor replacement timing of libor cessation and counterparty acceptance of a new reference rate for both new and existing contracts among others additionally since libor and any replacement reference rate may have significantly different attributes it is difficult to predict the amount of increased costs associated with implementing the transition to a new reference rate including costs relative to product changes systems changes compliance and operational oversight costs and legal expenses among others 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and in certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint economic growth in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and the health of the overall us economy may differ from the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds insurance companies and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our loan or derivatives exposure 

less regulated and poorly capitalized nonbank financial institutions may be particularly vulnerable to asset quality deterioration as their borrower’s ability to service their obligations declines amid the pandemic this could put additional stress on traditional lenders 

the impact of the covid19 global pandemic has resulted in economic disruption related to interest rate risk and market risk 

on march 15 2020 the federal reserve lowered the fed funds target rate range to 0 to 25 basis points down from 175 basis points at december 31 2019 other shortterm rates such as libor have declined as well due to liquidity stress in money markets because key is positioned as modestly asset sensitive declining interest rates will negatively impact our net interest income assuming all loan and deposit volumes are held constant 

additionally as it pertains to our trading activities described in more detail in the “market risk management” section within management’s discussion and analysis in a decreasing interest rate environment our credit valuation adjustment cva to derivative exposure generally increases due to the nature of our derivatives business model the increase in derivatives exposure combined with the credit spread widening that drives the market implied probability of default increases our credit reserves this increase in credit reserves had a negative impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2020 the adverse impact of the covid19 global pandemic also caused market disruption in certain asset classes within our fixed income business the temporary decrease in market liquidity along with the decrease in interest rates and spread widening had a negative impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2020 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highly skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the great recession we faced increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals including financial and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors in addition negative information posted about key on social media websites whether or not factually correct may affect our reputation and our business prospects actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce investing in digitalization to drive growth and simplification embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring expanding and retaining targeted client relationships the success of these initiatives can be subject to changes in the macroeconomic environment which is beyond our control in addition our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities or to do so in the expected timeframe may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks including large technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural customer preference and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on 

quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices equal to or lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop a talented and diverse workforce competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers additionally the profile of some of the people we target has changed significantly causing those with whom we compete for talent to also change and to include nonbanks and large technology companies to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

our incentive compensation structure and sales practices are subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including but not limited to estimating current expected credit losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the capital stress testing process because models are representations of reality our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and available data these assumptions provide only reasonable not absolute estimates particularly in times of market distress when historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution models can also produce inadequate estimates due to errors in computer code use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

we have an enterprisewide model risk management program designed to accurately identify measure report monitor and manage model risk the management of model risk includes independent validation and model governance establishing and monitoring model control standards and model risk metrics and completeness and accuracy of the inventory of models  

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

• fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities 

to make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “te basis” ie as if all 

income were taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 126 an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 would yield 100 prior to 2018 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35 would yield 100 

figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

te net interest income for 2020 was 41 billion and the net interest margin was 277 compared to te net interest income of 39 billion and a net interest margin of 304 for the prior year net interest income for 2020 reflects an increase in earning asset balances and higher loan fees partially offset by a lower net interest margin the net interest margin was impacted by lower interest rates key’s participation in the ppp and elevated levels of liquidity in 2021 we expect te net interest income to be relatively stable compared to 2020 and the net interest margin to be relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 

average loans totaled 1027 billion for 2020 compared to 915 billion in 2019 commercial loans increased 77 billion reflecting key’s participation in the ppp as well as core broad based growth in commercial and industrial loans consumer loans increased 35 billion driven by strength from laurel road and keys consumer mortgage business for 2021 we expect average loans to be relatively stable compared to 2020 

average deposits totaled 1273 billion for 2020 an increase of 173 billion compared to 2019 reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships partially offset by a decline in time deposits as a result of lower interest rates for 2021 we expect average deposits to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2020

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 10 billion for 2020 compared to 445 million for 2019 the increase of 576 million in our provision for credit losses is primarily due to the economic stress and uncertainty in the us and globally from the ongoing pandemic caused by covid19 as well as increased net loan chargeoffs in 2019 our provision for credit losses was impacted by the realization of 139 million from a previously disclosed fraud loss in 2021 we expect loan chargeoffs to average loans to be in the range of 50 to 60 bps 

noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2020 was 27 billion compared to 25 billion during 2019 noninterest income represented 39 of total revenue for 2020 and 38 of total revenue for 2019 in 2021 we expect noninterest income to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2020 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 3 noninterest income 

a other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income mortgage servicing fees and other income see the consolidated statements of income in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2020 trust and investment services income increased 32 million or 67 as a result of an increase in assets under management 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2020 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 441 billion compared to 408 billion at december 31 2019 the increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to the strength of the equity markets during the year 

figure 4 assets under management 



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2020 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 31 million or 49 from the prior year driven by gains on the sale of commercial mortgages and strong debt and equity financing fees 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts decreased 26 million or 77 in 2020 compared to the prior year these decreases were primarily due to lower customer spending and higher fee waivers related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 93 million or 338 in 2020 compared to 2019 this increase was primarily due to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs 

other noninterest income 

other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income mortgage servicing fees and other income other noninterest income increased 63 million or 85 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven primarily by record mortgage origination income partially offset by trading losses and portfolio marks related to the widening credit spreads in the market 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2020 was 41 billion compared to 39 billion for 2019 figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 in 2021 we expect noninterest expense to be down 1 to 3 compared to 2020 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 5 noninterest expense 

a other noninterest expense includes equipment operating lease expense marketing fdic assessment intangible asset amortization oreo expense net and other expense see the consolidated statements of income in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

personnel 

as shown in figure 6 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 86 million or 38 in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase is driven by higher productionrelated incentives from our record fee production and higher salaries due to merit increases 

figure 6 personnel expense 



a excludes directors’ stockbased compensation of 2 million in 2020 and 3 million in 2019 reported as “other noninterest expense” in figure 5 

net occupancy 

net occupancy expense increased 5 million or 17 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher property reserve expenses and cleaning expenses related to the steps that we have taken to ensure the health and safety of teammates and customers during the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

other noninterest expense 

other noninterest expense includes equipment operating lease expense marketing fdic assessment intangible asset amortization oreo expenses and other miscellaneous expense categories in total other noninterest expense increased 89 million or 93 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily attributable to higher paymentsrelated expenses from prepaid card activity 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 227 million for 2020 compared to 314 million for 2019 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 146 for 2020 and 156 for 2019 in 2021 we expect our gaap tax rate to be approximately 19 

in 2020 our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 “income taxes” 

business segments results 

we previously reported our results of operations through two business segments key community bank and key corporate bank with the remaining operations recorded in other in the first quarter of 2019 we underwent a companywide organizational change resulting in the realignment of our businesses into two reportable business segments consumer bank and commercial bank with the remaining operations that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business recorded in other the new business segment structure aligns with how management reviews performance and makes decisions by client segment and business unit prior period information was restated to conform to the new business segment structure

covid19 hardship relief programs 

in response to the covid19 pandemic beginning in march 2020 we began providing relief and flexibility to our customers through a variety of solutions including fee waivers shortterm loan modifications and payment deferrals as well as the suspension of vehicle repossessions and home foreclosures while the solutions for our commercial borrowers are individually negotiated and tailored to each borrower’s specific facts and circumstances the most commonly offered relief measures included temporary covenant waivers andor deferrals of principal andor interest payments for up to 90 days we have also granted shortterm loan modifications for our consumer loan customers through extensions deferrals and forbearance 

the following table provides a summary of portfolio loans and leases as of december 31 2020 that have received a payment deferral or forbearance as part of our covid19 hardship relief programs 

figure 8 loans and leases covid19 hardship relief 



the total outstanding balance of commercial loans in active relief as of december 31 2020 represented 03 of our commercial loan portfolio and the total outstanding balance of consumer loans in active relief as of december 31 2020 represented 13 of the consumer portfolio as of december 31 2020 the cumulative number of commercial loans that have received any form of hardship relief due to covid19 hardships totaled 251 loans and the cumulative number of consumer loans that have received any form of hardship relief due to covid19 hardships totaled 4766 loans 

under the cares act as well as banking regulator interagency guidance certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of the economic impacts created by covid19 may not be required to be treated as tdrs under us gaap for covid19 related loan modifications which occurred from march 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and met the loan modification criteria under either the cares act or the criteria specified by the regulatory agencies or were otherwise considered to be short term in nature we have elected to suspend tdr accounting for such loan modifications additionally loans qualifying for these modifications are not required to be reported as delinquent nonaccrual impaired or criticized solely as a result of a covid19 loan modification refer to note 5 “asset quality” under the headings “tdrs” and “nonperforming and past due loans” 

for loans that receive a payment deferral or forbearance under these hardship relief programs we continue to accrue interest and recognize interest income during the period of the deferral depending on the terms of each program all or a portion of this accrued interest may be paid directly by the borrower either during the relief period at the end of the relief period or at maturity of the loan or added to the customer’s outstanding balance for certain programs the maturity date of the loan may also be extended by the number of payments deferred interest income will continue to be accrued at the original contractual interest rate unless that rate is concurrently modified upon entering the relief program in which case the modified rate would be used to recognize interest 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 720 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 39 billion or 58 compared to december 31 2019 driven by the outstanding balance of 67 billion related to the ppp partly offset by a decline in commercial and industrial utilization rates 

as a result of the current economic environment our commercial loan portfolio is going through active portfolio surveillance we are conducting ongoing portfolio reviews on our commercial loans with any risk rating migrations being closely monitored we have centralized internal reporting on enterprisewide relief initiatives as well as following any potential relief initiatives that may come in the future we have also established a pandemic watchlist and are performing ongoing reviews of commercial clients that are likely to be impacted by covid19 overall these clients represent a small portion of the overall portfolio and are diversified by type and geogr aphy figure 9 summarizes our commercial portfolios that are at risk of being impacted by the covid19 pandemic as of december 31 2020

commercial and industrial loans totaled 529 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 46 billion compared to december 31 2019 the growth was broadbased and spread across most industry categories as the impact of covid19 resulted in an outstanding balance of 67 billion related to the ppp partially offset by a decline in commercial line utilization rates 

commercial real estate loans  our commercial real estate lending business includes both mortgage and construction loans and is conducted through two primary sources our 15state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties represented 80 of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2020 construction loans which provide a stream of 

funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project represented 14 of commercial real estate loans at year end  

at december 31 2020 commercial real estate loans totaled 147 billion comprised of 127 billion of mortgage loans and 20 billion of construction loans compared to december 31 2019 this portfolio decreased 375 million driven by declines in retail properties and office buildings the impact of ecommerce accelerated by the pandemic resulted in retailers downsizing to smaller more efficient spaces with collaborative workspace and open offices losing appeal remote working and the need for flexibility in space and leasing is driving the move away from central business district cbd markets to lower density regions

figure 17 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 



a includes securities held in the availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios 

securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

capital 

the objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments we have identified three primary uses of capital 

1 investing in our businesses supporting our clients and loan growth 

2 maintaining or increasing our common share dividend and 

3 returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders 

the following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital for further information see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 24 “shareholders equity” 

a common share repurchases were suspended during the third quarter of 2015 due to the then pending merger with first niagara we resumed our common share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016 upon the completion of the first niagara merger common share repurchases were suspended during the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic 

dividends 

consistent with our capital plans the board declared a quarterly dividend of 185 per common share for each quarter of 2020 these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to 74 per common share for 2020 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 32099 holders of record at december 31 2020 our book value per common share was 1653 based on 9758 million shares outstanding at december 31 2020 compared to 1554 based on 9772 million shares outstanding at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 our tangible book value per common share was 1361 compared to 1256 at december 31 2019

figure 22 shows activities that caused the change in our outstanding common shares over the past two years 

figure 22 changes in common shares outstanding 



during 2020 common shares outstanding decreased by 14 million shares due to common share repurchases under our 2019 and 2020 capital plans 

at december 31 2020 we had 2809 million treasury shares compared to 2795 million treasury shares at december 31 2019 going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2020 our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1056 at december 31 2020 compared to 1175 at december 31 2019 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 793 at december 31 2020 compared to 864 at december 31 2019 the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31 2020 calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “basel iii” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

figure 23 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 under the regulatory capital rules information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of keycorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented in note 24 “shareholders equity”

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “principles of consolidation and basis of presentation” and in note 13 “variable interest entities” 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2020 is presented in note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 24 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 22 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 24 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2020 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 24 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 



a deposits and borrowings exclude interest 

b includes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees 

guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are shown in the following chart and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations the table below depicts our risk management hierarchy and associated responsibilities and activities of each group 



– the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” in this report 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at december 31 2020 we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm as the second line of defense is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account key’s covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at december 31 2020 covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

• fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds bonds backed by the us government agency and corporate bonds certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities securities issued by the us treasury money markets and certain cmos the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks 

• interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps caps and floors which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 28 million at december 31 2020 and 9 million at december 31 2019 figure 25 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

figure 25 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



stressed var is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the market risk committee and is calculated at the 99 confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general var the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 28 million at december 31 2020 and 51 million at december 31 2019 figure 26 summarizes our stressed var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

figure 26 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions we had no securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule at december 31 2020 specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

• “reprice risk ” is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time 

• “basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes 

• “yield curve risk” is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve 

• “option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

libor transition 

as disclosed in item 1a risk factors of this report libor in its current form is not expected to be available after 2021 for new contracts and to cease publishing all tenors entirely after june 30 2023 for most products the most likely replacement rate is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc although uncertainty remains as to whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark the federal reserve and the occ have encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of 2021 to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we are collaborating closely with regulators and 

industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to 

• identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies 

• review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our current liborbased business currently being written 

• assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions 

• understand and strategically address the current market approach to libor and sofr and 

• determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for sofr or additional credit sensitive benchmarks 

as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we are progressing on schedule to be operationally ready for sofr we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we are assessing the libor fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts we have also focused on refining libor fallback language in new legal contracts including requiring the use of robust fallback language our progress is wellpaced especially as it is likely many of the legacy contracts will be provided additional time to remediate due to recent announcements by the ice benchmark administration the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor that certain libor tenors may continue until june 2023 for legacy contract purposes we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments 

net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero 

figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest exposure to declining rates 

remains nominal given the low level of market rates in comparison to the floor utilized in the scenario exposure to 

rising rates has changed from a detriment in 2019 to a benefit currently as the lower actual market rates reduce the 

need for additional modeled hedges and lower the projected deposit pricing beta to rising rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 55 current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances 

figure 27 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including 

steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 27 net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5 eg 40 to 45 then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 120 basis points 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2020 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 28 shows all derivative positions that we hold for alm purposes the swap positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities”

c excludes accrued interest of 145 million and 543 million at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively 

liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2020 are shown in figure 29  we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 29 credit ratings 



a p1 rating assigned by moody’s is specific to keybank’s shortterm bank deposit ratings 

managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our business model which involves taking in deposits many of which can be withdrawn at anytime and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2020 totaled 366 billion consisting of 211 billion of unpledged securities 669 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 154 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2020 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 226 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 84 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2020 key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances increased by 05 billion due to an increase in borrowings 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2020 our loantodeposit ratio was 765 which we calculate as the sum of total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 20 “longterm debt” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on march 10 2020 keybank issued 700 million of 125 senior bank notes due march 10 2023 on december 16 2020 keybank issued 750 million of fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due january 3 2024 and 350 million of floating rate senior bank notes due january 3 2024 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2020 keycorp held 38 billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2020 keybank paid 125 billion in cash dividends to keycorp at january 1 2021 keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 720 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

on february 6 2020 keycorp issued 800 million of 2250 senior notes due april 6 2027 under its mediumterm note program 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in balances held at the federal reserve partially offset by a decrease in unpledged securities the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market 

for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly the alll estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience current borrower characteristics current conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors as described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 financial instruments — credit losses and as such an expected credit loss methodology specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll for more information see note 5 “asset quality” 

as shown in figure 30 our alll from continuing operations increased by 726 million or 807 from december 31 2019 our commercial alll decreased by 124 million or 165 with the adoption of asu 201613 financial instruments — credit losses at january 1 2020 the commercial alll increased by 472 million or 753 from january 1 2020 through december 31 2020 driven by updated economic forecasts that capture additional deterioration triggered by the global covid19 pandemic our consumer alll increased by 328 million or 2201 with the adoption of asu 201613 financial instruments — credit losses at january 1 2020 the consumer alll increased 50 million or 105 from january 1 2020 through december 31 2020 driven by portfolio growth and updated economic forecasts that capture additional deterioration triggered by the global covid19 pandemic

operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee supports the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments the operational risk committee includes attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks in 2020 many companies and us government organizations were victims of a sophisticated and targeted supply chain attack on the solarwinds orion software while key does not utilize the solarwinds software products some of our vendors do we may incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these 

threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients see the risk factor entitled “our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security” in part 1 item 1a risk factors for additional information on risks related to information security 

as described in more detail in “risk management — overview” in item 7 of this report the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board’s risk committee has primary oversight for enterprisewide risk at keycorp including operational risk which includes cybersecurity the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk board members are updated on cybersecurity matters at each regularlyscheduled board meeting the erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk including cyberrelated risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not 

audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under gaap 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 



a for the years ended december 31 2020 december 31 2019 december 31 2018 december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 intangible assets exclude 4 million 7 million 14 million 26 million and 42 million respectively of periodend purchased credit card relationships 

b net of capital surplus 

c for the years ended december 31 2020 december 31 2019 december 31 2018 december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 average intangible assets exclude 6 million 10 million 20 million 34 million and 43 million respectively of average purchased credit card relationships 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly 

comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 



fourth quarter results 

figure 35 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2020 are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 549 million or 56 per diluted common share compared to 439 million or 45 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2019 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 135 compared to 127 for the fourth quarter of 2019 the annualized return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations was 1661 for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 1409 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

te net interest income was 10 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to te net interest income of 987 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 the increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances and loan fees partially offset by a lower net interest margin the net interest margin was impacted by lower interest rates and a change in balance sheet mix including elevated levels of liquidity and keys participation in the ppp 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 802 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 651 million for the yearago quarter noninterest income increased by 151 million primarily driven by a 62 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees the record fourth quarter of 2020 for investment banking and debt placement fees was largely related to strong ma activity cards and payments income increased 30 million from the yearago period driven by higher prepaid card activity additionally investments made in keys mortgage business continue to drive consumer mortgage income and commercial mortgage servicing fees which increased 22 million and 13 million respectively from the yearago quarter 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 11 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 980 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 the increase is primarily related to higher personnel costs of 110 million reflecting higher productionrelated incentives and higher salaries due to merit increases other drivers for the yearoveryear increases include paymentsrelated expenses from prepaid card activity incurred in the current period as well as covid19related costs related to steps that the company has taken to ensure the health and safety of teammates 

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 20 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 109 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 the provision for credit losses reflects the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on january 1 2020 this framework requires that management estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life and consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions our alll was 16 billion or 161 of total periodend loans at december 31 2020 compared to 95 at december 31 2019 

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled 135 million or 53 of average total loans these results compare to 99 million or 42 for the fourth quarter of 2019 the allowance for credit losses was 18 billion or 180 of total periodend loans at december 31 2020 compared to 102 at december 31 2019 

at december 31 2020 key’s nonperforming loans totaled 785 million which represented 78 of periodend portfolio loans these results compare to 61 at december 31 2019 nonperforming assets at december 31 2020 totaled 937 million and represented 92 of periodend portfolio loans and oreo and other nonperforming assets compared to 75 at december 31 2019 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2020 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 114 million compared to a tax provision of 75 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 the fourth quarter of 2019 included a tax benefit o f 11 million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance against federal and state capital loss carryforwards acquired from first niagara financial group utilized in the quarter the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 165 compared to 140 for the same quarter one year ago 

our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 “income taxes”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 

in conjunction with the adoption of asc 326 on january 1 2020 the critical accounting policy and estimate disclosure for our alll was updated the accounting policy for goodwill was also updated due to the adoption of asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change and include among others 

• pd 

• lgd 

• outstanding balance of the loan 

• movement through delinquency stages 

• amounts and timing of expected future cash flows 

• value of collateral which may be obtained from third parties 

• economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider and 

• qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in modeled 

results 

as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note 1 “basis of presentation and accounting policies” of this report under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our alll which has three main components i asset specific  individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves 

we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed these models use observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all 

term loans we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes such as loan to value 

if we observe limitations in the data or models we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts 

this estimate produced by our models is forwardlooking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument moody’s consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions as the length of the life of a financial asset increases these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning available industry guidance and reliability of various forecasting services following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios 

a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we use a 20 year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables we determined the 20 year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles including the last downturn and our more recent positive credit experience 

the alll is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as gdp and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico ltv and delinquency status our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance 

it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall alll because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the alll changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast we compared the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario the maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate 8 decline in gdp annualized growth and an approximate 4 increase in the us unemployment rate the difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately 19x for commercial and 14x for the consumer modeled allowance results 

similarly deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions stressing risk ratings by two grades for commercial loans generates a 13x increase in the commercial modeled allowance results stressing fico by ten points and ltv and utilization by 10 for consumer loans generates a 12x increase in the consumer modeled allowance results 

note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions however they are not intended to estimate changes in the overall alll as they do not reflect qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses with the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic future alll results may vary considerably based on the actual magnitude of the pandemic and impact of the united states monetary and fiscal response 

valuation methodologies 

fair value measurements 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level 1 valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level 2 valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level 3 valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not 

be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets an 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed 

see note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes 

goodwill 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 

under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units consumer bank commercial bank and institutional bank we perform our annual impairment test as of october 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed effective january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” eliminating the second step of goodwill impairment testing under the new guidance if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the adoption of asu 201704 did not impact our current financial condition or results of operations 

in consideration of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions due to the 

covid19 pandemic during the third quarter of 2020 we identified a triggering event and performed an interim quantitative test impairment indicators comprised economic conditions including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery industry and market considerations government intervention and regulatory updates the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units performance of our stock and other relevant events we utilized a qualitative approach to our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 2020 no impairment was recorded in 2020 as a result of these assessments 

we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note 12 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives and hedging” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee contingent aspects of guarantees within the scope of asc 326 are assessed a reserve under cecl there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 22 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2020 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and all available positive and negative evidence we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 14 “income taxes”

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2019  we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier 1 capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period ending on december 31 2018 “regulatory capital rules” consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for 

purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2019  key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 937 under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules also at december 31 2019 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk would be as set forth in the following table 

pro forma ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 



 

revised prompt corrective action framework 

the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prompt corrective action framework 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action framework 



 we believe that as of december 31 2019  keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

recent regulatory capitalrelated developments 

in december 2017 the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets “rwas” and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by 1 enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk 2 constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk 3 introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and 

4 replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach 

the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committee’s efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements 

subsequently in december 2018 the basel committee released an update to its pillar 3 disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committee’s final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar 3 disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december 2017 

in december 2018 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to amend their regulatory capital rules to address the regulatory capital effects of forthcoming changes to gaap set forth in the issuance by the fasb of asu no 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit loses on financial instruments which introduces the current expected credit loss methodology to replace the incurred loss methodology for financial assets the final rule identifies which credit loss allowances under the new accounting standard are eligible for inclusion in a banking organization’s regulatory capital and provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of adoption of the new accounting standard on retained earnings deferred tax assets credit loss allowances and average total consolidated assets for sec filers excluding smaller reporting companies such as keycorp the new accounting standard will become effective for the first fiscal year starting after december 15 2019 keycorp has elected to evenly phase in the capital impact from the adoption of cecl from 2020 to 2023 

on july 9 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations including key the final rule simplifies for these banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single 25 deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a 250 risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital the final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital in addition the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the regulatory capital rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule provided an effective date of october 1 2019 for the technical amendments and an effective date of april 1 2020 for the simplification changes on november 13 2019 the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either january 1 2020 or april 1 2020 we have chosen to implement the simplification changes on april 1 2020 

in november 2019 the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the regulatory capital rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate “hvcre” exposure hvcre exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the regulatory capital rules the final rule conforms the hvcre definition to statutory changes enacted in may 2018 the final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised hvcre definition of credit facilities that finance onetofour family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land the effective date of the final rule is april 1 2020 

liquidity requirements 

us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 at december 31 2019  keycorp’s modified lcr was above 100 in the future keycorp may change the composition of its investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october 1 2018 

the federal banking agencies commenced implementation of the basel iii nsfr in the united states in april and may 2016 with the release of a proposed rule to implement a minimum net stable funding ratio “nsfr” requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations excluding keycorp and a modified version of the minimum nsfr requirement “modified nsfr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp together with quarterly public disclosure requirements the comment period for the npr expired on august 5 2016 the federal banking agencies have not yet issued a final rule to implement the nsfr in the united states 

large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively “epss” including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa enacted on may 24 2018 raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from 50 billion to 250 billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhc’s or bhcs’ capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors 

in october 2019 the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa “tailoring rules” the final rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories “category iv firms” the tailoring rules became effective on december 31 2019 

in one of the tailoring rules the federal banking agencies amended various rules including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this final rule category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than 50 billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp believes that it does not meet the 50 billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced lcr thus as of december 31 2019 keycorp is no longer subject to an lcr requirement or an lcr public disclosure requirement 

in the other tailoring rule the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards including liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firm’s internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr 2052a liquidity reporting requirements 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 100 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large noncomplex bhc as set forth in a federal reserve guidance document issued on december 18 2015 “sr letter 1519” under sr letter 1519 the federal reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding governance risk management internal controls capital policy capital positions incorporating stressful conditions and events and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules sr letter 1519 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm’s capital planning processes 

the federal reserve’s ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

the federal reserve conducts a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios and through 2018 an adverse scenario that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact 

of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests have been disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosures  filings” section of the “financials” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

on february 5 2019 the federal reserve announced that for 2019 certain lesscomplex bhcs with total consolidated assets between 100 billion and 250 billion including keycorp were not subject to supervisory stress testing or companyrun stress testing and were not required to participate in ccar or submit a capital plan to the federal reserve however the federal reserve indicated that each of these firms including keycorp remains subject to the requirement to develop and maintain a capital plan which will have to be reviewed and approved by the firm’s board of directors or committee thereof at least annually keybank like keycorp did not have to conduct a companyrun stress test in 2019 since the occ informed occregulated institutions with total consolidated assets from 100 billion to less than 250 billion that they will not be required to comply with any stress testing requirements in 2019 

one of the tailoring rules issued by the federal reserve in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa changes the stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs that are category iv firms like keycorp under this rule category iv firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case in 2020 keycorp will be required to participate in the federal reserve’s ccar process and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve 

a separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in october 2019 to implement a provision in egrrcpa that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federallyregulated banks to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from 10 billion to 250 billion in total consolidated assets under this final rule federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than 250 billion like keybank will no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the “adverse” scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only “baseline” and “severely adverse” scenarios 

in a release published on april 10 2018 the federal reserve invited comment on a proposal to integrate certain aspects of the federal reserve’s regulatory capital rules with the ccar and stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to banking organizations subject to the capital plan rule including keycorp under the proposal the federal reserve would i amend the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which would be based on the results of an individual banking organization’s supervisory stress test ii introduce a stress leverage buffer requirement that would replace the existing tier 1 leverage requirement under ccar iii modify certain assumptions under the supervisory stress test iv remove the 30 dividend payout ratio limitation as a criterion for heightened supervisory scrutiny of an organization’s capital plan and v eliminate the ccar quantitative objection 

under the proposed rule a banking organization would not be subject to any limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it satisfies all minimum capital requirements and its capital conservation requirement as amended to incorporate the stress capital buffer stress leverage buffer requirement and if applicable the advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and supplementary leverage ratio standard the latter two of which do not apply to keycorp the comment period for this proposal ended on june 25 2018 key expects that the proposal would have a marginally favorable impact on its capital requirements 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the 

earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “ restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities ” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the bank’s ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 on july 16 2019 the fdic approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule among other things the amendments to this rule i provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than april 1 2021 upon notification to the fdic ii clarify the certification requirement iii revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a passthrough basis where the bank’s account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds and iv streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the fdic 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public section of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

in october 2019 the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have 75 billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp will no longer be subject to resolution planning requirements 

on april 16 2019 the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas i creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size complexity and other factors ii revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions iii improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the fdic and institutions on resolutionrelated matters and iv revision of the 50 billion asset threshold in the current rule the fdic indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements under each of these approaches institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan the fdic would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions comments on this anpr were due by june 21 2019 any changes to this rule will impact keybank the fdic extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed 

other regulatory developments 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie 

contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note 6 “ fair value measurements ” in item 8 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 as of december 31 2019 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology 

on october 8 2019 five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the final rule i revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the volcker rule ii modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions iii adds additional proprietary trading exclusions and iv tailors the rule’s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm’s trading assets and liabilities under the final rule a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has “significant” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least 20 billion a banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between 1 billion and 20 billion is regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entity’s activities size scope and complexity a presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with “limited” trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than 1 billion the effective date of the final rule is january 1 2020 and the compliance date is january 1 2021 key believes that it will be regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule we do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on key 

on january 30 2020 five federal agencies invited public comment on a proposal that is intended to clarify and streamline the covered fundrelated provisions of the volcker rule among other things the proposal would i permit certain lowrisk transactions including intraday credit and payment clearing and settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarify exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations and small business investment companies and iii permit banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address such as credit funds venture capital funds customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles comments on this proposal are due by april 1 2020 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

as enacted in 2010 the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2019 in 2011 the federal reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they 

relate to liquidity risk management and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

egrrcpa  which was enacted on may 24 2018 raised from 50 billion to 250 billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp also this statute requires the federal reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of bhcs with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least 50 billion 

on june 14 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

in one of the tailoring rules issued in october 2019 to implement egrrcpa the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules based on key’s analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp believes that it is a category iv firm the least restrictive of these categories the tailoring rules are discussed further under the headings “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” and “regulatory capital requirements  capital planning and stress testing” 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

supervision and governance 

on november 2 2018 the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more like keycorp “lfi rating system” in order to align the federal reserve’s rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institution’s capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned initial ratings under the lfi 

rating system in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and intends to assign initial ratings in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp 

the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system is the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors published by the federal reserve on august 3 2017 identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution’s governance and controls the proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the federal reserve most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization’s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors in addition the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in federal reserve supervision and regulation letters that could be eliminated or revised the federal reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until february 15 2018 

on january 4 2018 the federal reserve released the final proposal related to the lfi rating system  the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm’s board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march 15 2018 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act “cra” was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome “lmi” neighborhoods consistent with the institutions’ safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods 

on december 12 2019 the occ and the fdic requested public comment on a proposal to revise the agencies’ cra regulations to modernize the framework by which the occ and the fdic assess a bank’s cra performance the agencies stated that they were doing so in order to make the regulatory framework more objective transparent consistent and easy to understand and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve their communities the proposal would i clarify and expand which activities qualify for cra credit ii update the definition of the areas where activities count for cra credit iii create a more transparent and objective method for measuring cra performance and iv provide for more transparent consistent and timely crarelated data collection recordkeeping and reporting the proposal was published in the federal register on january 9 2020 comments are due by april 8 2020 any revision of the occ’s cra regulations would apply to national banks including keybank 

  

control standards 

on january 30 2020 the federal reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new comprehensive framework for determining control under the bhca and the home owners’ loan act the final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the federal reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company the final rule codifies existing federal reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents the final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing company’s voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors including board representation officer and employee interlocks and the existence of business relationships between the companies by providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control 

determinations the final rule may facilitate i bhcs making minority investments in nonbank companies and ii nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations 




 item 1a risk factors 

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 72 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover the debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance at december 31 2019 reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends all of which may undergo material changes 

as described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 financial instrumentscredit losses and as such in determining the alll under cecl we must estimate expected lifetime credit losses based on information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to such as gdp unemployment corporate bond rates household income 30 year mortgage rates and real estate values along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrict and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and tax legislation banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarlysituated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly with respect to consumer bankingrelated practices as well as compliance with aml bsa and office of foreign assets control efforts federal rulemaking bodies continue to pass new or modifications to significant regulations with upcoming effective dates there has also been an increase in state legislative activity particularly in areas such as student lending and privacy as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act are implemented in jurisdictions in which keybank operates the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject us to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes and regulations and taxes including industryspecific taxes and surcharges or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also 

impact consumer behavior limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

certain federal regulations have been in existence for decades without modification to account for modern banking practices such as digital delivery of products and services which can create challenges in execution and in the examination process emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies could limit keybank’s ability to track the movement of funds keybank’s ability to comply with bsaaml and other regulations is dependent on its ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive failure to comply with these and other regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto may result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats from cyber activity and computertelecommunications malfunctions fraudulent activity has escalated become more sophisticated and is ever evolving as there are more options to access financial services for instance in our form 8k filed july 16 2019 we disclosed that on or about july 9 2019 we discovered fraudulent activity associated with transactions conducted in the third quarter of 2019 by a business customer of keybank this fraudulent activity resulted in 139 million of net loan chargeoffs in 2019 operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs including remediation costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may 

increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings expand our internal usage of webcloudbased products and applications and maintain and develop new relationships with third and fourth party providers in addition our ability to extend protections to customers’ information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems or that of a third party that provides services to us or our customers we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks credential stuffing and other means to the extent that we use third parties to provide services to our clients we seek to minimize the risk by performing due diligence and monitoring the third party but we cannot control all of the risks at these third parties should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to fully compensate us or otherwise protect us or our clients from the consequences 

in addition our customers routinely use keyissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions conducted with businesses in person and over the internet if the business’s systems that process or store debit or credit card information experience a security breach our card holders may experience fraud on their card accounts we may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions as well as for other costs such as replacing impacted cards key also provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data breach 

we also face risks related to the increasing interdependence and interconnectivity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other security breach that significantly compromises the systems of one or more financial parties or service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or market participants including us any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service clients or otherwise operate our business 

to date none of these efforts have had a material adverse effect on our business or operations or resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sourcesmalicious actors including but not limited to persons who constitute an insider threat who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering phishing and other methods our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that a malicious actor or our employees may intercept andor transmit or otherwise misuse unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm over the last few years several large companies have disclosed that they suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a significant impact on us 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expense in an effort to improve the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats nonetheless there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur if one does occur we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf additionally some of our third parties outsource aspects of their operations to other third parties commonly referred to as “fourth parties” these parties are subject 

to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity and breakdowns or failures of their own systems internal processes and controls or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to identify or develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks additionally our internal audit function provides an independent assessment and testing of key’s internal controls policies and procedures any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed operated and tested is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met the systems may not work as intended or be circumvented by employees third parties or others outside of key additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively or fully mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather global pandemics natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism global pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of 

collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

additionally potential future shutdowns of portions of the federal government could negatively impact the financial performance of certain customers and could negatively impact customers’ future access to certain loan and guaranty programs 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the liquidity standards require us to hold highquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

recently certain regulatory rule changes related to tailoring outlined in egrrcpa have been finalized while marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to key such as relief from lcr compliance overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future moreover key does not anticipate significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of the final rules finally additional guidance and rulemaking related to capital planning and stress testing have yet to be finalized and impacts resulting from these potential changes remain unknown 

federal agencies’ actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve initiated a round of interest rate cuts designed to maintain economic expansion in the future federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends 

by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank the ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 



 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the federal reserve raises interest rates and begins to reverse quantitative easing the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin 

moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

uncertainty surrounding the transition from libor to an alternate reference rate may adversely affect our business 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “authority” which regulates libor announced that the authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is expected to occur before the end of 2021 although no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the united states the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate “sofr” as an alternative to us dollar libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities while sofr is currently considered a likely alternative to libor issues remain as to its implementation accordingly whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor remains uncertain at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of the authority’s announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere the uncertainty regarding the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect keycorp’s financial condition and results of operations the adverse impact could take various forms and is dependent upon certain factors outside of our control such as timing of adoption by market forces of a new widely accepted libor replacement timing of libor cessation and counterparty acceptance of a new reference rate for both new and existing contracts among others additionally since libor and any replacement reference rate may have significantly different attributes it is difficult to predict the amount of increased costs associated with implementing the transition to a new reference rate including costs relative to product changes systems chang es compliance and operational oversight costs and legal expenses among others 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint economic growth in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and the health of the overall us economy may differ from the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals including financial and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring expanding and retaining targeted client relationships our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks including large technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers additionally the profile of some of the people we target has changed significantly causing those with whom we compete for talent to also change and to include nonbanks and large technology companies to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these 

employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

our incentive compensation structure and sales practices are subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating incurred loan and lease losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk such as setting reserves and for capital planning purposes including during the capital stress testing process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and being compatible to the available data these assumptions have certain limitations and may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not fully capture or express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capital when we may not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

results of operations 

earnings overview 

the following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2018  to the year ended december 31 2019 dollars in millions 



net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

to make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “te basis” ie as if all income were taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 126 an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 would yield 100 prior to 2018 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35 would yield 100 

figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

te net interest income for 2019 was 39 billion  and the net interest margin was 304  compared to te net interest income of 39 billion and a net interest margin of 317 for the prior year net interest income for 2019 reflects an increase in earning asset balances partially offset by a decline in loan fees and a lower net interest margin additionally purchase accounting accretion declined 38 million the net interest margin was impacted by a lag in deposit pricing as interest rates moved lower during the second half of 2019 in 2020  we expect te net interest income to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2019 and the net interest margin to be relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 

 

average loans totaled 915 billion for 2019  compared to 883 billion in 2018  commercial loans increased 2  1 billion reflecting broadbased growth in commercial and industrial loans partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage and construction loans consumer loans increased 1  1 billion driven by solid growth from laurel road residential mortgage loans and indirect auto lending  for 2020  we expect average loans to be up 4 to 6 compared to 2019 

average deposits totaled 1100 billion for 2019  an increase of 50 billion compared to 2018  reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships  for 2020  we expect average deposits to be up 1 to 3 compared to 2019

figure 2 shows how the changes in yields or rates and average balances from the prior year affected net interest income the section entitled “financial condition” contains additional discussion about changes in earning assets and funding sources 

figure 2 components of net interest income changes from continuing operations 





provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 445 million for 2019  compared to 246 million for 2018  the increase of 199 million in our provision for credit losses is primarily due to the realization of 139 million from a previously disclosed fraud loss in 2020 given a relatively stable economic outlook we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan chargeoffs to provide for loan growth 

noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2019 was 25 billion  compared to 25 billion during 2018  noninterest income represented 38 of total revenue for 2019 and 39 of total revenue for 2018  in 2020  we expect noninterest income to be up 4 to 6 compared to 2019  

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 3 noninterest income 

 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2019  trust and investment services income decrease d 24 million  or 48  from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in insurance commissions as a result of the sale of kibs in the second quarter of 2018 which contributed 22 million of income for 2018 prior to the sale 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2019  our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 408 billion  compared to 368 billion at december 31 2018  the increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the market appreciation during the year as the market recovered from a decline that occurred during the second half of 2018 

figure 4 assets under management 



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2019  investment banking and debt placement fees decrease d 20 million  or 31  from the prior year due to the market disruption from the government shutdown that occurred early in 2019 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts decrease d 12 million  or 34  in 2019 compared to the prior year 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increase d 5 million  or 19  in 2019 compared to 2018  this increase was primarily due to higher debit card credit card and merchant fees 

other noninterest income 

other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income mortgage servicing fees and other income other noninterest income decreased 5 million  or 7  in 2019 compared to 2018  other income was down primarily due to a 78 million gain related to the sale of kibs during the second quarter of 2018 partially offsetting this was an increase in operating lease income and other leasing gains which was negatively impacted by a 42 million lease residual loss in the second quarter of 2018 as well as higher consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees reflecting our ongoing investment in our residential mortgage business 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2019 was 39 billion  compared to 40 billion for 2018  figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2019  in 2020  we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable compared to 2019  

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 5 noninterest expense 

 

personnel 

as shown in figure 6  personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense decrease d by 59 million  or 26  in 2019 compared to 2018  the decrease reflected the successful implementation of our expense initiatives which resulted in a 83 million decrease in salary and contract labor expense 

figure 6 personnel expense 



 

net occupancy 

net occupancy expense decrease d 15 million  or 49  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to lower depreciation and rental expenses 

other noninterest expense 

other noninterest expense includes equipment operating lease expense marketing fdic assessment intangible asset amortization oreo expenses and other miscellaneous expense categories in total other noninterest expense decreased 6 million  or 6  in 2019 compared to 2018  this decline was primarily attributable to the elimination of the fdic surcharge 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 314 million for 2019  compared to 344 million for 2018  the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 156 for 2019 and 2018  in 2020  we expect our gaap tax rate to be in the range of 17 to 18 

in 2019  our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 “ income taxes ” 

business segments results 

we previously reported our results of operations through two business segments key community bank and key corporate bank with the remaining operations recorded in other in the first quarter of 2019 we underwent a companywide organizational change resulting in the realignment of our businesses into two reportable business segments consumer bank and commercial bank with the remaining operations that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business recorded in other the new business segment structure aligns with how management reviews performance and makes decisions by client segment and business unit prior period information was restated to conform to the new business segment structure 

this section summarizes the highlights and segment imperatives market and business overview and financial performance of our two major business segments operating segments consumer bank and commercial bank note 25 “ business segment reporting ” describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments and provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments dollars in the charts are presented in millions

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

during 2019  common shares outstanding decreased by 423 million shares due to common share repurchases under our 2018 and 2019 capital plans 

at december 31 2019  we had 2795 million treasury shares compared to 2372 million treasury shares at december 31 2018  going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2019  our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1175 at december 31 2019  compared to 1117 at december 31 2018  our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 864 at december 31 2019  compared to 830 at december 31 2018  the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31 2019  calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “basel iii” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

figure 23 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  under the regulatory capital rules information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of keycorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented in note 24 “ shareholders equity ”

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “principles of consolidation and basis of presentation” and in note 13 “ variable interest entities ” 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2019  is presented in note 22 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 24 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 22 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 24 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2019  by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 24 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 





guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 22 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are shown in the following chart and we manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations the table below depicts our risk management hierarchy and associated responsibilities and activities of each group 





market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “ fair value measurements ” in this report 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at december 31 2019  we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy   the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm as the second line of defense is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account key’s covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at december 31 2019  covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 9 million at december 31 2019  and 8 million at december 31 2018  figure 25 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  

figure 25 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



stressed var is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the market risk committee and is calculated at the 99 confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general var the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 51 million at december 31 2019  and at december 31 2018  figure 26 summarizes our stressed var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  

figure 26 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var 

component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was 449 million at december 31 2019  this amount included 163 million of mortgagebacked securities positions and 286 million of assetbacked securities positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the results of this simulation analysis reflect managements desired interest rate risk positioning the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months subject to a 25 basis point floor in rates 

figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  at december 31 2019  our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest the asset sensitive position declined from 2018 as a result of hedging actions executed to guide the position closer to neutral over time tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease subject to a 25 basis point floor in rates in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 55 current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances 

figure 27 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 27  net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5 eg 40 to 45 then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 95 basis points 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain 

residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2019  

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 28 shows all derivative positions that we hold for alm purposes the swap positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

figure 28 portfolio swaps and options by interest rate risk management strategy 





liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure 

that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2019  are shown in figure 29  we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 29 credit ratings 



managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2019  totaled 252 billion  consisting of 240 billion of unpledged securities 140 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 11 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2019  our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 252 billion at the federal 

reserve bank of cleveland and 80 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2019  key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances decreased by 10 billion due to paydowns 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2019  our loantodeposit ratio was 87  which we calculate as the sum of total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 20 “ longterm debt ” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on february 1 2019 keybank issued 600 million of 3300 senior bank notes due february 1 2022 and 400 million of floating rate senior bank notes due february 1 2022 on march 13 2019 keybank issued 350 million of 3900 subordinated bank notes due april 13 2029 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2019  keycorp held 38 billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2019  keybank paid 12 billion in cash dividends to keycorp at january 1 2020  keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 920 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

on april 29 2019 keycorp issued 450 million of 5625 fixedforlife perpetual preferred stock 

on september 11 2019 keycorp issued 750 million of 2550 senior notes due october 1 2029 under its mediumterm note program 

on october 21 2019 keycorp redeemed for cash all of the outstanding 300 million aggregate principal amount of its 6750 senior notes due march 19 2020 

on february 6 2020 keycorp issued 800 million of 2250 senior notes due april 6 2027 under its mediumterm note program 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities partially offset by lower balances held at the federal reserve the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities add financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets as described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 financial instruments — credit losses and as such an expected credit loss methodology specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll the alll at december 31 2019  represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “ asset quality ” 

as shown in figure 30  our alll from continuing operations increased by 17 million  or 19  from december 31 2018  our commercial alll increased by 8 million  or 11  from december 31 2018  primarily due to loan growth over the period and risk rating migration our consumer alll increased by 9 million  or 64  from december 31 2018  the consumer alll increase was primarily due to loan growth and modest shifts in credit quality metrics

net loan chargeoffs 

figure 31 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 32  

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased 190 million  this increase was primarily due to 139 million of chargeoffs related to a previously disclosed fraud loss in 2020  we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points

 nonperforming assets 

figure 33 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets as shown in figure 33  nonperforming assets increased 138 million during 2019  the increase was primarily driven by the transfer of three criticized commercial loans as well as a number of consumer residential mortgages that were moved to nonperforming loans held for sale see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the headings “nonperforming loans” “impaired loans” and “allowance for loan and lease losses” for a summary of our nonaccrual and chargeoff policies

operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee supports the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments the operational risk committee includes attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients 

as described in more detail in “risk management — overview” in item 7 of this report the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board’s risk committee has primary oversight for enterprisewide risk at keycorp including operational risk which includes cybersecurity the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk the erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk including cyberrelated risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not 

audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under gaap 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 

 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly 

comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 





fourth quarter results 

figure 35 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2019 are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 439 million  or 45 per diluted common share compared to 459 million  or 45 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018  

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 127  compared to 137 for the fourth quarter of 2018  the annualized return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations was 1409 for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to 1640 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

te net interest income was 987 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to te net interest income of 10 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018  the decrease in net interest income reflects a lower net interest margin driven by a decline in interest rates and slightly higher deposit costs additionally purchase accounting accretion declined 8 million these declines were partially offset by higher earning asset balances 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 651 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to 645 million for the yearago quarter the increase reflects higher operating lease income as well as growth in corporate services income driven by higher derivatives income investments made in keys mortgage business continue to drive consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 980 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to 10 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018  the fourth quarter of 2019 included notable items of 22 million which consist of a pension settlement charge of 18 million and professional fees related to a previously disclosed fraud loss of 4 million the yearago period included notable items of 41 million which were efficiencyrelated expenses of 24 million and a pension settlement charge of 17 million excluding notable items noninterest expense decreased by 13 million from the yearago period reflecting the successful implementation of keys expense initiatives which drove personnel expenses lower these expenses were partially offset by laurel road acquisition expenses 

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 109 million for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to 59 million for the fourth quarter of 2018  this increase was partially due to a pretax loss related to a previously disclosed fraud incident of 16 million our alll was 900 million  or 95 of total periodend loans at december 31 2019  compared to 

99 at december 31 2018  

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled 99 million  or 42 of average total loans these results compare to 60 million  or 27  for the fourth quarter of 2018  this increase was partially due to a previously disclosed fraud incident 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2019  we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 75 million compared to a tax provision of 92 million for the fourth quarter of 2018  the provision included a tax benefit of 11 million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance against federal and state capital loss carryforwards acquired from first niagara financial group utilized in the quarter the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 140 compared to 159 for the same quarter one year ago 

our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves as described in note 14 “ income taxes ”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the alll is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio in determining the alll we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards concentrations of credit collateral values and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan 

our loss estimates include an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflective of the historical loss riskrating or other indicative data the alll is sensitive to a variety of internal factors such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings the alll is also sensitive to a variety of external factors such as the general health of the economy as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices changes in real estate demand and values interest rates unemployment rates bankruptcy filings fluctuations in the gdp and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts 

since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate alll because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2019  would indicate the need for a 27 million increase in the alll the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 68 million increase in the alll such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 27 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 20 million  or 02 per common share a 68 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 52 million  or 05 per common share 

our accounting policy related to the alll is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” as described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 financial instruments — credit losses and as such an expected credit loss methodology specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll 

valuation methodologies 

fair value measurements 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level 1 valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level 2 valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level 3 valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not 

be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed 

see note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “ fair value measurements ” for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes 

goodwill 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 

under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” although accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required key chose to utilize the quantitative approach in 2019 

the quantitative approach is a two step goodwill impairment test the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on riskbased regulatory capital requirements fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions a multiyear internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry earnings projections for each reporting unit are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capm the buildup to the discount rate includes a riskfree rate 5year adjusted beta based on peer companies a market equity risk premium a size premium and a company specific risk premium the discount rates differ between our reporting units as they have varying levels of risk a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates 

if the fair value determined in step 1 is greater than the carrying value then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired if the fair value is less than the carrying value then the second step is performed which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required in 2019 effective january 1 2020 upon the adoption of asu 201704 the second step of the goodwill impairment test was eliminated 

we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note 12 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives and hedging” and note 8 “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 22 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 22 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2019  

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and all available positive and negative evidence we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 14 “ income taxes ” 

during 2019  we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bhcs commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global institutions that offer financial services some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures the financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry enabling more companies including nonbank companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions mergers and acquisitions have also led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services as we see competitors enter some of our markets or offer similar products we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2018  we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier 1 capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period ending on december 31 2018 “regulatory capital rules” consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for 

purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2018  key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 984 under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules also at december 31 2018 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk would be as set forth in the following table 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 



 

revised prompt corrective action framework 

the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prompt corrective action framework 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action framework 



 we believe that as of december 31 2018  keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

recent regulatory capitalrelated developments 

on september 27 2017 the federal banking agencies issued a joint proposal to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations the “simplification proposal” including key in anticipation of the simplification proposal on august 22 2017 the agencies issued a proposal to extend the 

current capital treatment for certain items that are part of the simplification proposal and also subject to the multiyear transition period for the regulatory capital rules which ended on december 31 2018 the “transitions proposal” the transitions proposal was published as a final rule in the federal register on november 21 2017 and is expected to alleviate the burden that would have resulted from the continued phasein of those capital requirements as the agencies seek public comment on and work to finalize the simplification proposal 

the simplification proposal would amend the regulatory capital rules by 1 replacing the definition for “high volatility commercial real estate” exposures with a simpler definition called “high volatility acquisition development or construction” “hvadc” exposures and requiring a banking organization to assign a 130 percent risk weight to hvadc exposures 2 simplifying the thresholds deductions for mortgage servicing assets temporary difference deferred tax assets that are not realizable through carryback and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions together with revisions to the riskweight treatment for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and 3 simplifying the limitations on the amount of a thirdparty minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary that is includable in regulatory capital these revisions would apply only to standardized approach banking organizations 

the simplification proposal also sets forth clarifying revisions to miscellaneous sections of the regulatory capital rules if the simplification proposal is adopted in its current form as final it would likely have a neutraltolow impact on key’s capital requirements but it would meaningfully alleviate the compliance burden associated with the regulatory capital rules comments on the simplification proposal were due december 26 2017 

in december 2017 the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets “rwas” and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by 1 enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk 2 constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk 3 introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and 4 replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risk  sensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach 

the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committee’s efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements 

subsequently in december 2018 the basel committee released an update to its pillar 3 disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committee’s final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar 3 disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december 2017 

in december 2018 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to amend their regulatory capital rules to address the regulatory capital effects of forthcoming changes to gaap set forth in the issuance by the fasb of asu no 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit loses on financial instruments asu 201613 which introduces the current expected credit loss methodology to replace the incurred loss methodology for financial assets the final rule identifies which credit loss allowances under the new accounting standard are eligible for inclusion in a banking organization’s regulatory capital and provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of adoption of the new accounting standard on retained earnings deferred tax assets credit loss allowances and average total consolidated assets for sec reporting companies such as keycorp the new accounting standard will become effective for the first fiscal year starting after december 15 2019 

additional recent regulatory capitalrelated developments are discussed below under the heading “other regulatory developments  economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act” 

liquidity requirements 

keycorp is subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding banking organizations must satisfy minimum basel iii lcr and nsfr requirements of at least 100 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules establish a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules unless the occ affirmatively determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of keybank’s asset size level of complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system 

under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp must calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and is required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 at december 31 2018  keycorp’s modified lcr was above 100 in the future keycorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp must publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr that discussion may include the main drivers of the modified lcr changes in the modified lcr over time and the causes of such changes the composition of eligible highquality liquid assets concentration of funding sources derivative exposures and potential capital calls any currency mismatch and the centralized liquidity management function of the organization and its interaction with other functional areas keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october 1 2018 

the federal banking agencies commenced implementation of the basel iii nsfr in the united states in april and may 2016 with the release of a proposed rule to implement a minimum net stable funding ratio “nsfr” requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations excluding keycorp and a modified version of the minimum nsfr requirement “modified nsfr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp together with quarterly public disclosure requirements the proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum nsfr requirement of 10 on an ongoing basis however banking organizations that would be subject to the modified nsfr like keycorp would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding equal to 70 of the required stable funding under the nsfr the comment period for the npr expired on august 5 2016 

recent developments regarding liquidity requirements are discussed below under the heading “other regulatory developments  economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act” 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large noncomplex bhc as set forth in a federal reserve guidance document issued on december 18 2015 “sr letter 1519” under sr letter 1519 the federal reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding governance risk management internal controls capital policy capital positions incorporating stressful conditions and events and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules sr letter 1519 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm’s capital planning processes 

the federal reserve’s ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

as part of the ccar the federal reserve conducts a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp filed its 2018 ccar capital plan on april 5 2018 the 2018 ccar results which included the supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating covered companies including keycorp were publicly released by the federal reserve on june 28 2018 that same day the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2018 capital plan 

keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve keycorp and keybank published the results of their companyrun annual stress test on june 21 2018 keycorp published the results of its companyrun midcycle stress test on october 10 2018 summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests have been disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosures and filings” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

on february 5 2019 the federal reserve announced that for 2019 certain lesscomplex bhcs with total consolidated assets between 100 billion and 250 billion including keycorp will not be subject to supervisory stress testing or companyrun stress testing and will not be required to participate in ccar or submit a capital plan to the federal reserve however the federal reserve indicated that each of these firms including keycorp remains subject to the requirement to develop and maintain a capital plan which will have to be reviewed and approved by the firm’s board of directors or committee thereof at least annually keybank like keycorp will not have to conduct a companyrun stress test in 2019 since the occ informed occregulated institutions with total consolidated assets from 100 billion to less than 250 billion that they will not be required to comply with any stress testing requirements in 2019 

recent developments in capital planning and stress testing 

on february 5 2019 the federal reserve finalized a set of changes that will increase the transparency of its stress test program while maintaining the federal reserve’s ability to test the resilience of the nation’s largest most 

complex banks these changes were made to respond to public and industry calls for more transparency around the ccar program 

one of these changes establishes a process for the release of more information regarding the models used by the federal reserve to estimate hypothetical losses in supervisory stress tests under this process the following information will be made available to the public by the federal reserve in the first quarter of each calendar year 1 a range of loss rates estimated using federal reserve models for loans held by ccar firms 2 portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by federal reserve models and 3 more detailed descriptions of the federal reserve’s models such as certain equations and key variables that influence the results of those models 

on february 5 2019 the federal reserve also adopted a stress testing policy statement the policy statement describes the principles policies and procedures that guide the development implementation and validation of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test models and complements the federal reserve’s policy statement on scenario design discussed below 

finally on february 5 2019 the federal reserve amended its policy statement on the scenario design framework for stress testing the amendments 1 clarify when the federal reserve may adopt a change in the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario of less than four percentage points and 2 institute a guide that limits procyclicality in the stress test to the change in the house price index in the severely adverse scenario 

in a separate release published april 10 2018 the federal reserve invited comment on a proposal to integrate certain aspects of the federal reserve’s regulatory capital rules with the ccar and stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to banking organizations subject to the capital plan rule including keycorp under the proposal the federal reserve would 1 amend the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which would be based on the results of an individual banking organization’s supervisory stress test 2 introduce a stress leverage buffer requirement that would replace the existing tier 1 leverage requirement under ccar 3 modify certain assumptions under the supervisory stress test 4 remove the 30 dividend payout ratio limitation as a criterion for heightened supervisory scrutiny of an organization’s capital plan and 5 eliminate the ccar quantitative objection 

under the proposed rule a banking organization would not be subject to any limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it satisfies all minimum capital requirements and its capital conservation requirement as amended to incorporate the stress capital buffer stress leverage buffer requirement and if applicable the advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and supplementary leverage ratio standard the latter two of which do not apply to keycorp the comment period for this proposal ended on june 25 2018 key expects that the proposal would have a marginally favorable impact on its capital requirements 

additional recent developments in capital planning and stress testing are discussed below under the heading “other regulatory developments  economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act” 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “ restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities ” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

as required under the doddfrank act in march 2015 the fdic approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least 10 billion like keybank the surcharge was 45 cents per 100 of the institution’s assessment base after making certain adjustments beginning july 1 2016 keybank was required to pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 135 on november 28 2018 the fdic announced that the dif reserve ratio reached 136 on september 30 2018 exceeding the statutory minimum of 135 the last quarterly surcharge was included in the december 2018 assessments for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more like keybank and no shortfall assessment will be imposed 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the bank’s ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 the fdic has been releasing frequently asked questions for part 370 on a rolling basis and has committed to continue this practice as institutions subject to the rule present issues associated with its implementation that require fdic consultation

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution and recovery plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans is deferred by the regulators on december 1 2017 keycorp submitted its resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic keybank submitted its resolution plan to the fdic on june 20 2018 keycorp was not required to submit a resolution plan in 2018 because the fdic and federal reserve deferred such requirement for 14 firms including keycorp until december 2019 keybank will not be required to submit a resolution plan in 2019 because the fdic extended the next filing due date for all depository institution resolution plan submissions until no sooner than july 1 2020 the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public section of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

on september 28 2016 the occ released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large occregulated institutions including keybank the guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable going concern during a period of severe financial stress because keybank had average total consolidated assets of greater than 100 billion but less than 750 billion as reported on keybank’s consolidated reports of condition and income for the four most recent consecutive quarters as of january 1 2017 it was required to be in compliance with the guidelines no later than january 1 2018 we believe that keybank is in compliance with the guidelines on december 27 2018 however the occ amended its recovery planning guidelines to increase from 50 billion to 250 billion the asset threshold for applying the guidelines to large occregulated institutions keybank is therefore no longer subject to the guidelines 

other regulatory developments 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the volcker rule 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note 6 “ fair value measurements ” in item 8 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 as of december 31 2018 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology 

on june 5 2018 five federal agencies requested public comment on a proposal that would amend the volcker rule the stated objective of the new proposal is to simplify and tailor compliance requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the new proposal would 1 tailor the rule’s compliance requirements based on the size of a firm’s trading assets and liabilities 2 revise the term “trading account” by replacing the shortterm intentbased prong with a new accountingbased prong 3 modify the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions and 4 simplify the trading activity information that a banking entity is required to provide to the agencies in addition to requesting comment on the proposed changes the five agencies requested comment on a large number of specific questions on various issues concerning implementation of the volcker rule the proposal was published in the federal register on july 17 2018 with a 60day comment period the comment period was later extended and expired on october 17 2018 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the resolution plan requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 that same year the federal reserve issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act including 1 the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests 2 liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits monitoring liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer 3 the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management including the requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function and 4 a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

on june 14 2018 the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule limits the aggregate net credit exposure of such a bhc to a single counterparty to 25 of the bhc’s tier 1 capital and limits the aggregate net credit exposure of a global systemically important bank “gsib” to another gsib to 15 of the gsib’s tier 1 capital the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act 

on may 24 2018 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” was enacted egrrcpa made certain amendments to the doddfrank act and other federal banking laws among other things egrrcpa raised from 50 billion to 250 billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively “epss” to bhcs 

egrrcpa raised the asset threshold for applying epss to bhcs in two stages bhcs having total consolidated assets less than 100 billion were no longer subject to such epss immediately upon enactment of this statute bhcs having at least 100 billion but less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp will be no longer subject to these requirements as of 18 months after the date of enactment however under this statute the federal reserve is required after the end of this 18month period to conduct periodic supervisory stress tests of bhcs with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least 50 billion in addition egrrcpa gives the federal reserve the authority following certain notice and comment procedures to continue to apply other epss to any such firm or firms including keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhc’s or bhcs’ capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors the federal reserve is also authorized to exempt any bhc with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion from any eps prior to the end of the 18month period following enactment of egrrcpa 

on october 31 2018 the federal banking agencies issued two nprs related to the implementation of egrrcpa “tailoring nprs” the proposed rules would establish four riskbased categories of banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and apply tailored capital and liquidity requirements to each respective category based on key’s analysis of the proposal keycorp would fall into the least restrictive of those categories “category iv firms” we are assessing the full extent of the impact to key 

in one of the tailoring nprs the federal reserve proposed to amend certain of the epss to apply tailored capital and liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring nprs under this proposal category iv firms like keycorp would be required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly and would be subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than currently required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms would still be required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firm’s internal liquidity stress test and would remain subject to monthly tailored fr 2052a liquidity reporting requirements also under this proposal category iv firms like keycorp would no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun capital stress tests and would be subject to a supervisory capital stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case the federal reserve indicated that it intends to issue a proposal in the future that would align the capital plan requirements applicable to category iv firms to the changes in capital stress testing requirements being proposed and in that future proposal the federal reserve plans to provide these firms with greater flexibility to develop their annual capital plans the federal reserve further indicated that it plans to propose that the stress capital buffer that would be applicable to category iv firms would be calculated in a manner that would align with the proposed twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle 

in the other tailoring npr the federal banking agencies proposed to amend certain elements of their regulatory capital rules and standardized liquidity requirements to apply tailored capital and liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring nprs under this proposal category iv firms like keycorp would not be subject to the lcr or the proposed nsfr standardized liquidity requirements therefore if the proposal is adopted keycorp would no longer be subject to the modified lcr or the proposed modified nsfr the federal banking agencies also proposed that category iv firms would not be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer or the supplementary leverage ratio and would be allowed to opt out of including most elements of aoci in regulatory capital under the current regulatory capital rules keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer or the supplementary leverage ratio and is allowed to opt out of including aoci elements in regulatory capital so that part of the proposal would not impact keycorp comments on the tailoring nprs were due by january 22 2019 

in addition to raising the asset threshold for the application of epss to bhcs egrrcpa raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement in section 165i2 of the doddfrank act for federallyregulated banks like keybank to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from 10 billion to 250 billion in total consolidated assets this provision is effective 18 months after the date of enactment of egrrcpa in december 2018 and january 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to implement this statutory change under this proposal federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than 250 billion like keybank would no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests while banks above this threshold would be required to conduct companyrun stress tests every other year or in some cases every year also this proposal would remove the “adverse” scenario as a required scenario for all companyrun and supervisory stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests would be required to include only “baseline” and “severely adverse” scenarios the comment period for this proposal was scheduled to end on february 19 2019 but was extended until march 14 2019 by the occ and until march 21 2019 by the federal reserve 

egrrcpa also amended the capital requirements for certain acquisition development and construction “adc” loans this statute allows the federal banking agencies to require depository institutions to assign a heightened risk weight to a high volatility commercial real estate “hvcre” exposure under the regulatory capital rules only if such exposure comes within the definition of an hvcre adc loan as defined in egrrcpa the effect of this provision is to narrow the scope of exposures subject to a heightened risk weight on july 6 2018 the federal banking agencies issued a statement providing depository institutions including keybank and bhcs including keycorp with interim guidance concerning the application of this provision on september 18 2018 the federal banking agencies released a proposal to amend their regulatory capital rules to revise the definition of an hvcre exposure to conform to the statutory definition of an hvcre adc loan and indicated that they would not take any further action on the hvadc aspect of the simplification proposal issued by the agencies in september 2017 in light of the changes made by egrrcpa the agencies requested comment on various interpretive issues relating to this proposal this proposal was published in the federal register on september 28 2018 and comments were due by november 27 2018 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of 1 the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser 2 credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and 3 transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

supervision and governance 

on november 2 2018 the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more like keycorp “lfi rating system” in order to align the federal reserve’s rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institution’s capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and 

governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve intends to assign initial ratings under the lfi rating system in 2019 to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and in 2020 for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp 

  

the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system is the subject of two separate but related proposals 1 proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and 2 proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors published by the federal reserve on august 3 2017 identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution’s governance and controls the proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the federal reserve most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization’s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors in addition the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in federal reserve supervision and regulation letters that could be eliminated or revised the federal reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until february 15 2018 

on january 4 2018 the federal reserve released the final proposal related to the lfi rating system  the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm’s board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march 15 2018 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act “cra” was enacted in 1977 to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome “lmi” neighborhoods consistent with the institutions’ safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods 

on september 5 2018 the occ published in the federal register an advance notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” requesting public input on ways to revise the agency’s cra regulations to update the framework by which the occ assesses a bank’s cra performance the occ stated that the purpose of updating the agency’s cra 

regulations is to encourage more community and economic development in areas that need it most bring greater clarity consistency and certainty to the cra evaluation process and provide flexibility to accommodate banks with different business strategies the occ invited comments on a number of questions including ones that concern the use of a metricsbased framework the redefinition of assessment areas and the expansion of craqualifying activities comments on the anpr were due by november 19 2018 any revision to the occ’s cra regulations would apply to national banks including keybank 




 item 1a risk factors 

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 74 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover the debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs outpace the estimate in our current methodology used to establish our alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrict and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which previously increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarlysituated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels although most parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other significant regulations have been enacted with upcoming effective dates as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results for example in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that will effective january 1 2020 substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations the standard removes the existing “probable” threshold in gaap for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the standard is likely to have a negative impact potentially materially on the allowance for loan and lease losses and capital at adoption in 2020 however key is still evaluating the impact it is also possible that key’s ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition our ability to extend protections to customers’ information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations or resulted in any material disruption of our operations or 

material harm to our customers such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm over the last few years several large companies have disclosed that they suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a significant impact on us 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well 

designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

additionally an extended period of shutdown of portions of the federal government could negatively impact the financial performance of certain customers and could negatively impact customers’ future access to certain loan and guaranty programs 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the new liquidity standards required us to increase our holdings of higherquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies’ actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment in the future federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns as the federal reserve gradually reverses quantitative easing and reduces the size of its balance sheet in addition new initiatives or 

legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and begins to reverse quantitative easing the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin 

moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

uncertainty about the future of libor may adversely affect our business 

on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the “authority” which regulates libor announced that the authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor and no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york additionally the international swaps and derivatives association inc launched a consultation on technical issues related to new benchmark fallbacks for derivatives contracts that reference certain interbank offered rates including libor seeking industry input thereon at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of the authority’s announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect keycorp’s financial condition and results of operations 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and continued improvement in the overall us economy may not result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

tax reform is anticipated to have an impact on our tax liabilities the tax liabilities of our clients and how we do business 

on december 22 2017 the tcj act was signed into law this comprehensive tax legislation provides for significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended that impact corporate taxation requirements such as the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tcj act retains the lowincome housing and research and development credits and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax other relevant changes include earlier recognition of certain revenue accelerating expensing of investments in tangible property including leasing assets and limiting several deductions such as net business interest mortgage and home equity interest certain executive compensation and meals and entertainment expense additionally it doubles the standard deduction thereby eliminating the need to itemize deductions for a large number of individual taxpayers 

key continues to assess the overall impact of the tcj act on the future expected federal income tax obligations of our clients we expect that key’s future federal income tax liabilities will overall benefit from the provisions in the tcj act as we experienced in 2018 however we also expect that certain aspects of our business may change over time based on how the provisions in the tcj act may affect our customers and influence how we offer and deliver our products and services in the future refer to note 13 “ income taxes ” for information on the impact of the tcj act to our 2018 financial results 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring expanding and retaining targeted client relationships our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered 

consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

our incentive compensation structure and sales practices are subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara 

keycorp consummated its merger with first niagara on august 1 2016 we continue to focus on realizing growth opportunities from the merger including among other things enhanced revenues revenue synergies and an expanded market reach if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating incurred loan and lease losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk such as setting reserves and for 

capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and being compatible to the available data these assumptions have certain limitations and may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not fully capture or express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we may not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

results of operations 

earnings overview 

the following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders for the year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2018 dollars in millions 



net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

to make it easier to compare both the results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “te basis” ie as if all income were taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 126 an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 would yield 100 prior to 2018 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35 would yield 100 

figure 1 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin 

which is an indicator of the profitability of our earning assets less the cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

te net interest income for 2018 was 39 billion  and the net interest margin was 317  compared to te net interest income of 38 billion and a net interest margin of 317 for the prior year both net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the benefit from higher earning asset balances and yields partly offset by higher deposit betas and lower purchase accounting accretion te net interest income for 2017 increased 877 million from 2016 and the net interest margin increased by 25 basis points 2017 included the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition including purchase accounting accretion in addition 2017 benefited from higher interest rates low deposit betas and growth in core earning asset balances in 2019 we expect te net interest income to be in the range of 40 billion to 41 billion with our outlook assuming no additional interest rate increases in 2019 

 

average loans totaled 883 billion for 2018  compared to 864 billion in 2017  the increase reflects broadbased growth in commercial and industrial loans and indirect auto lending partially offset by lower levels of utilization and higher paydowns in commercial real estate and construction loans and home equity lines of credit for 2019  we anticipate average loans to be in the range of 90 billion to 91 billion 

average deposits totaled 1051 billion for 2018  an increase of 21 billion compared to 2017  reflecting growth in higheryielding deposit products as well as strength in key’s retail banking franchise and growth from commercial relationships  for 2019  we anticipate average deposits to be in the range of 108 billion to 109 billion

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 246 million for 2018  compared to 229 million for 2017  and 266 million for 2016  the increase of 17 million in our provision for credit losses is related to an increase in our alll taken during 2018 on our commercial loan portfolio when compared to the year prior and an increase in net loan chargeoffs in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio  for 2017  the decrease of 37 million in our provision for credit losses was related to a decrease in our alll taken during 2017 on our commercial loan portfolio when compared to the year prior partially offset by a slight increase in our net loan chargeoffs over the same period of time in 2019 we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan chargeoffs to provide for loan growth 

noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2018 was 25 billion  compared to 25 billion during 2017  and 21 billion during 2016  noninterest income represented 39 of total revenue for 2018  39 of total revenue for 2017  and 41 of total revenue for 2016  in 2019 we expect noninterest income to be in the range of 25 billion to 26 billion 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 3 noninterest income 

 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2018  trust and investment services income decreased 36 million  or 67  from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in insurance commissions as a result of the sale of kibs in the second quarter of 2018 partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in custody and agent revenue and personal trust revenue 

for 2017  trust and investment services income increased 71 million or 153 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in insurance and brokerage commissions due to the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition and higher fees earned from investment management services as a result of stronger market performance 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2018  our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets 

under management of 368 billion  compared to 396 billion at december 31 2017  and 366 billion at december 31 2016  the decrease from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to the market depreciation during the second half of 2018 the increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to market appreciation during 2017 

figure 4 assets under management 



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2018  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 47 million  or 78  from the prior year due to growth in investment banking advisory fees partially driven by the full year impact of the cain brothers acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017 

for 2017  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 121 million or 251 from the prior year primarily driven by growth in financial advisory debt financing and mortgage banking fees from our core franchises as well as the acquisition of cain brothers 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income decreased 17 million  or 59  in 2018 compared to 2017  cards and payments income and other expense were both impacted by the 2018 adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard the new accounting standard had no impact to net income during 2018 when applying current accounting guidance to both years cards and payments income increased for 2018 due to growth in credit and debit card fees purchase and prepaid card fees and merchant services income 

cards and payments income increased 54 million or 232 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher volumes in atm debit card purchase and prepaid cards and merchant services 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts decreased 8 million  or 22  in 2018 compared to the prior year service charges on deposit accounts increased 55 million or 18 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition and investments in commercial payments 

other noninterest income 

other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income mortgage servicing fees and other income other noninterest income increased 51 million or 73 in 2018 compared to 2017  other income included a 78 million gain related to the sale of kibs during the second quarter of 2018 compared to a 64 million gain from acquiring the remaining ownership in a merchant services joint venture in the second quarter of 2017 corporate services income also contributed to the increase due to higher derivative income 

other noninterest income increased 106 million or 180 in 2017 compared to 2016  drivers include a full year impact of first niagara a onetime gain related to key’s merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 higher lease originations driving an increase in operating lease income and growth from investments in the residential mortgage business  

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2018 was 40 billion  compared to 41 billion for 2017  and 38 billion for 2016  figure 5 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  in 2019  we expect noninterest expense to be in the range of 385 billion to 395 billion 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 5 noninterest expense 

 

personnel 

as shown in figure 6  personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 31 million  or 14  in 2018 compared to 2017  the increase was partially due to recent acquisitions as well as accelerated technology investments and higher severance expense 

personnel expense increased by 230 million or 112 from 2016 to 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition and the cain brothers acquisition in october 2017 in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding driven by business performance improvements of both cashbased incentive plans and performance based stockawards 

figure 6 personnel expense 



 

net occupancy 

net occupancy expense decreased 23 million  or 69  in 2018 compared to 2017  primarily due to lower property reserves rental expenses and lease termination fees 

net occupancy expense increased 26 million or 85 in 2017 compared to 2016  primarily due to the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition 

other noninterest expense 

other noninterest expense includes equipment operating lease expense marketing fdic assessment intangible asset amortization oreo expenses and other miscellaneous expense categories in total other noninterest expense decreased 108 million or 101 in 2018 compared to 2017  the declines in other expense were primarily driven by 20 million charitable contributions made in both the first and second quarters of 2017 other miscellaneous expenses also declined from one year ago 

other noninterest expense increased 159 million or 174 in 2017 compared to 2016  primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of first niagara growth was also driven by on  going investments and business acquisitions during 2017 including the build out of the residential mortgage platform and our recent acquisitions  

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 344 million for 2018  compared to 637 million for 2017  and 179 million for 2016  the decrease in tax provision from 2017 to 2018 was driven by the tcj act the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 156 for 2018  compared to 330 for 2017  and 185 for 2016  in 2019 we expect our gaap tax rate to be in the range of 18 to 19 

in 2018 our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects periodic adjustments to our tax reserves and the impact of the tcj act as described in note 13 “ income taxes ”

key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 8  key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 942 million for 2018  compared to 658 million for 2017  and 372 million for 2016  the increase in 2018 was primarily due to growth in key’s core businesses expense discipline and a lower tax rate as a result of tax reform 

te net interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase is primarily due to the benefit from higher interest rates and balance sheet growth partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion average loans and leases increased largely driven by a 10 billion or 55 increase in commercial and industrial loans additionally average deposits increased due to strength in our relationship strategy 

noninterest income decreased from 2017 driven by other income which included a onetime gain related to key’s merchant services acquisition in 2017 additionally deposit service charges and cards and payments income decreased from 2017 these line items were negatively impacted by the 2018 adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard when applying current accounting guidance to both years these line items grew from the prior year related to continued household and relationship growth trust and investment services income increased from 2017 primarily driven by higher average assets under management benefiting from market growth during the first three quarters of 2018 

the provision for credit losses decreased from 2017 as credit quality remained stable 

noninterest expense was relatively flat from 2017 as ongoing business investments were partially offset by continued expense discipline across key community bank businesses 

in 2017 key community bank’s net income attributable to key increased from the prior year te net interest income increased from 2016 the increase in te net interest income is primarily related to a fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition te net interest income also benefited from growth in core businesses and higher interest rates noninterest income increased from 2016 driven by the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in key’s core businesses growth in key’s core businesses included higher trust and investment services income due to market growth of assets under management strength in cards and payments and higher deposit service charges  the provision for credit losses increased from 2016 primarily related to loan growth in 2017 noninterest expense increased from 2016 primarily related to a full  year impact of first niagara in addition to the

key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 9  key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 789 million for 2018  compared to 818 million for 2017 and 626 million for 2016  the 2018 decrease was driven by a decrease in revenue higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense 

te net interest income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 this decrease is primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion relative to last year as well as loan spread compression loan balances increased mostly due to growth in commercial and industrial loans with broadbased growth across key’s industry verticals deposit balances decreased due to the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits offsetting growth in core deposits 

noninterest income increased from 2017 the majority of the increase is related to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees with growth in financial advisory and mortgage banking fees from our core key franchise 

as well as the full year impact of the acquisition of cain brothers corporate services income increased driven by growth in derivatives revenue mortgage fees increased related to our third party loan servicing operation slightly offsetting these increases is a decline in trust and investment services income mostly due to lower fixed income commissions and a decline in other noninterest income as 2017 had a gain related to our merchant services business and lower gains on certain taxadvantaged assets  

the provision for credit losses increased from 2017 primarily due to higher net loan chargeoffs and higher provisioning related to growth in the loan portfolio 

noninterest expense increased from 2017 personnel expense increased due to higher salaries partially related to a full year impact of the acquisition of cain brothers nonpersonnel expense increased due to higher operating lease expense related to higher volumes and higher intangible amortization expense related to acquisitions 

in 2017 key corporate bank’s net income attributable to key increased from the prior year te net interest income increased compared to 2016 due to higher balances related to the first niagara acquisition and growth in core businesses noninterest income increased due to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees operating lease and other leasing gains and cards and payments income the provision for credit losses decreased primarily due to lower net loan chargeoffs and lower provisioning related to improving credit quality in the overall portfolio noninterest expense increased due to higher salaries incentive compensation benefits and stockbased compensation expense partially related to the acquisition of cain brothers as well as higher performancebased compensation nonpersonnel expense increased due to higher operating lease expense cards and payments processing and other various expenses related to the acquisition of cain brothers

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 663 billion at december 31 2018  an increase of 36 billion  or 57  compared to december 31 2017  primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial loans

figure 11 commercial loans by industry 

  

commercial and industrial    commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio representing 51 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2018  and 48 at december 31 2017  this portfolio is approximately 84 variable rate and consists of loans originated in both key corporate and community bank to large corporate middle market and small business clients 

commercial and industrial loans totaled 458 billion at december 31 2018  an increase of 39 billion compared to december 31 2017  driven by increases in the finance utilities oil and gas and consumer services industries which combined accounted for approximately 32 of the total portfolio mix at december 31 2018

figure 12 commercial real estate loans 



consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding at december 31 2018  totaled 232 billion  a decrease of 430 million  or 18  from one year ago the decrease in consumer loans was driven by continued declines in the home equity loan portfolio largely the result of paydowns in home equity lines of credit partly offset by growth in indirect auto lending 

the home equity portfolio is comprised of loans originated by our key community bank within our 15state footprint and is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio representing approximately 48 of consumer loans outstanding at year end 

as shown in figure 8  we held the first lien position for approximately 60 of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2018  and 60 at december 31 2017  for loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fico scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratios this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses”

securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

capital 

the objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments we have identified three primary uses of capital 

 

the following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital for further information see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 23 “ shareholders equity ”

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 12 “ variable interest entities ” 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2018  is presented in note 21 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 24 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 21 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are shown in the following chart and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations the table below depicts our risk management hierarchy and associated responsibilities and activities of each group

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “ fair value measurements ” in this report 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of 

trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at december 31 2018  we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy   the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm as the second line of defense is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account key’s covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at december 31 2018  covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations 

over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 8 million at december 31 2018  and 7 million at december 31 2017  figure 25 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

figure 25 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



stressed var is calculated by running the portfolios through a predetermined stress period which is approved by the market risk committee and is calculated at the 99 confidence level using the same model and assumptions used for general var the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 51 million at december 31 2018  and 45 million at december 31 2017  figure 26 summarizes our stressed var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

figure 26 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 



internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was 60 million at december 31 2018  this amount included 58 million of mortgagebacked securities positions and 2 million of assetbacked securities positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a 

standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the results of this simulation analysis reflect managements desired interest rate risk positioning the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months due to the low interest rate environment as of year end 2017 our standard decrease scenario was modified to a gradual parallel decrease of 125 basis points over eight months with no change over the following four months as of december 31 2018 the standard 200 basis point decline has been reinstated 

figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  at december 31 2018  our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderately assetsensitive in 2018 the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate which led to an increase in the magnitude 

of the declining rate scenario to 200 basis points tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 200 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 55 current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances 

figure 27 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 27  net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 25 basis points if the interest bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5 eg 40 to 45 then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 85 basis points 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2018  

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities during the three months ended september 30 2018 we terminated 52 billion of swaps that were scheduled to mature in 2019 and invested in interest rate floor contracts to enhance our asset sensitivity position and maintain our moderate risk profile 

figure 28 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

figure 28 portfolio swaps and options by interest rate risk management strategy 





liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2018  are shown in figure 29  we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 29 credit ratings 



managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2018  totaled 242 billion consisting of 217 billion of unpledged securities 201 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 24 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2018  our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 254 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 73 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2018  key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances increased by 24 million due to additional borrowings 

final us liquidity coverage ratio 

under the liquidity coverage rules we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key at december 31 2018  our estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

additional information about the liquidity coverage rules and modified lcr is included in the “supervision and regulation” section under the heading “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” in item 1 of this report 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2018  our loantodeposit ratio was 856  which we calculate as the sum of total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 19 “ longterm debt ” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on march 7 2018 keybank issued 500 million of 3375 senior bank notes due march 7 2023 under its global bank note program on june 13 2018 keybank issued 500 million of 335 senior bank notes due june 15 2021 under its global bank note program 

on september 28 2018 keybank again updated its bank note program authorizing the issuance of up to 20 

billion of notes as of december 31 2018 no notes had been issued under the 2018 bank note program and 20 

billion remained available for issuance 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of month into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2018  keycorp held 32 billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected 

obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2018  keybank paid 17 billion in dividends to keycorp at january 1 2019  keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 10 billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

on april 30 2018 keycorp issued 750 million of 410 senior notes due april 30 2028 under its mediumterm note program on october 29 2018 keycorp issued 500 million of 415 senior notes due october 29 2025 under its mediumterm note program 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has decreased as a result of a decrease in unpledged securities and lower balances held at the federal reserve the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 33 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2018  as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 1 million in taxes to be paid we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2018  

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities add financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets the alll at december 31 2018  represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “ asset quality ” 

as shown in figure 30  our alll from continuing operations increased by 6 million  or 7  from december 31 2017  our commercial alll increased by 8 million  or 11  from december 31 2017  primarily due to loan growth over the period our consumer alll decreased by 2 million  or 14  from december 31 2017  the consumer alll was impacted by declining loan balances and favorable shifts in credit quality

net loan chargeoffs 

figure 31 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 32  

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased 26 million  this increase was driven by an increase in net loan chargeoffs in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio in 2019  we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points

 nonperforming assets 

figure 33 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets as shown in figure 33  nonperforming assets increased 43 million during 2018  the increase was largely in our real estate — commercial mortgage portfolio driven by several credits that were not concentrated in a particular industry or geography see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the headings “nonperforming loans” “impaired loans” and “allowance for loan and lease losses” for a summary of our nonaccrual and chargeoff policies

figure 34 summary of changes in nonperforming loans from continuing operations 





operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee supports the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments the operational risk committee includes attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients 

as described in more detail in “risk management  overview” in item 7 of this report the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board’s risk committee has primary oversight for enterprisewide risk at keycorp including operational risk which includes cybersecurity the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk the erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk including cyberrelated risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee 

gaap to nongaap reconciliations 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not 

audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under gaap 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 

 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly 

comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors to evaluate how effectively management is controlling noninterest expenses in generating revenue as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the alll is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio in determining the alll we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards concentrations of credit collateral values and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan 

our loss estimates include an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflective of the historical loss riskrating or other indicative data the alll is sensitive to a variety of internal factors such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings the alll is also sensitive to a variety of external factors such as the general health of the economy as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices changes in real estate demand and values interest rates unemployment rates bankruptcy filings fluctuations in the gdp and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts 

since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate alll because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2018  would indicate the need for a 23 million increase in the alll the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 66 million increase in the alll such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 23 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 18 million  or 02 per common share a 66 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 51 million  or 05 per common share 

our accounting policy related to the alll is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

fair value measurements 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level 1 valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level 2 valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level 3 valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not 

be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed 

see note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “ fair value measurements ” for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes 

goodwill 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we chose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values our reporting units for purposes of the analysis are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 

if we chose the quantitative assessment we would perform the two step goodwill impairment test the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on riskbased regulatory capital requirements fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions a multiyear internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry earnings projections for both reporting units are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capital asset pricing model “capm” the buildup to the discount rate includes a riskfree rate 5year adjusted beta based on peer companies a market equity risk premium a size premium and a company specific risk premium the discount rates differ between our two reporting segments as they have different levels of risk  key corporate bank generally has a higher discount rate due to a higher level of perceived risk related to its service offerings and asset mix a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill impairment may be indicated in such a case we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing and we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value then we would compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill the impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to earnings we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note 11 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices on january 1 2018 we early adopted revised derivative and hedging accounting guidance for additional information on the adoption of this guidance refer to the table in note 1 under the heading “accounting guidance adopted in 2018” additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives and hedging” and note 8 “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 21 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 21 “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2018  

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 13 “ income taxes ” 

during 2018  we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that they are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the 

federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as an fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2017  we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier 1 capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital 

buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period ending on december 31 2018 “regulatory capital rules” consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2017 key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 1005  under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules also at december 31 2017 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk would be as set forth in the following table 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin

revised prompt corrective action framework 

the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prompt corrective action framework 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action framework 





we believe that as of december 31 2017  keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

recent regulatory capitalrelated developments 

on september 27 2017 the federal banking agencies issued a joint proposal to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations the “simplification proposal” including key in anticipation of the simplification proposal on august 22 2017 the agencies issued a proposal to extend the current capital treatment for certain items that are part of the simplification proposal and also subject to the multiyear transition period for the regulatory capital rules which ends on december 31 2018 the “transitions proposal” the transitions proposal was published as a final rule in the federal register on november 21 2017 and is expected to alleviate the burden that would have resulted from the continued phasein of those capital requirements as the agencies seek public comment on and work to finalize the simplification proposal 

the simplification proposal would amend the regulatory capital rules by 1 replacing the definition for “high volatility commercial real estate” exposures with a simpler definition called “high volatility acquisition development or construction” “hvadc” exposures and requiring a banking organization to assign a 130 percent risk weight to hvadc exposures 2 simplifying the thresholds deductions for mortgage servicing assets temporary difference deferred tax assets that are not realizable through carryback and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions together with revisions to the riskweight treatment for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and 3 simplifying the limitations on the amount of a thirdparty minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary that is includable in regulatory capital these revisions would apply only to standardized approach banking organizations 

the simplification proposal also sets forth clarifying revisions to miscellaneous sections of the regulatory capital rules if the simplification proposal is adopted in its current form as final it would likely have a neutraltolow impact on key’s capital requirements but it would meaningfully alleviate the compliance burden associated with the regulatory capital rules comments on the simplification proposal were due december 26 2017 

in december 2017 the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets “rwas” and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by 1 enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk 2 constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment “cva” risk and operational risk 3 introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and 4 replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risk  sensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach 

the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committee’s efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements 

liquidity requirements 

keycorp is subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding banking organizations must satisfy minimum basel iii lcr and nsfr requirements of at least 100 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules establish a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules unless the occ affirmatively determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of keybank’s asset size level of complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system 

under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp must calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and is required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 at december 31 2017  keycorp’s modified lcr was above 100 in the future keycorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp must publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr that discussion may include the main drivers of the modified lcr changes in the modified lcr over time and the causes of such changes the composition of eligible highquality liquid assets concentration of funding sources derivative exposures and potential capital calls any currency mismatch and the centralized liquidity management function of the organization and its interaction with other functional areas keycorp must comply with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october 1 2018 and subsequent quarters 

the federal banking agencies commenced implementation of the basel iii nsfr in the united states in april and may 2016 with the release of a proposed rule to implement a minimum net stable funding ratio “nsfr” requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations excluding keycorp and a modified version of the minimum nsfr requirement “modified nsfr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp together with quarterly public disclosure requirements the proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum nsfr requirement of 10 on an ongoing basis however banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr like keycorp would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding equal to 70 of the required stable funding under the nsfr the comment period for the npr expired on august 5 2016 if the proposed nsfr requirement is adopted as a final rule then similar to actions taken in connection with the implementation of the liquidity coverage rules keycorp may adjust its balance sheet or modify product offerings to enhance its liquidity position 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of 

many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large noncomplex bhc as set forth in a federal reserve guidance document issued on december 18 2015 “sr letter 1519” under sr letter 1519 the federal reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding governance risk management internal controls capital policy capital positions incorporating stressful conditions and events and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules sr letter 1519 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm’s capital planning processes 

the federal reserve’s annual ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

as part of the annual ccar the federal reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined annually by the federal reserve keycorp filed its 2017 ccar capital plan on april 5 2017 the 2017 ccar results which included the annual supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating covered companies including keycorp were publicly released by the federal reserve on june 28 2017 that same day the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2017 capital plan 

keycorp and keybank must also conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank must only conduct an annual stress test keycorp must conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and occ keycorp is required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve keycorp and keybank published the results of their companyrun annual stress test on june 22 2017 keycorp published the results of its companyrun midcycle stress test on october 26 2017 summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests are disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosures and filings” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

recent developments in capital planning and stress testing 

on january 30 2017 the federal reserve released a final rule to revise the capital plan and stress test rules as they apply to large noncomplex bhcs and us intermediaries of foreign banks under the final rule a large noncomplex bhc is one with total consolidated assets of more than 50 billion but less than 250 billion and nonbank assets of less than 75 billion “covered bhcs” this includes keycorp 

the final rule provides relief from the compliance requirements associated with the federal reserve’s capital plan and stress test rules specifically the final rule relieves covered bhcs from the qualitative assessment portion of the federal reserve’s ccar program and modifies the reporting requirements for these organizations by reducing the reporting requirements applicable to covered bhcs under the fr y14a and raising the materiality thresholds for specific portfolio reporting requirements going forward the federal reserve will assess the capital planning practices of covered bhcs in a manner similar to existing supervisory programs which typically include the distribution of a first day letter in advance of the start date of the review standard communication during the exam lead time to meet requests for additional information and sufficient time frames to address the findings of the review 

the final rule also limits the amount of capital a covered bhc is authorized to distribute in excess of the amount set forth in its capital plan without federal reserve approval the “de minimis exception” and establishes a onequarter blackout period during which a bhc is not permitted to submit a notice to use the de minimis exception or seek prior approval to make a capital distribution in an amount that exceeds the de minimis exception level if exigent circumstances arise during the blackout period that require a capital distribution a covered bhc may 

resubmit its capital plan and request expedited review from the federal reserve however the federal reserve is not required to expedite the review process 

the final rule also requires covered bhcs to measure nonbank assets on a monthly basis and report the average throughout the quarter to the federal reserve on a quarterly basis beginning march 31 2017 

the final rule became effective 30 days after publication in the federal register and therefore the relief provided under the final rule from the qualitative assessment portion of the ccar program was effective for the 2017 ccar cycle 

on december 7 2017 the federal reserve released for public comment a package of proposals that would increase the transparency of its stress test program while maintaining the federal reserve’s ability to test the resilience of the nation’s largest most complex banks the proposals responded to public and industry calls for more transparency around the ccar program 

one of the proposals titled “enhanced disclosure of the models used in the federal reserve’s supervisory stress tests” sets forth a process for the release of more information regarding the models used by the federal reserve to estimate hypothetical losses in stress tests including as applied in the ccar context for the first time this would make the following information available to the public 1 a range of loss rates estimated using federal reserve models for loans held by ccar firms 2 portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by federal reserve models and 3 more detailed descriptions of the federal reserve’s models such as certain equations and key variables that influence the results of those models 

the federal reserve was also seeking comment on a proposed stress testing policy statement the policy statement describes the principles policies and procedures that guide the development implementation and validation of the federal reserve’s supervisory stress test models and would complement the federal reserve’s policy statement on scenario design discussed below 

finally the federal reserve is proposing to amend its policy statement on the scenario design framework for stress testing the proposed amendments would 1 clarify when the federal reserve may adopt a change in the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario of less than four percentage points 2 institute a countercyclical guide for the change in the house price index in the severely adverse scenario 3 and provide notice that the federal reserve plans to incorporate wholesale funding costs for banking organizations in the scenarios the federal reserve would continue to use the policy statement to develop the macroeconomic scenarios and additional scenario components that are used in the supervisory and companyrun stress tests conducted under the federal reserve’s stress tests rules comments on these proposals were due january 22 2018 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 4  “ restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities ” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

as required under the doddfrank act in march 2015 the fdic approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least 10 billion like keybank the surcharge is 45 cents per 100 of the institution’s assessment base after making certain adjustments the final rule became effective on july 1 2016 as of july 1 2016 keybank must pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 135 surcharges will continue through the quarter that the dif reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 135 but not later than december 31 2018 if the reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 provided it is at least 115 the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on march 31 2019 on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more like keybank 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the keybank ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution and recovery plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually usually by december 31 of each year for 2015 these resolution plans the third required from keycorp and keybank were submitted on december 1 2015 keycorp and keybank were not required to submit resolution plans for 2016 because the fdic and federal reserve deferred such requirement for 38 firms including keycorp until december 2017 and the fdic deferred such requirement for a number of insured depository institutions including keybank until july 1 2018 the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank after they are submitted the public section of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

on september 28 2016 the occ released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large occregulated institutions including keybank the guidelines require such institutions to establish a 

comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable going concern during a period of severe financial stress under the final guidelines an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events escalation procedures recovery options and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors the recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity scope of operations and risk profile of the institution because keybank had average total consolidated assets of greater than 100 billion but less than 750 billion as reported on keybank’s consolidated reports of condition and income for the four most recent consecutive quarters as of january 1 2017 it was required to be in compliance with the guidelines no later than january 1 2018 we believe that keybank is in compliance with the guidelines 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the volcker rule 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading “other investments” in item 7 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 as of december 31 2017 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the resolution plan requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 that same year the federal reserve issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act including 1 the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests 2 liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits monitoring liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer 3 the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management including the requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function and 4 a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

in march 2016 the federal reserve issued an npr proposing to establish a minimum sccl for bhcs with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more like keycorp this proposal would implement a provision in the doddfrank act and replaces proposals on this subject issued by the federal reserve in 2011 and 2012 under the proposal a covered bhc including keycorp would not be allowed to have an aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25 of the consolidated capital stock and surplus of the covered bhc global systemicallyimportant banks and certain other large bhcs excluding keycorp would be subject to stricter limits under the proposal a covered bhc such as keycorp would be required to comply with the proposed limits and quarterly reporting to show such compliance starting two years after the effective date of a final rule the comment period for the npr expired on june 3 2016 keycorp does not expect to be materially impacted by this proposal if it is adopted as a final rule the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including 

keycorp kbcm and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of 1 the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser 2 credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and 3 transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

supervision and governance 

on august 3 2017 the federal reserve published an npr to align its supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including keycorp with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the “lfi rating system” if adopted in final form the lfi rating system would provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and assess an institution’s capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system would be rated using the following scale satisfactory satisfactory watch deficient1 and deficient2 with the satisfactory watch rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation 

the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system is the subject of two separate but related proposals 1 proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and 2 proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institution’s governance and controls the proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the federal reserve most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organization’s senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors in addition the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in federal reserve sr letters that could be eliminated or revised the federal reserve extended the comment period for the proposed lfi rating system and the guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until february 15 2018 

on january 4 2018 the federal reserve released the final component of the proposed lfi rating system —  the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firm’s board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal are due by march 15 2018 

erisa fiduciary standard 

in april 2016 the department of labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under erisa for making investment advice recommendations to i certain retirement plan fiduciaries participants or beneficiaries and ii owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts among other retirement plans the purpose of the rules is to place fiduciary obligations rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply on these service providers accordingly the rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations 

under erisa such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer under the department of labor’s original rules the impartial standard requirement for financial institutions and their advisors was to become effective april 10 2017 however in response to a presidential order the department of labor extended the effective date to june 9 2017 the contract provisions were to be in place by january 1 2018 however on november 29 2017 the department of labor extended the applicability of the contract rules until july 1 2019 while it continues to review requested comments concerning whether to modify further delay or rescind these rules in whole or in part 




 item 1a risk   factors   

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 73  of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover the debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs outpace the estimate in our current methodology used to establish our alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrain and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which previously increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank has faced scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly due to keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts continue to be implemented as well as other significant regulations which have been enacted with upcoming effective dates as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act and other significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of 

collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the new liquidity standards required us to increase our holdings of higherquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment in light of recent moderate improvements in the us economy federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns as the federal reserve gradually reverses quantitative easing and reduces the size of its balance sheet in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 



we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and begins to reverse quantitative easing the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin 

moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and continued improvement in the overall us economy may not result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the real estate and healthcare market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

tax reform is anticipated to have an impact on our tax liabilities the tax liabilities of our clients and how we do business 

on december 22 2017 the tcj act was signed into law this comprehensive tax legislation provides for significant changes to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended that impact corporate taxation requirements such as the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the tcj act retains the lowincome housing and research and development credits and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax other relevant corporate changes include earlier recognition of certain revenue accelerating expensing of investments in tangible property including leasing assets and limiting several deductions such as fdic premiums certain executive compensation and meals and entertainment expense 

key is currently assessing the overall impact of the tcj act on the future expected federal income tax obligations of both key and our clients we expect that key’s future federal income tax liabilities will overall benefit from the provisions in the tcj act however we also expect that certain aspects of our business may change over time both as to the investments we may make as a result of tax reform and in response to how the provisions in the tcj act may affect our customers and influence how we offer and deliver our products and services in the future 

refer to note 14 income taxes for information on the impact of the tcj act to our 2017 financial results 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara 

keycorp consummated its merger with first niagara on august 1 2016 the success of the merger including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend on among other things our ability to combine the businesses of keycorp and first niagara in a manner that permits growth opportunities including among other things enhanced revenues and revenue synergies an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of keycorp or first niagara nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation’s business financial condition operating results and prospects in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management and capital planning functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating incurred loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 



introduction 

this section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth when you read this discussion you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents 

terminology 

throughout this discussion references to “key” “we” “our” “us” and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries “keycorp” refers solely to the parent holding company and “keybank” refers solely to keycorp’s subsidiary bank keybank national association keybank consolidated refers to the consolidated entity consisting of keybank and its subsidiaries 

we want to explain some industryspecific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows 

 

the acronyms and abbreviations identified below are used in the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you may find it helpful to refer back to this page as you read this report 



figure 1 selected financial data     



  



figure 2  presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible 

common equity” “cash efficiency ratio” “preprovision net revenue” certain financial measures excluding notable items and “common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules” 

notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without mergerrelated charges andor other notable items including the impact of tax reform and related actions in order to enable a better understanding of our results increase comparability of periodtoperiod results and to evaluate and forecast those results 

as disclosed in note 2   business combination  and note 15  “ acquisitions divestiture and discontinued operations ” we completed the purchase of first niagara on august 1 2016 the definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire first niagara was originally announced on october 30 2015 as a result of this transaction we have recognized mergerrelated charges which are included in the total for “notable items” figure 2  shows the computation of “return on average tangible common equity excluding notable items” “preprovision net revenue excluding notable items” “cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items” and “return on average assets from continuing operations excluding notable items” 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some 

investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position 

without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may 

assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our 

capital adequacy on these same bases figure 2  reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding 

nongaap measures 

figure 2  also shows the computation for and reconciliation of preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly 

comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset 

amortization from the calculation we also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items we believe 

these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks 

additionally these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank 

analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not 

audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company 

they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses 

of results as reported under gaap

longterm financial targets 

figure 3  shows the evaluation of our longterm financial targets for the year ended december 31 2017  

figure 3 evaluation of our longterm targets 



  

 

as we have now reached our existing longterm goals in 2017 beginning in 2018 we have revised our longterm financial targets as follows 



corporate strategy 

we remain committed to enhancing longterm shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationshiporiented business model growing our franchise and being disciplined in our capital management our strategic focus is to deliver ease value and expertise to help our clients make better financial decisions and build enduring relationships we intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships effectively managing risk and rewards maintaining financial strength and engaging retaining and inspiring our diverse and highperforming workforce these strategic priorities for enhancing longterm shareholder value are described in more detail below 



generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers we will leverage our continuous improvement culture to maintain an efficient cost structure that is aligned sustainable and consistent with the current operating environment and that supports our relationship business model 



strategic developments 

we took the following actions during 2017  to support our corporate strategy 



results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “te basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the 2017 statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 4  shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

te net interest income for 2017 was 38 billion  and the net interest margin was 317  compared to te net interest income of 30 billion  and a net interest margin of 292  for the prior year 2017 reflects the full year benefit from the first niagara acquisition including purchase accounting accretion higher interest rates low deposit betas and growth in our core earning asset balances te net interest income for 2016 increased 577 million from 2015 and the net interest margin increase by 4 basis points reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields in 2018 we expect net interest income to be in the range of 39 billion to 40 billion with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in june 2018 

 

average loans totaled 864 billion  for 2017  compared to 711 billion  in 2016  this increase reflected the impact of the first niagara acquisition and growth in commercial and industrial loans for 2018  we anticipate average loans to be in the range of 885 billion to 895 billion 

average earning assets totaled 1208 billion  for 2017 compared to 1013 billion  in 2016 reflecting the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans at december 31   2017 the remaining fair value discount on the first niagara acquired loan portfolio was 266 million 

average deposits totaled 1029 billion  for 2017 an increase  of 166 billion  compared to 2017  primarily reflecting the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition in addition we realized core deposit growth in 2017 driven by the strength of our retail banking franchise and from commercial clients partly offset by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits for 2018  we anticipate average deposits to be in the range of 1045 billion to 1055 billion

figure 5  shows how the changes in yields or rates and average balances from the prior year affected net interest income the section entitled “financial condition” contains additional discussion about changes in earning assets and funding sources 

figure 5 components of net interest income changes from continuing operations   



 

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 229 million  for 2017  compared to 266 million  for 2016  the decrease  of 37 million  in our provision for credit losses is related to a decrease in our alll taken during 2017  on our commercial loan portfolio when compared to the year prior partially offset by a slight increase in our net loan chargeoffs over the past twelve months the commercial alll decreased due to a year over year reduction in loan outstandings as well as a decrease in classified and nonperforming loans for 2016  the increase  of 100 million  in our provision for credit losses was primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios increased chargeoffs and loan growth in 2018 we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan chargeoffs to provide for loan growth 

noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2017  was 25 billion  compared to 21 billion  during 2016  and 19 billion  during 2015  noninterest income represented 39  of total revenue for 2017  41  of total revenue for 2016  and 44  of total revenue for 2015  in 2018 we expect noninterest income to be in the range of 25 billion to 26 billion 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 6 noninterest income   

 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2017  trust and investment services income increased 71 million  or 153  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in insurance and brokerage commissions due to the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition and higher fees earned from investment management services as a result of stronger market performance for 2016  trust and investment services income increased 31 million or 72 from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher insurance and brokerage commissions 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2017  our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 396 billion  compared to 366 billion  at december 31 2016  and 340 billion  at december 31 2015  as shown in figure 7  the increase from 2016  to 2017  was primarily attributable to the market appreciation over the past twelve months the increase from 2015  to 2016  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara 

figure 7 assets under management   



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2017  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 121 million  or 251  from the prior year due to growth in financial advisory debt financing and mortgage banking fees from our core franchise as well as the acquisition of cain brothers in october 2017 for 2016  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 37 million or 83 from the prior year primarily driven by increased gains on the sale of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees partially offset by a decrease in syndication fees 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 54 million  or 232  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher volumes in atm debit card purchase and prepaid cards and merchant services cards and payments income increased 50 million or 273 in 2016  compared to 2015  due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts increased 55 million  or 18  in 2017  compared to the prior year primarily driven by the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition and investments in commercial payments service charges on deposit accounts increased 46 million or 18 in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara 

other noninterest income 

other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains corporate services income corporateowned life insurance income consumer mortgage income mortgage servicing fees net gains losses from principal investing and other income other noninterest income increased 106 million or 180 in 2017 compared to 2016 drivers include a full year impact of first niagara a onetime gain related to key’s merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 higher operating lease income originations and growth from investments in the residential mortgage business other noninterest income increased 27 million or 48 in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by the acquisition of first niagara gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and changes in various miscellaneous income categories 

noninterest expense 

noninterest expense for 2017  was 41 billion  compared to 38 billion  for 2016  and 28 billion  for 2015  we recognized 217 million  of mergerrelated charges in 2017  compared to 483 million of merger and pensionrelated charges in 2016  and 61 million of merger pension and efficiencyrelated charges in 2015  figure 8  gives 

a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  in 2018 we expect noninterest expense to be in the range of 385 billion to 395 billion 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

figure 8 noninterest expense   

 

 

figure 9 mergerrelated charges   



personnel 

as shown in figure 10  personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 200 million  or 96  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition and the cain brothers acquisition in october 2017 in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding driven by business performance improvements of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards 

personnel expense increased by 421 million or 255 from 2015  to 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding driven by business performance improvements of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards 

figure 10 personnel expense   



 net occupancy 

net occupancy expense increased 26 million  or 85  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition net occupancy expense increased 50 million or 196 in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara 

other noninterest expense 

other noninterest expense includes equipment operating lease expense marketing fdic assessment intangible asset amortization oreo expenses and other miscellaneous expense categories in total other noninterest expense increased 189 million or 213 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of first niagara growth was also driven by on  going investments and business acquisitions during 2017 including the build out of the residential mortgage platform and the acquisitions of hellowallet cain brothers and merchant services other noninterest expense increased 278 million or 456 in 2016 compared to 2015 drivers include the impact of the first niagara acquisition higher operating lease expenses cards and payments processing and changes in other miscellaneous expenses 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 637 million for 2017  compared to 179 million for 2016  and 303 million for 2015  the increase in tax provision from 2016 to 2017 was driven by the tcj act the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 330 for 2017  compared to 185 for 2016  and 248 for 2015  in 2018 we expect our gaap tax rate to be in the range of 18 to 19 

in 2017 our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects periodic adjustments to our tax reserves and the impact of the tcj act as described in note 14 income taxes 

in 2016 our effective tax rate was reduced due to lower pretax income resulting from mergerrelated charges increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards in 2015 our effective tax rate was reduced due to additional federal tax credit refunds 

line of business results 

this section summarizes the financial performance of our two major business segments operating segments key community bank and key corporate bank note 25  “ line of business results ” describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and certain lines of business and explains “other segments” and “reconciling items” 

figure 11  summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxableequivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income loss from continuing operations attributable to key” for each of the past three years 

figure 11 major business segments — taxableequivalent revenue from continuing operations and income loss from continuing operations attributable to key   

  



 

key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 12  key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 649 million  for 2017  compared to 365 million  for 2016  and 255 million  for 2015  the increase in 2017  was primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara as well as growth in key’s core businesses 

te net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase is primarily due to growth in both loan and deposit balances the balance increases are primarily due to a full year impact of the first niagara acquisition te net interest income also benefited from growth in core businesses higher interest rates and wellmanaged deposit betas 

noninterest income increased from 2016 the increase in 2017 was primarily due to a fullyear impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in key’s core businesses growth in key’s core businesses included higher trust and investment services income due to market growth of assets under management strength in cards and payments and higher deposit service charges driven by investments in commercial payments the increase in other income includes a onetime gain related to key’s merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 

the provision for credit losses increased from 2016 primarily related to loan growth in 2017 

noninterest expense increased from 2016 primarily related to a full year impact of first niagara in addition to the impact of first niagara personnel expense increases are primarily related to ongoing business investments and business acquisitions including hellowallet in the third quarter of 2017 nonpersonnel expense increased primarily due to ongoing business investments and business acquisitions including hellowallet and key’s merchant services acquisition in 2017 

in 2016 key community bank’s net income attributable to key increased from the prior year te net interest income increased from 2015 the positive contribution to net interest income is from loan and deposit growth related to the acquisition of first niagara and the increased value of deposits noninterest income increased from 2015 driven by the acquisition of first niagara and includes higher service charges on deposits higher cards and payments income due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card income and higher trust and investment services income driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions the provision for loan and lease losses increased from 2015 primarily related to the addition of acquired first niagara loan portfolios and loan growth noninterest expense increased from 2015 personnel expense increased primarily related to the addition of first niagara employees nonpersonnel expense increased primarily due to higher intangible amortization expense fdic assessment expense and other various expenses related to the acquisition of first niagara

as shown in figure 13  key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 814 million  for 2017  compared to 628 million  for 2016  and 544 million  for 2015  the 2017 increase was driven by an increase in revenue and lower provision for credit losses but slightly offset by higher noninterest expense 

te net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 this increase is primarily due to growth in both loan and deposit balances the balance increases are due to a full year impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in core businesses 

noninterest income increased from 2016 the majority of the increase is related to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees with growth in financial advisory debt capital markets and mortgage banking fees from our core key franchise as well as the fourth quarter acquisition of cain brothers operating lease income and other leasing gains increased due to higher originations cards and payments income increased due to higher volumes in purchase and prepaid card and merchant services slightly offsetting these increases is a decline in other noninterest income mostly driven by impairments and lower gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business  

the provision for credit losses decreased from 2016 primarily due to lower net loan chargeoffs and lower provisioning related to improving credit quality in the overall portfolio  

noninterest expense increased from 2016 personnel expense increased due to higher salaries incentive compensation benefits and stockbased compensation expense partially related to the acquisition of cain brothers as well as higher performancebased compensation nonpersonnel expense increased due to higher operating lease expense cards and payments processing and other various expenses related to the acquisition of cain brothers

figure 14 composition of loans     



  

 at december 31 2017  total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 864 billion  compared to 860 billion  at the end of 2016  for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 627 billion  at december 31 2017  an increase  of 824 million  or 13  compared to december 31 2016  

figure 15  provides our commercial loan portfolio by industry classification as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

figure 15 commercial loans by industry   

  

commercial and industrial    commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio representing 48  of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2017  and 46  at december 31 2016  this portfolio is approximately 83 variable rate and consists of loans originated in both key corporate and community bank to large corporate middle market and small business clients 

commercial and industrial loans totaled 419 billion  at december 31 2017  an increase  of 21 billion  compared to december 31 2016  driven by increases in the business products commercial real estate consumer services and transportation industries which combined accounted for approximately 28  of the total portfolio mix at december 31 2017  

commercial real estate loans  our commercial real estate lending business includes both mortgage and construction loans and is conducted through two primary sources our 15state banking franchise and keybank 

real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system approximately 70  of loans outstanding at december 31 2017 were generated by our keybank real estate capital line of business nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties represented 79  of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2017  construction loans which provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project represented 12  of commercial real estate loans at year end  

at december 31 2017  commercial real estate loans totaled  160 billion  comprised of 141 billion  of mortgage loans and 19 billion  of construction loans compared to december 31 2016  this portfolio decreased   14 billion  largely the result of reductions in commercial mortgages which declined 10 billion reflecting significantly higher debt placements and paydowns in 2017 we continue to focus primarily on owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate in accordance with our relationship strategy 

as shown in figure 16  our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic locations of the underlying collateral these loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as a result of the first niagara acquisition we have an increased concentration of commercial real estate loans in the northeast region 

figure 16 commercial real estate loans   



loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial and consumer loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a casebycase basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or other income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr if commercial loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any loan determined to be a tdr during 2017  we had 89 million  of new tdr commercial loans compared to 37 million  of new tdr commercial loans in 2016  consumer loans modifications are handled centrally by our default management team in addition to consumer modifications that result in a credit concession we also classify consumer loans discharged in bankruptcy as a tdr during 2017  we had 41 million  of new tdr consumer loans compared to 34 million  of new tdr consumer loans in 2016  

for more information on concession types for our commercial and consumer accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 6  “ asset quality ” 

figure 17 tdrs by accrual status     



restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current welldocumented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we consider the borrower’s ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a tdr loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our tdr loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 6  “ asset quality ” 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but they are often modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for the client the repayment source and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal pay down increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity the strength of the guarantor if any and the structure and residual risk of the transaction therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the highlevel objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and nearterm debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

mortgage and construction loans with a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 may be accounted for as performing loans these loans may not be considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support as of december 31 2017  we did not have any mortgage and construction loans that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding at december 31 2017  totaled 237 billion  a decrease  of 457 million  or 19  from one year ago the decrease in consumer loans was driven by continued declines in the home equity loan portfolio largely the result of paydowns in home equity lines of credit partly offset by growth in indirect auto lending 

home equity loans are the largest component of our consumer loan portfolio representing approximately 51  of consumer loans outstanding at year end approximately 99 of this portfolio at december 31 2017  was originated by our key community bank within our 15state footprint 

as shown in figure 12  we held the first lien position for approximately 60  of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2017  and 57  at december 31 2016  for loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratios this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

loan sales 

as shown in figure 18  which summarizes our loan sales for 2017  and 2016  during 2017  we sold 120 billion  of our loans commercial real estate loan sales in 2017 increased 33 billion from 2016 due to organic growth and increased collaboration within our lines of business most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio however 183 million  of these loan sales related to the heldtomaturity portfolio in 2017  

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are 



 figure 18 loans sold including loans held for sale     



figure 19  shows loans that are either administered or serviced by us but not recorded on the balance sheet the table includes loans that have been sold 

figure 19 loans administered or serviced     



  

in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 33 billion  of the 2456 billion  of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2017  additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 22  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “mortgage servicing fees” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 10  “ mortgage servicing assets ” 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

figure 20  shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2017  approximately 31 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year

figure 21 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 



 

securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

wholesale funds consisting of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt averaged 136 billion  during 2017  compared to 111 billion  during 2016  the increase from the prior year reflects the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition and an increase in longterm debt issuances

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 13  “ variable interest entities ” 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2017  is presented in note 22  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 28  shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the board’s audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal requirements independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions including internal audit as well as financial reporting legal matters and fraud risk the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee annually the board reviews and approves the erm policy as well as the risk appetite including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument 

we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement these positions are subject to various marketbased risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 7  “ fair value measurements ” in this report our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings are nontrading positions these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions primarily changes in interest rates 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at year end we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy   the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm as the second line of defense is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether 

the position is in a trading account key’s covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at year end covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was 7 million at december 31 2017  and 19 million at december 31 2016  the decrease in aggregate var was primarily due to the lower inventories and the composition of our fixed income portfolio additionally starting with the 

third quarter of 2017 the aggregate var does not include the var for the credit derivatives that represented the hedging activities for the commercial real estate warehouse portfolio these activities are no longer considered as covered portfolio figure 29  summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  during this period none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits 

figure 29 var for significant portfolios of covered positions   



stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99 confidence level and applying certain assumptions the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 45 million at december 31 2017  and 41 million at december 31 2016  figure 30  summarizes our stressed var at the 99 confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

figure 30 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions   



internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was 445 million at december 31 2017  this amount included 353 million or mortgagebacked securities positions and 92 million of assetbacked securities positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

net interest income simulation analysis   the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the results of simulation analysis reflect managements desired interest rate risk positioning the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points but due to the low interest rate environment we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual parallel decrease of 125 basis points over eight months with no change over the following four months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the net interest income generated in an unchanged interest rate environment 

figure 31  presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  at december 31 2017  our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderately assetsensitive in 2017 the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 125 basis points tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 125 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 55 as a result of the federal reserve’s 2017 interest rate increases our modeled exposure to declining rates increased 

figure 31 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 31  net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by 1 billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by 1 billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 30 basis points if the interest bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5 eg 40 to 45 then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 90 basis points 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling   eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 125 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2017  

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 32  shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” 

interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 9  “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

figure 32 portfolio swaps by interest rate risk management strategy 





liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2017  are shown in figure 33  we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 33 credit ratings   



managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2017  totaled 272 billion consisting of 228 billion of unpledged securities 290 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 41 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2017  our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 238 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 63 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2017 key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances increased by 980 million due to additional borrowings 

final us liquidity coverage ratio 

under the liquidity coverage rules we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key at december 31 2017  our estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

additional information about the liquidity coverage rules and modified lcr is included in the “supervision and regulation” section under the heading “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” in item 1 of this report 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2017  our loantodeposit ratio was 844  which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 20  “ longterm debt ” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on june 9 2017 keybank issued 600 million of 240 senior bank notes due june 9 2022 under its global bank note program 

on september 14 2017 keybank issued 750 million of 230 senior bank notes due september 14 2022 under its global bank note program 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2017  keycorp held 23 billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2017  keybank paid 750 million  in dividends to keycorp at january 1 2018 keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 925 million  in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 174 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2017  as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 2 million in taxes to be paid we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2017  

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities add financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends for approval significant credit policies to the appropriate board or board committee these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 22 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2017  we had 14 client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these 14 individual net obligor commitments was 82 million at december 31 2017  in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion 

of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2017  we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 159 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 34  the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 34 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations   



 allowance for loan and lease losses 

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets the alll at december 31 2017  represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date for more information about impaired loans see note 6  “ asset quality ” 

as shown in figure 35  our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable increasing  by 19 million  or 22  from december 31 2016  our commercial alll increased  by 19 million  or 27  from december 31 2016  primarily because of loan   growth and credit quality moving toward normalized levels our consumer alll was unchanged  from december 31 2016  the consumer alll was impacted by declining loan balances and improving credit quality

net loan chargeoffs 

figure 36  shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 37  

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased   3 million  this increase  is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher chargeoffs in our consumer loan portfolios partially offset by an increase in recoveries in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio driven by a large recovery during the third quarter of 2017 in 2018 we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points

 nonperforming assets 

figure 38  shows the composition of our nonperforming assets as shown in figure 38  nonperforming assets decreased   142 million  during 2017  most of the decrease  came from our commercial and industrial loan portfolio centered in oil and gas exposures these improvements were slightly offset by increases in nonperforming designations in our consumer portfolio as a result of regulatory guidance see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the headings “nonperforming loans” “impaired loans” and “allowance for loan and lease losses” for a summary of our nonaccrual and chargeoff policies

figure 39 summary of changes in nonperforming loans from continuing operations   





operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses 

andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes in order to protect our customers whose information may have been exposed through the recent breach of the equifax credit bureau or other external security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 181 million  or 17  per common share compared to 213 million  or 20  per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016  

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017  was 57  compared to 69  for the fourth quarter of 2016  the annualized return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations was 635  for the fourth quarter of 2017  compared to 788  for the yearago quarter

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 656 million  for the fourth  quarter of 2017  compared to 618 million  for the yearago quarter growth was largely driven by another record quarter of investment banking and debt placement fees up 43 million from the yearago period related to the recent acquisition of cain brothers as well as ongoing growth in our core franchise including strength in commercial mortgage banking momentum continued in many feebased businesses as cards and payments income and trust and investment services income each grew 8 million from the yearago period as a result of higher credit card and merchant fees and strength in the equity markets respectively these increases were partially offset by a decline in other income including 7 million of impairments of certain taxadvantaged assets which were offset by a reduction of related income tax expense 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 11 billion  for the fourth quarter of 2017  compared to 12 billion  for the fourth quarter of 2016  and included a number of notable items including mergerrelated charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions mergerrelated charges included 26 million of personnel expense and 30 million of nonpersonnel expense mostly reflected in net occupancy marketing and other expense the fourth quarter of 2017 was the last quarter that merger charges related to the first niagara acquisition will be reported the estimated impact of tax reform and other related actions totaled 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 including the impairment of certain taxadvantaged assets as well as a onetime additional contribution to employee retirement accounts 

excluding notable items noninterest expense was unchanged from the yearago period expenses related to acquisitions and investments including cain brothers as well as higher operating lease expense were offset by the realization of first niagara cost savings

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth  quarter of 2017  totaled 52 million  or 24  of average total loans these results compare to 72 million  or 34  for the fourth  quarter of 2016  

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2017  we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 251 million compared to a tax provision of 38 million for the fourth quarter of 2016  the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017  was 562 compared to 141 for the same quarter one year ago due to lower pretax income resulting from mergerrelated charges increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards and the tcj act our income tax provision increased 147 million or 33 compared to the same quarter one year ago due to the reduction to our net deferred tax asset and related actions associated with the tcj act accordingly our tax provision from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the tcj act was 104 million and our effective tax rate was 232 for the quarter refer to note 14  “ income taxes ” for more information on the impact of the tcj act

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the alll is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio in determining the alll we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards concentrations of credit collateral values and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan 

our loss estimates include an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflective in the historical loss riskrating or other indicative data the alll is sensitive to a variety of internal factors such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings the alll is also sensitive to a variety of external factors such as the general health of the economy as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices changes in real estate demand and values interest rates unemployment rates bankruptcy filings fluctuations in the gdp and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts 

since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate alll because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2017  would indicate the need for a 24 million  increase in the alll the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 63 million  increase in the alll such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 24 million  increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 15 million  or 01  per common share a 63 million  increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 39 million  or 04  per common share 

our accounting policy related to the alll is disclosed in note 1  under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

fair value measurements 

we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to “normal” market activity management’s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 

a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs that we utilize fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level 1 valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level 2 valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based 

techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level 3 valuations these unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 

the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs 

and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there 

is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not 

be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use 

in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are 

regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 

changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value 

fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of 

accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including htm 

securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance 

impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an 

impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair 

value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions 

previously discussed 

see note 1  under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 7  “ fair value measurements ” for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes 

goodwill 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1  under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2017  therefore the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of the analysis are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 

the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on riskbased regulatory capital requirements fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions a multiyear internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry earnings projections for both reporting units are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capital asset pricing model “capm” the buildup to the discount rate includes a riskfree rate 5year adjusted beta based on peer companies a market equity risk premium a size premium and a company specific risk premium the discount rates differ between our two reporting segments as they have different levels of risk  key corporate bank generally has a higher discount rate due to a higher level of perceived risk related to its service offerings and asset mix a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill impairment may be indicated in such a case we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing and we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value then we would compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill the impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to earnings we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note 12  “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices on january 1 2018 we will early adopt revised derivative and hedging accounting guidance for additional information on the adoption of this guidance refer to the table in note 1  under the heading “accounting guidance pending adoption on december 31 2017” additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1  under the heading “derivatives” and note 9  “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 22  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 22  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2017  

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 14  “ income taxes ” 

during 2017  we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval by the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company “fhc” for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that they are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others 

under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

as an fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2016 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital requirements 

background 

keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision “basel committee” the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and promote financial stability 

the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk “riskweighted assets” each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier 1 capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures 

a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 1 while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier 2 a banking organization’s total capital equals the sum of its tier 1 and tier 2 capital 

the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organization’s total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity 

basel iii 

to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the 20072009 global financial crisis in 2010 the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as “basel iii” the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a tier 1 common equity capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis 

in july 2013 the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january 1 2015 and a multiyear transition period ending on december 31 2018 “regulatory capital rules” consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier 1 and tier 2 capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum tier 1 common equity capital ratio requirement of 45 and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over 250 billion in total consolidated assets or 10 billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as “standardized approach banking organizations” 

under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations like keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2016 key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 943  under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules also at december 31 2016 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk would be as set forth in the following table 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 



  

 revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios 

federal prompt corrective action regulations under the fdia group fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action rules table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the regulatory capital rules 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action rules 

  



  

 we believe that as of december 31 2016  keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp 

liquidity requirements 

keycorp is subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in 2010 and subsequently revised between 2013 and 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs 

to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” calculated as the ratio of a banking organization’s highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding banking organizations must satisfy minimum basel iii lcr and nsfr requirements of at least 100 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules establish a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules unless the occ affirmatively determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of keybank’s asset size level of complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system 

under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp must calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and is required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of 100 by january 1 2017 at december 31 2016 key’s estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future keycorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

in december 2016 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp must publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr that discussion may include the main drivers of the modified lcr changes in the modified lcr over time and the causes of such changes the composition of eligible highquality liquid assets concentration of funding sources derivative exposures and potential capital calls any currency mismatch and the centralized liquidity management function of the organization and its interaction with other functional areas keycorp must comply with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning april 1 2018 and subsequent quarters 

the federal banking agencies commenced implementation of the basel iii nsfr in the united states in april and may 2016 with the release of a proposed rule to implement a minimum net stable funding ratio “nsfr” requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations excluding keycorp and a modified version of the minimum nsfr requirement “modified nsfr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp together with quarterly public disclosure requirements the proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum nsfr requirement of 10 on an ongoing basis however banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr like keycorp would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding equal to 70 of the required stable funding under the nsfr the proposed rule would be effective on january 1 2018 the comment period for the npr expired on august 5 2016 if the proposed nsfr requirement is adopted as a final rule then similar to actions taken in connection with the implementation of the liquidity coverage rules keycorp may adjust its balance sheet or modify product offerings to enhance its liquidity position 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorp’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large noncomplex bhc as set forth in a federal reserve guidance document issued on december 18 2015 “sr letter 1519” under sr letter 1519 the federal reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding 

governance risk management internal controls capital policy capital positions incorporating stressful conditions and events and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules sr letter 1519 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm’s capital planning processes 

the federal reserve’s annual ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation 

as part of the annual ccar the federal reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined annually by the federal reserve keycorp filed its 2016 ccar capital plan on april 5 2016 the 2016 ccar results which included the annual supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating covered companies including keycorp were publicly released by the federal reserve on june 23 2016 on june 29 2016 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016 capital plan 

keycorp and keybank must also conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank must only conduct an annual stress test keycorp must conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and occ keycorp is required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve keycorp and keybank published the results of their companyrun annual stress test on june 23 2016 keycorp published the results of its companyrun midcycle stress test on november 2 2016 summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests are disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosures and filings” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

on january 30 2017 the federal reserve released a final rule to revise the capital plan and stress test rules as they apply to large noncomplex bhcs and us intermediaries of foreign banks under the final rule a large noncomplex bhc is one with total consolidated assets of more than 50 billion but less than 250 billion and nonbank assets of less than 75 billion “covered bhcs” this includes keycorp 

the final rule provides relief from the compliance requirements associated with the federal reserve’s capital plan and stress test rules specifically the final rule relieves covered bhcs from the qualitative assessment portion of the federal reserve’s ccar program and modifies the reporting requirements for these organizations by reducing the reporting requirements applicable to covered bhcs under the fr y14a and raising the materiality thresholds for specific portfolio reporting requirements going forward the federal reserve will review the capital plans of covered bhcs in a manner similar to existing supervisory programs which typically include the distribution of a first day letter in advance of the start date of the review standard communication during the exam lead time to meet requests for additional information and sufficient time frames to address the findings of the review 

the final rule also limits the amount of capital a covered bhc is authorized to distribute in excess of the amount set forth in its capital plan without federal reserve approval the “de minimis exception” and establishes a onequarter blackout period during which a bhc is not permitted to submit a notice to use the de minimis exception or seek prior approval to make a capital distribution in an amount that exceeds the de minimis exception level if exigent circumstances arise during the blackout period that require a capital distribution a covered bhc may resubmit its capital plan and request expedited review from the federal reserve however the federal reserve is not required to expedite the review process 

the final rule also requires covered bhcs to measure nonbank assets on a monthly basis and report the average throughout the quarter to the federal reserve on a quarterly basis beginning march 31 2017 

the final rule is effective 30 days after publication in the federal register and therefore the relief provided under the final rule from the qualitative assessment portion of the ccar program is effective for the 2017 ccar cycle 

dividend restrictions 

federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than “adequately capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 4  “ restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities ” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

as required under the doddfrank act in march 2015 the fdic approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least 10 billion like keybank the surcharge is 45 cents per 100 of the institution’s assessment base after making certain adjustments the final rule became effective on july 1 2016 as of july 1 2016 keybank must pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 135 surcharges will continue through the quarter that the dif reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 135 but not later than december 31 2018 if the reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 provided it is at least 115 the fdic will impose a shortfall assessment on march 31 2019 on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more like keybank 

in december 2016 the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the keybank ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule is effective on april 1 2017 with a mandatory compliance date of april 1 2020 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the 

contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind up a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution and recovery plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually by december 31 of each year for 2015 these resolution plans the third required from keycorp and keybank were submitted on december 1 2015 keycorp and keybank were not required to submit resolution plans for 2016 because the fdic and federal reserve deferred such requirement for 38 firms including keycorp and keybank until december 2017 annually in january the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans in the prior december the public section of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

on september 28 2016 the occ released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large occregulated institutions including keybank the guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable going concern during a period of severe financial stress under the final guidelines an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events escalation procedures recovery options and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors the recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity scope of operations and risk profile of the institution assuming that keybank has average total consolidated assets of greater than 100 billion but less than 750 billion as of january 1 2017 it must be in compliance with the guidelines not later than january 1 2018 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

volcker rule 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act which prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the volcker rule 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 the federal reserve has exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 with respect to covered funds in addition on december 12 2016 the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may 1 2010 to make an investment in “illiquid” covered funds 

key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading “other investments” in item 7 of this report on january 13 2017 key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect 

investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature or july 21 2022 the application for an extension was approved on february 14 2017 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the resolution plan requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 that same year the federal reserve issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in 2012 it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits monitoring liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management including the requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

in march 2016 the federal reserve issued an npr proposing to establish a minimum sccl for bhcs with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more like keycorp this proposal would implement a provision in the doddfrank act and replaces proposals on this subject issued by the federal reserve in 2011 and 2012 under the proposal a covered bhc including keycorp would not be allowed to have an aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25 of the consolidated capital stock and surplus of the covered bhc global systemicallyimportant banks and certain other large bhcs excluding keycorp would be subject to stricter limits under the proposal a covered bhc such as keycorp would be required to comply with the proposed limits and quarterly reporting to show such compliance starting two years after the effective date of a final rule the comment period for the npr expired on june 3 2016 keycorp does not expect to be materially impacted by this proposal if it is adopted as a final rule the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in 2011 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm certain of the victory mutual funds with which we continue to have a relationship and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in 

accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

erisa fiduciary standard 

in april 2016 the department of labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under erisa for making investment advice recommendations to i certain retirement plan fiduciaries participants or beneficiaries and ii owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts among other retirement plans the purpose of these rules is to place fiduciary obligations rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply on these service providers accordingly the rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations under erisa such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer the requirement of impartial conduct is effective april 10 2017 and the contract provisions must be in place by january 1 2018 




 item 1a risk   factors   

as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover the debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs outpace the estimate in our current methodology used to establish our alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrain and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 72  of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile that includes among other risks a borrower’s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and supervision 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

keybank has faced scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly due to keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts continue to be implemented as well as other significant regulations which have been enacted with upcoming effective dates as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act and other significant regulations 

changes to existing statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

as a financial institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision as a result of the merger with first niagara we acquired certain lines of business that offer additional consumer products including auto finance and insurance products in addition the first niagara acquisition allowed us to expand our residential mortgage business with our increased size and expanded lines of business we are subject to additional heightened requirements and expectations the amount of regulation and supervision to which we are subject and our cost of compliance have increased with the additional consumer products that we now offer we like other companies who provide similar consumer products face the risk of class actions and other litigation and claims arising out of these products 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources 

including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and high quality liquid assets than has historically been the case 

evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the new capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s capital standards will require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders capital securities usually are the most expensive form of funding and increasing capital levels could adversely impact key’s profitability 

in addition the new liquidity standards required us to increase our holdings of higherquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost of funds than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital requirements” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment in light of recent moderate improvements in the us economy federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields which could have an unfavorable effect on the quantity and cost of borrowed funds in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in 

addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the doddfrank act we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings following key’s announced acquisition of first niagara in october 2015 sp and fitch affirmed key’s ratings but changed the outlook to negative on july 13 2016 moody’s subsequently confirmed key’s ratings and changed the outlook from negative to stable concluding their review a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 



 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “risk management — management of interest risk exposure” found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england — and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and continued improvement in the overall us economy may not result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the real estate and healthcare market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

tax reform may impact our tax liabilities the tax liabilities of our clients and how we do business 

following the us general election a number of new tax reform ideas have been proposed tax reform and other changes in tax laws may cause an increase or decrease in our overall income tax liabilities changes in tax laws generally will impact our clients in different ways and magnitudes and could also impact how we deliver products to our clients and satisfy our community reinvestment obligations 

current tax reform proposals include reducing the statutory federal income tax rate which generally would reduce our tax expense as well as the tax expense of our clients however such a reduction would in general negatively impact the economic value of taxexempt investments including corporateowned life insurance and municipal securities and also impact certain tax leasing transactions other potential changes such as the loss of certain tax deductions and credits could have an adverse impact on our overall income tax obligation and on our clients which could change how we conduct our business operations in the future 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms 

increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities such as the first niagara merger that we consummated on august 1 2016 may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara 

keycorp consummated its merger with first niagara on august 1 2016 the success of the merger including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend on among other things our ability to combine the businesses of keycorp and first niagara in a manner that permits growth opportunities including among other things enhanced revenues and revenue synergies an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of keycorp or first niagara nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation’s business financial condition operating results and prospects in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 

we will continue to incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the first niagara merger 

we incurred and expect to continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with consummating the first niagara merger in addition we will continue to incur integration costs as we integrate our business and first niagara’s business including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time we may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management and capital planning functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating incurred loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

economic overview 

the us economy continued its modest recovery in 2016 with preliminary overall real gdp growth of 16 this was slower than the growth in 2015 of 26 due to a weaker start to the year with tepid growth of 8 in the first quarter and 14 in the second quarter before accelerating in the third and fourth quarters slower growth in emerging markets weak investment spending and sluggish demand for american exports caused by a strong us dollar all factored in to muted economic expansion this year 

globally the economic recovery also slowed the european central bank extended their quantitative easing program for another year in an effort to combat deflation while emerging markets struggled in the face of low commodity prices and a cooling chinese economy 

oil prices saw a material increase of 460 over the year as supply levels normalized after plummeting to multiyear lows in 2014 and 2015 while this led to slightly higher fuel prices it also gave muchneeded support to america’s struggling energy industry the stock market also performed admirably in 2016 with the sp 500 equity index up 95 compared to a 7 decrease in 2015 much of the rally occurred late in the year following the election and based on expectations for growthfriendly economic policies from the us presidential administration 

for 2016 22 million new jobs were added in the us the unemployment rate fell from 50 on december 31 2015 to 47 on december 31 2016 while weak labor force participation was a factor solid job gains also drove the decline slack appears to be leaving the labor market as reflected in rising wage growth up 29 in december 2016 over last year consumers preferred to spend rather than save in 2016 as personal consumption was up 38 while the savings rate fell from 61 to 54 over this same time frame headline inflation moved upward by 21 in 2016 surpassing the fed’s target of 20 after falling short in 2015 at 7 core inflation was also healthy throughout the year ending 2016 at 22 compared to 21 at the end of 2015 

as a result of the solid economy and strengthening labor market the housing market generally benefited in 2016 new home sales growth outpaced existing home sales with sales of new singlefamily houses totaling 562000 in 2016 up 122 compared to 2015 price appreciation slowed somewhat but remained positive with the median price for existing homes up 38 yearoveryear in december 2016 compared to 75 in december 2015 housing starts also posted respectable gains up 57 from december 2015 supported by multifamily construction of 91 while singlefamily construction lagged slightly at 39 however a declining home ownership rate continues to weigh on sales growth existing home sales finished 2016 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549 million roughly unchanged from december 2015 

after hinting at multiple rate hikes going into 2016 the federal open market committee “fomc” approved its first and only rate hike of the year at its december 14 2016 meeting raising interest rates by 25 basis points to the range of 50  75 the fomc cited an improving labor market and inflation levels which have reached the fed’s 20 target as the rationale behind their first rate hike since last december the 10year us treasury yield began the year at 22 and dipped to as low as 14 over the summer driven by temporarily disappointing labor market data it then recovered to 25 in the final weeks of 2016 as capital rotated from treasuries into equities following the election and expectations for additional fed rate hikes 

longterm financial targets 

our longterm financial targets are as follows

we initiated the following actions during 2016  to support our corporate strategy 



noninterest expense increased from prior year this increase primarily reflects the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher incentive and stockbased compensation 



  highlights of our   2016   performance 

financial performance 

for 2016  we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 753 million  or 80  per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 892 million  or 105  per common share for 2015  

figure 3  shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years 

figure 3 results of operations   



  



our 2017 expectations as discussed below do not include the effect of mergerrelated charges 

our 2016  fullyear results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management 

our taxableequivalent net interest income for 2016  was 2953 billion  and the net interest margin was 292  these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2376 billion  and a net interest margin of 288  for the prior year reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields in 2017  we expect net interest income to be in the range of 36 billion to 37 billion with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in the middle of 2017 

our noninterest income was 21 billion  up 191 million  or 102  from 2015  growth was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core feebased businesses reflecting investments we have made over the past few years including the acquisition of first niagara in the third quarter of 2016 investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and reached a record level increasing 37 million from 2015  cards and payments income along with corporate services income also had a record year increasing 273 and 86 respectively from 2015 in 2017  we expect noninterest income to be in the range of 23 billion to 24 billion 

our noninterest expense was 38 billion  an increase of 916 million  or 323  from 2015  we recognized 483 million of merger and pensionrelated charges in 2016  compared to 61 million of merger efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2015  excluding these charges noninterest expense increased 494 million or 178 from 2015  personnel expense increased 421 million  driven primarily by the acquisition of first niagara in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding of both cash based plans and performance based stock awards nonpersonnel expense increased 495 million primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara in 2017  we expect noninterest expense to be in the range of 365 billion to 375 billion 

average loans totaled 711 billion  for 2016  compared to 586 billion  in 2015  this increase reflected the impact of the first niagara acquisition and growth in commercial financial and agricultural loans for 2017  we anticipate average loan growth in the midsingledigit 4 to 6 range with 2016 adjusted to account for a full year impact of first niagara 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 864 billion for 2016 an increase of 162 billion compared to 2015 primarily reflecting the acquisition of first niagara and higher interestbearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 852 at december 31 2016  compared to 878 at december 31 2015  for 2017  we anticipate average deposit growth in the midsingledigit 4 to 6 range with 2016 adjusted to account for a full year impact of first niagara 

we maintained credit discipline in 2016  and our asset quality ratios remained strong the provision for credit losses was 266 million  for 2016  compared to 166 million  for 2015  over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased 63 million this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher chargeoffs in our commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio over the same period net loan chargeoffs were 205 million  or 29  of average loan balances for 2016  compared to 142 million  or 24  for 2015  our nonperforming loans increased to 625 million  or 73  of periodend loans at december 31 2016  compared to 387 million  or 65  at december 31 2015  our alll was 858 million  or 100  of periodend loans compared to 796 million  or 133  at december 31 2015  and represented 137  and 206  coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively in 2017 we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and for the provision to slightly exceed net loan chargeoffs to provide for loan growth 

our capital ratios remain strong our tangible common equity and tier 1 riskbased capital ratios were 809  and 1089  respectively at december 31 2016  compared to 998  and 1135  respectively at december 31 2015  in addition our common equity tier 1 was 954  and 1094  respectively at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  we have identified four primary uses of capital 



 

capital management remains a clear priority for us during 2016  our fullyear dividend per common share increased 14 from the prior year and we repurchased 133 million of common shares 

figure 4  presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible common equity” “common equity tier 1” “tier 1 common equity” “preprovision net revenue” “cash efficiency ratio” certain financial measures excluding mergerrelated charges and “common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules estimates” 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as common equity tier 1 because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on common equity tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories the regulatory capital rules described in more detail under the section “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report also make common equity tier 1 a priority the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by among other changes phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital starting in 2016 our trust preferred securities are only included in tier 2 capital since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and common equity tier 1 we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4  also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

figure 4  also shows the computation for and reconciliation of preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

as disclosed in note 2   business combination  and note 14  “ acquisition divestiture and discontinued operations ” keycorp completed its purchase of first niagara on august 1 2016 the definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire first niagara was originally announced on october 30 2015 as a result of this transaction we have recognized mergerrelated charges figure 4  shows the computation of preprovision net revenue excluding mergerrelated charges noninterest expense excluding mergerrelated charges eps excluding mergerrelated charges and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding mergerrelated charges we believe that eliminating the effects of the mergerrelated charges makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis with our prior results 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation we also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding mergerrelated charges we believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 5  shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

net interest income and the net interest margin for 2016 reflect contributions from the acquisition of first niagara on august 1 2016 111 million of related purchase accounting accretion and 6 million of onetime mergerrelated charges 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2016 was 2953 billion and the net interest margin was 292 compared to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2376 billion and a net interest margin of 288 for the prior year reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2015 increased 59 million compared to 2014 and the net interest margin declined 9 basis points the increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields which also drove the decline in the net interest margin 

average earning assets totaled 1013 billion for 2016 compared to 825 billion in 2015 reflecting the impact of the first niagara acquisition growth in commercial financial and agricultural loans and higher levels of liquidity driven by deposit growth and longterm debt issuances 

the acquisition of first niagara contributed approximately 23 billion of periodend loans and 9 billion in investment securities as part of the acquisition we divested 439 million of loans and exited approximately 330 million of acquired nonrelationship commercial loans in addition we completed the planned sales and repositioning of first niagara’s investment portfolio to more closely align with our portfolio and investment philosophy 

the acquisition resulted in an estimated adjustment to the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio of 548 million we anticipate finalizing the valuation of the acquired loans during the first quarter of 2017 depending on when the valuation is finalized within the first quarter we may not be able to adjust the value of the acquired loans if deemed necessary until the second quarter of 2017 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 864 billion for 2016 an increase of 162 billion compared to 2015 primarily reflecting the acquisition of first niagara and higher interestbearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business 

the acquisition of first niagara contributed approximately 273 billion of periodend deposits at september 30 2016 this amount excludes 16 billion of deposits that were divested in the third quarter of 2016 the acquired deposits are spread across deposit products and consist primarily of consumer deposits

noninterest income 

as shown in figure 7  noninterest income for 2016  was 21 billion  up 191 million  or 102  from 2015  growth was driven by continued momentum in a number of our core feebased businesses reflecting investments we have made over the past few years as well as the first niagara acquisition investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and reached a record level increasing 37 million from 2015  cards and payments income and corporate services income also had a record year increasing 273 and 86 respectively from 2015 

in 2015  noninterest income increased 83 million or 46 compared to 2014  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 48 million from 2014  trust and investment services income increased 30 million primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of 20 million in corporate services income due to higher nonyield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income and 17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume other income also increased 10 million these increases were partially offset by declines of 27 million in net gains from principal investing and 23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains 

figure 7 noninterest income   



  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income for 2016  trust and investment services income increased 31 million  or 72  from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher insurance and brokerage commissions for 2015  trust and investment services income increased 30 million or 74 from the prior year primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown below in figure 8  at december 31 2016  our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 366 billion  compared to 34 billion  at december 31 2015  and 392 billion  at december 31 2014  as shown in figure 8  the increase from 2015  to 2016  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara the decrease from 2014  to 2015  was primarily attributable to client attrition in the securities lending portfolio and market declines across all the portfolios 

figure 8 assets under management   



investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2016  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 37 million  or 83  from the prior year for 2015  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 48 million or 121 from the prior year these increases were primarily driven by increased gains on the sale of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees partially offset by a decrease in syndication fees 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts increased 46 million  or 18  in 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara service charges on deposit accounts decreased 5 million or 19 in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower overdraft charges resulting from changes in posting order 

corporate services income 

corporate services income increased 17 million  or 86  in 2016  compared to 2015  driven by higher dealer trading and derivatives income corporate services income increased 20 million or 112 in 2015  compared to 2014  driven by higher nonyield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 50 million  or 273  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume cards and payments income increased 17 million or 102 in 2015  compared to 2014  due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume 

other income 

other income which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale other service charges and certain dealer trading income increased 40 million  or 741  in 2016  compared to 2015  reflecting the impact of the first niagara acquisition and changes in various miscellaneous income categories other income increased 10 million or 227 in 2015  compared to 2014  due to changes in various miscellaneous income categories

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 10  noninterest expense for 2016  was 38 billion  an increase of 916 million  or 323  from 2015  we recognized 483 million of merger and pensionrelated charges in 2016  compared to 61 million of merger efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2015  excluding these charges noninterest expense increased 494 million or 178 from 2015  as shown in figure 12  personnel expense increased 421 million  driven primarily by the acquisition of first niagara in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards nonpersonnel expense increased 495 million primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara 

noninterest expense for 2015 was 28 billion an increase of 79 million or 29 from 2014 we recognized 61 million of merger efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2015 compared to 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 

2014 personnel expense increased 61 million driven by higher incentive and stockbased compensation employee benefits and salaries partially offset by lower technology contract labor and severance nonpersonnel expense increased 18 million primarily due to increases in marketing of 8 million and computer processing of 6 million

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 12  personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 421 million  or 255  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara in addition there was higher incentive and stockbased compensation due to higher funding of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards 

personnel expense increased by 61 million or 38 from 2014  to 2015  increases in incentive and stockbased compensation of 30 million employee benefits of 26 million and salaries of 21 million all contributed to the increase in personnel expense these increases were partially offset by declines in technology contract labor of 10 million and severance of 6 million

net occupancy expense increased 50 million  or 196  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara net occupancy expense decreased 6 million or 23 in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower charges related to vacating leased property and a decrease in rental expenses 

other expense 

other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment costs associated with technology service providers and franchise and business taxes other expense increased 161 million  or 468  in 2016  compared to 2015  reflecting the impact of the first niagara acquisition certain real estate investments and other miscellaneous expenses other expense increased 10 million or 30 in 2015  compared to 2014  due to fluctuations in several of other expense line items 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 179 million for 2016  compared to 303 million for 2015  and 326 million for 2014  the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 185 for 2016  compared to 248 for 2015  and 256 for 2014  

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance tax credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and energy related projects and periodic adjustments to our tax reserves in 2016 our effective tax rate was reduced due to lower pretax income resulting from mergerrelated charges increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards in 2015 our effective tax rate was reduced by additional federal tax credit refunds and in 2014 due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains

key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14  key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 373 million  for 2016  compared to 264 million  for 2015  and 249 million  for 2014  the increase in 2016  was primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara as well as growth in key’s core businesses 

taxableequivalent net interest income increased 460 million  or 309  from 2015  average loans and leases grew 68 billion  while average deposits increased 127 billion  compared to 2015  the positive contribution to net interest income is from loan and deposit growth related to the acquisition of first niagara and the increased value of deposits 

noninterest income increased 137 million  or 174  from 2015  service charges on deposit accounts income increased 38 million or 178 cards and payments income increased 35 million or 208 due to higher credit card purchase card and atm debit card income trust and investment services income increased 24 million  or 81  driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions corporate services income increased 10 million or 21 consumer mortgage income was up 5 million or 417 investment banking and debt placement fees are up 3 million or 354 other noninterest income and operating lease income increases contributed the remaining growth of 22 million 

the provision for credit losses increased 77 million  or 110  from 2015  primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios which were acquired at a premium increase in the alll for loans that were individually evaluated for impairment and loan growth 

noninterest expense increased 346 million  or 194  from 2015  personnel expense increased 119 million primarily due to increases in salaries incentive compensation and employee benefits related to the addition of first niagara employees nonpersonnel expense increased 227 million due to higher intangible amortization expense and fdic assessment expense 

in 2015 key community bank’s net income attributable to key increased 15 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 40 million from 2014 the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth and the increased value of deposits was partially offset by tightening credit spreads compared to one year ago noninterest income increased 19 million from 2014 cards and payments income increased 16 million due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card income trust and investment services income increased 5 million driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions investment banking and debt placement fees increased 4 million driven by higher syndication fees and consumer mortgage was up 2 million these increases in noninterest income were 

partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts which were down 5 million from 2014 primarily due to reduced maintenance and overdraft fees and a 3 million decrease in other miscellaneous income the provision for loan and lease losses increased 11 million noninterest expense increased 24 million from 2014 personnel expense increased 16 million primarily due to increases in salaries incentive compensation and stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense increased 8 million primarily due to increased marketing spend and other support costs

key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 15  key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 634 million  for 2016  compared to 536 million  for 2015  and 544 million  for 2014  the 2016  increase was driven by an increase in revenue partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense 

taxableequivalent net interest income increased 161 million  or 182  in 2016  compared to 2015  this increase is primarily due to growth in balances with average loan and lease balances increasing 61 billion  or 235  and average deposit balances increasing 17 billion  or 91  the balance increases are due to the first niagara acquisition and growth in core businesses 

noninterest income increased 88 million  or 95  from 2015  investment banking and debt placement fees increased 32 million driven by growth in financial advisory equity capital markets and mortgage banking fees other noninterest income increased 26 million mostly driven by gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and higher trading income cards and payments income increased 15 million due to higher purchase and prepaid card revenue 

the provision for credit losses increased 17 million or 165 from 2015  primarily due to higher net loan chargeoffs 

noninterest expense increased 144 million  or 146  from 2015  personnel expense increased 56 million due to higher salaries incentive compensation benefits and stockbased compensation expense largely related to the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher performancebased compensation nonpersonnel expense increased 88 million due to higher operating lease expense cards and payments processing fdic assessment and other various expenses related to the acquisition of first niagara 

in 2015  key corporate bank’s net income attributable to key decreased 8 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 45 million in 2015  compared to 2014  due to increases in both earning asset spread and deposit and borrowing spread related to higher balance levels noninterest income increased 119 million due to increases in investment banking and debt placement fees other noninterest income corporate services income and trust and investment services income the provision for credit losses increased 89 million mostly due to increased net loan chargeoffs and higher provision for unfunded commitments noninterest expense increased 109 million mostly due to personnel expense related to the performance of the key corporate bank and the full year impact of the pacific crest securities acquisition as well as increases in various other expense categories

other segments 

other segments consist of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios other segments generated net income attributable to key of 83 million  for 2016  compared to 125 million  for 2015  and 156 million  for 2014  taxableequivalent net interest income decreased 36 million and noninterest income declined 30 million compared to 2015  due to lower gains from principal investments 

in 2015  other segments’ net income attributable to key decreased 31 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income decreased 31 million and noninterest income decreased 48 million these decreases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense of 23 million in 2015 primarily due to lower personnel expense

figure 16 composition of loans     



  



at december 31 2016  total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 86 billion  compared to 599 billion  at the end of 2015  loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 16 billion  at december 31 2016  and 18 billion  at december 31 2015  further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in note 14  “ acquisition divestiture and discontinued operations ” for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 619 billion  at december 31 2016  an increase  of 176 billion  or 398  compared to december 31 2015  

figure 17  provides our commercial loan portfolio by industry classification as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

figure 17 commercial loans by industry   

  

commercial financial and agricultural our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represented 46  of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2016  and 52  at december 31 2015  and is the largest component of our total loans these loans are originated by both key corporate bank and key community bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients 

we have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and keybanc capital markets our two largest industry classifications — commercial real estate and healthcare — increased by 218  and 129  respectively when compared to one year ago the commercial real estate and healthcare industries represented approximately 120  and 88  respectively of the total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31 2016  and approximately 125  and 99  respectively at december 31 2015  in addition utilities and financial which represented approximately 87  and 97  respectively of the commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31 2016  increased 386  and 154  respectively from one year ago the increases in our utilities and financial portfolios were due to the acquisition of first niagara 

our oil and gas loan portfolio represented 11 billion  of outstanding commercial financial and agricultural loans or 1  of total loans outstanding at december 31 2016  we have nearly 16 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to this sector focusing on middle market companies which is aligned with our relationship strategy 

the upstream segment comprising oil and gas exploration and production represents approximately 57  of our exposure is primarily secured by oil and gas reserves subject to a borrowing base and is regularly stresstested the midstream segment comprising mostly distribution companies has lower exposure to commodity risk oil field services exposure is minimal and concentrated in very few borrowers this mix was essentially unchanged from the prior year our total commitments in the oil and gas sector were approximately 32 billion  at december 31 2016  

commercial real estate loans  our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 15state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 69  of our average yeartodate commercial real estate loans compared to 68  one year ago keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate 

commercial real estate loans totaled  175 billion  at december 31 2016  and  9 billion  at december 31 2015  and represented 20  and 15  of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively the increase from december 31 2015  was due to the acquisition of first niagara these loans which include both owner and nonowneroccupied properties represented 28  and 20  of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively we continue to derisk the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate 

figure 18  includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as shown in figure 18  this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral our growth in the northeast region was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara 

as presented in figure 18  at december 31 2016  our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of 151 billion  and construction loans of 23 billion  representing 18  and 3  respectively of our total loans at december 31 2016  nonowneroccupied loans represented 16  of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represented 4  of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during the fourth  quarter of 2016  was 56 million  and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2016  had a balance of 741 million  at december 31 2016  our average construction loan commitment was 94 million  our largest construction loan commitment was 65 million  and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was 323 million  

also shown in figure 18  78  of our commercial real estate loans at december 31 2016  were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 72 at december 31 2015  approximately 17  of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2016  and 15 were construction loans at december 31 2015  typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments a significant decline in economic growth and in turn rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans 

figure 18 commercial real estate loans   



nonperforming loans related to nonowneroccupied properties increased  by 6 million  from december 31 2015  to 22 million  at december 31 2016  our nonowneroccupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 1094  or approximately 71 billion  since december 31 2015  primarily due to the first niagara acquisition the increase also reflects many of our clients who have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 

commercial lease financing we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 8  of commercial loans at december 31 2016  and 9  of commercial loans at december 31 2015  

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a casebycase basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or other income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions forgiveness of principal and other modifications loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our tdr loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr during 2016  we had 37 million  of new tdr commercial loans compared to 43 million  of new tdr commercial loans in 2015  

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 6  “ asset quality ” 

figure 19 commercial tdrs by accrual status     



we often use an ab note structure for our tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches first we create an a note since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in longterm markets and “takeout underwriting standards” of our various lines of business appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification 

the b note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the a note or b note dependent upon the terms of the restructure we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to tdrs alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current welldocumented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we consider the borrower’s ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a tdr loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

all loans processed as tdrs including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place at december 31 2016  we had 67 million  of a note commercial tdrs we did not have any b note commercial tdrs at december 31 2016  

additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 6  “ asset quality ” 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but they are often modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for the client the repayment source and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal pay down increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity the strength of the guarantor if any and the structure and residual risk of the transaction therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 

we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the highlevel objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and nearterm debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

mortgage and construction loans with a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 are accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support as of december 31 2016  we had one mortgage loan that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding increased  by 85 billion  or 546  from one year ago largely due to the acquisition of first niagara partially offset by paydowns in our home equity loan portfolio 

the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 99 of this portfolio at december 31 2016  was originated from our key community bank within our 15state footprint the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans in key community bank increased by 24 billion or 23 over the past twelve months primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara 

as shown in figure 14  we held the first lien position for approximately 57  of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2016  and 61  at december 31 2015  for consumer loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratios this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

at december 31 2016  43 of our home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages on at least a quarterly basis we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate

loans held for sale 

as shown in note 5  “ loans and loans held for sale ” our loans held for sale were 11 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 639 million  at december 31 2015  

at december 31 2016  loans held for sale included 1 billion  of commercial mortgages which increased  by 490 million  from december 31 2015  19 million  of commercial financial and agricultural loans which decreased  by 57 million  from december 31 2015  and 62 million  of residential mortgage loans which increased  by 45 million  from december 31 2015  we did not have any commercial lease financing loans held for sale at december 31 2016  a decrease  of 14 million  from december 31 2015  valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets including credit spreads treasury rates interest rate curves and risk profiles as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios we review our assumptions quarterly for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale see note 7  “ fair value measurements ” 

loan sales 

as shown in figure 21  which summarizes our loan sales for 2016  and 2015  during 2016  we sold 68 billion  of commercial real estate loans 354 million  of commercial lease financing loans 692 million  of residential real estate loans and 317 million  of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio however 140 million  of these loan sales related to the heldtomaturity portfolio

figure 22 loans administered or serviced     



  

in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 25 billion  of the 2248 billion  of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2016  additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 21  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 10  “ mortgage servicing assets ” 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

figure 23  shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2016  approximately 267 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year

securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements at december 31 2016  we had 200 billion  invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 142 billion  at december 31 2015  

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets including gnmarelated securities is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5  in the section entitled “net interest income” during 2016  average domestic deposits were 864 billion  and represented 85  of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 701 billion  and 85  during 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara higher interestbearing deposits resulting from core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from the commercial mortgage servicing business 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 13 billion  during 2016  compared to 17 billion  during 2015  the decrease from 2015  was caused by declines of 145 million  in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and 489 million  in foreign office deposits partially offset by an increase of 280 million  in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings 

at december 31 2016  we had 55 billion  in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 27  shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

capital 

at december 31 2016  our shareholders’ equity was 152 billion  up   45 billion  from december 31 2015  the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 23  “ shareholders equity ” 

ccar and capital actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhc’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions in april 2016 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2016  capital plan under the annual ccar process on june 29 2016 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016  capital plan share repurchases of up to 350 million were included in the 2016 capital plan which is effective through the second quarter of 2017 as previously reported we resumed our share repurchase program under the 2016 capital plan following the close of the first niagara acquisition we completed 133 million of common share repurchases during 2016 including repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans 

dividends 

as previously reported our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from 075 to 085 per share which was approved by our board in may 2016  an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend up to 095 per share will be considered by the board for the second quarter of the 2017 consistent with the 2016 capital plan other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings financial condition and other factors including regulatory review further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “regulatory capital and liquidity” 

consistent with the 2016  capital plan we made a dividend payment of 085 per share during each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2016  totaling 235 million and a dividend payment of 075 per share or 63 million during the first quarter of 2016  

we also made quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share on our series a preferred stock during each quarter of 2016  for a total of 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 we made a quarterly dividend payment of 539063 per share on our series c preferred stock for a total of 8 million we also made a quarterly dividend payment of 1333 per depositary share on the depositary shares related to our series d preferred stock for a total of 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 43291 holders of record at december 31 2016  our book value per common share was  1258  based on 108 billion  shares outstanding at december 31 2016  compared to 1251 based on 8358 million shares outstanding at december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  our tangible book value per common share was  999  compared to 1122 at december 31 2015

at december 31 2016  we had 1774 million treasury shares compared to 1812 million treasury shares at december 31 2015  during 2016  common shares outstanding increased by 244 million shares due to common shares issued to acquire first niagara and shares reissued under employee benefit plans partially offset by common share repurchases under our 2016  capital plan going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

as discussed in further detail in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report under the heading “capital planning and stress testing” we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year subject to the federal reserve’s notice of nonobjection pursuant to that requirement we will submit our 2017 capital plan to the federal reserve for review in april 2017 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2016  our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1117  at december 31 2016  compared to 1130 at december 31 2015  our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 809  at december 31 2016  compared to 998 at december 31 2015  

the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules which became effective on january 1 2015 for keycorp require higher and betterquality capital and introduced a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” the regulatory capital rules phased out the treatment of certain capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital the phaseout period which began january 1 2015 for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp resulted in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital starting in 2016 the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31 2016  calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “basel iii” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

as of january 1 2016  keycorp and its banking subsidiaries were each required to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60  a total riskbased capital ratio of 80  and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 40  at december 31 2016  our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio total riskbased capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio were 1089  1285  and 990  respectively compared to 1135  1297  and 1072  respectively at december 31 2015  information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of keycorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented in note 23  “ shareholders equity ” 

common equity tier 1 is not formally defined by gaap and is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4  in the “highlights of our performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to common equity tier 1 the corresponding nongaap measure beginning with the implementation of the regulatory capital rules deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from common equity tier 1 on a phasein basis as of december 31 2016  this balance was 4 million  as of january 1 2016  keycorp and its banking subsidiaries were each required to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 45 our common equity tier 1 ratio was 954  at december 31 2016

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 12  “ variable interest entities ” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2016  is presented in note 21  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 31  shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 21  under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 31  summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2016  by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 31 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments   



 

guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 21  under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the board’s audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal requirements independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions including internal audit as well as financial reporting legal matters and fraud risk the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 

the board’s risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies policies procedures and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprisewide risk including credit market liquidity model operational compliance reputation and strategic risks the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy capital planning and capital actions the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework which includes review of the erm policy including the risk appetite statement and management and erm reports the risk committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management 

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee annually the board reviews and approves the erm policy as well as the risk appetite including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating analyzing and reporting risk information risk review our internal audit function provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness appropriateness and adherence to keycorp’s risk management policies practices and controls 

the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions ensures appropriate ownership of risks provides input into performance and compensation decisions assesses aggregate enterprise risk monitors capabilities to manage critical risks and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline when market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 

we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement these positions are subject to various marketbased risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings are nontrading positions these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for 

liabilities the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions primarily changes in interest rates 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading investing and client facilitation activities principally within key corporate bank key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 7  “ fair value measurements ” in this report instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

  

 

 

 

var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s risk management group on an annual basis the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var 

we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level for all covered positions was 19 million at december 31 2016  and 12 million at december 31 2015  the increase in aggregate var was primarily due to the composition of our fixed income portfolio figure 32  summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  during this period none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits 

figure 32 var for significant portfolios of covered positions   



stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99 confidence level and applying certain assumptions the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 41 million at december 31 2016  and 35 million at december 31 2015  figure 33  summarizes our stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes 

figure 33 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions   



internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset position which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent 

assets specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

 

 

 

 

net interest income simulation analysis   the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view while simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures are managed within the risk appetite and board approved policy limits the results also reflect management’s desired interest rate risk positioning achieving the current modeled position typically requires purchases of investment securities to replace security cash flows and the execution of new interest rate swaps the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points but due to the low interest rate environment we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual parallel decrease of 75 basis points over five months with no change over the following seven months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment 

figure 34  presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modestly asset sensitive tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel 200 basis point increase or 75 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 55 in december 2016 the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 75 basis points as a result of the change our modeled exposure to declining rates increased the modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as shown in figure 34  we are operating within these levels as of december 31 2016  

figure 34 simulated change in net interest income 



simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve changes in credit spreads immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 34  net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts the modeling is sensitive to the volume of fixed rate assets and liabilities incorporated the modeling currently assumes approximately 28 billion of investment security purchases and swap executions over the next three years for every immediate reduction in fixed rate assets of 1 billion the modeled benefit to rising rates would increase by approximately 30 basis points the low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50 and 60 for interestbearing deposits and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling with the modeled betas varying by customer segment and product type recent deposit repricing has been lower than our modeled assumptions in the modeling if the deposit beta for the first 25 basis point move in the fed funds target rate was zero then returned to the standard modeled betas for the next 175 basis points of rate increases our modeled asset sensitive benefit would increase by approximately 200 basis points the sensitivity testing of assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within 100 basis points of modeled results 

our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling   eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2016  

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 35  shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 9  “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

figure 35 portfolio swaps by interest rate risk management strategy 





liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2016  are shown in figure 36  we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 36 credit ratings   



managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of 

funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2016  totaled 242 billion consisting of 217 billion of unpledged securities 416 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 21 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2016  our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 274 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 64 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in 2016 key’s outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances were reduced by 40 million due to repayments 

final us liquidity coverage ratio 

under the liquidity coverage rules we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key at december 31 2016  our estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

additional information about the liquidity coverage rules and modified lcr is included in the “supervision and regulation” section under the heading “regulatory capital requirements  liquidity requirements” in item 1 of this report 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2016  our loantodeposit ratio was 85  which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 19  “ longterm debt ” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on march 8 2016 keybank issued 1 billion of 235 senior bank notes due march 8 2019 under its global bank note program 

on may 20 2016 keybank issued 600 million of 340 subordinated bank notes due may 20 2026 under its global bank note program 

on august 22 2016 keybank issued 500 million of 160 senior bank notes due august 22 2019 under its global bank note program 

on september 9 2016 keycorp issued 525 million of depositary shares each representing a 125 th  ownership interest in a share of our fixedtofloating rate perpetual noncumulative series d preferred stock our series d preferred stock has a 1 par value with a 25000 liquidation preference 

on november 22 2016 keybank issued 500 million of 250 senior bank notes and 250 million of floating rate senior bank notes indexed to 3month libor both due november 22 2021 under its global bank note program 

on december 12 2016 keycorp issued 500 million of depositary shares each representing a 140 th  ownership interest in a share of our fixedtofloating rate perpetual noncumulative series e preferred stock our series e preferred stock has a 1 par value with a 1000 liquidation preference 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2016  keycorp held 34 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2016  keybank paid 625 million  in dividends to keycorp while other nonbank subsidiaries paid 50 million in dividends to keycorp at january 1 2017 keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 224 million  in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 169 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2016  as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 3 million in taxes to be paid we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2016  

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 21 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2016  we had seven client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these seven individual net obligor commitments was 55 million at december 31 2016  in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2016  we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 210 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity at december 31 2016  we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2016  the alll was 858 million  or 100  of periodend loans compared to 796 million  or 133  at december 31 2015  the allowance includes 37 million  that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 501 million  at december 31 2016  compared to  35 million  that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of  308 million  at december 31 2015  for more information about impaired loans see note 6  “ asset quality ” at december 31 2016  the alll was 1373  of nonperforming loans compared to 2057  at december 31 2015  

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 37  the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 37 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations   



 we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 

for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full on at least a quarterly basis we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses the alll at december 31 2016  represents our best estimate of the incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

as shown in figure 38  our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable increasing by 62 million  or 78  since 2015  our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit our commercial alll increased by 60 million  or 91  since 2015  primarily because of loan   growth in commercial financial and agricultural portfolio and an increase in incurred loss estimates during 2015 and into 2016 primarily due to the continued depressed oil and gas prices since 2014 our consumer alll increased by 2 million  or 14  since 2015  our consumer alll increase was primarily due to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios which were acquired at a premium this increase was partially offset by continued improvement in credit metrics which have decreased expected loss rates since 2014 the continued improvement in the consumer portfolio credit quality metrics since 2015 was primarily due to benefits of relatively stable economic conditions and improved delinquency rates average credit bureau scores and residential ltvs 

figure 38 allocation of the allowance for loan lease losses     



  

 our provision for credit losses was  266 million  for 2016  compared to 166 million for 2015  the increase in our provision is primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios which were acquired at a premium increased chargeoffs primarily in the oil and gas portfolio in 2016  compared to 2015  and loan growth we continue to reduce our exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net loan chargeoffs 

asset quality in our oil and gas loan portfolio which represents approximately 1 of total loans at december 31 2016  performed inline with our expectations in 2016  our reserve for credit losses allocated to our oil and gas loan exposure was 6 of the total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31 2016  and reflected the estimated impact of current oil prices at that date 

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2016  totaled 205 million  or 29  of average loans compared to net loan chargeoffs of 142 million or 24 for the same period last year figure 39  shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 40  

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased 63 million this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher chargeoffs in our commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio over the same period

as shown in figure 41  nonperforming assets increased during 2016  most of the increase came from nonperforming loans in our commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio primarily due to credit migration in the oil and gas portfolio

operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior 

management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients 

fourth quarter results 

figure 44  shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2016  are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 213 million or 20 per common share compared to 224 million or 27 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2015  

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016  was 69 compared to 97 for the fourth quarter of 2015  the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 788 for the fourth quarter of 2016  compared to 950 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

fourth quarter 2016 net interest income included 92 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of first niagara including 34 million related to refinement of third quarter 2016 purchase accounting estimates 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 948 million for the fourth quarter of 2016  and the net interest margin was 312 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 610 million and a net interest margin of 287 for the fourth quarter of 2015  the 338 million increase in net interest income and 25 basis point increase in net interest margin reflects the benefit from the acquisition of first niagara and ongoing business activity 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 618 million for the fourth quarter of 2016  compared to 485 million for the yearago quarter the increase was driven by the acquisition of first niagara as well as continued positive momentum in our core businesses investment banking and debt placement fees cards and payments income service charges on deposit accounts and other income all contributed to the growth 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 12 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016  during the quarter we incurred mergerrelated costs of 207 million and a pension settlement charge of 18 million the mergerrelated charges were primarily made up of 80 million in personnel expense related to systems conversions as well as fullydedicated personnel for merger and integration efforts the remaining 127 million of mergerrelated charges were nonpersonnel expense largely recognized in net occupancy computer processing business services and professional fees and marketing expense 

excluding mergerrelated charges noninterest expense was 283 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year the increase from the prior year reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense was largely driven by the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher incentive and stockbased compensation additionally we incurred 14 million in an increased pension settlement charge and intangible asset amortization increased 18 million 

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 66 million for the fourth quarter of 2016  compared to 45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015  our alll was 858 million or 100 of total periodend loans at december 31 2016  compared to 796 million or 133 at december 31 2015  

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2016  totaled 72 million or 34 of average loans compared to 37 million or 25 for the same period last year 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2016  we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 38 million compared to a tax provision of 73 million for the fourth quarter of 2015  the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016  was 141 compared to 239 for the same quarter one year ago due to lower pretax income resulting from mergerrelated charges increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards

discontinued operations see note 14 “acquisition divestiture and discontinued operations” 

 

figure 45 selected quarterly gaap to nongaap reconciliations   







critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2016  would indicate the need for a  24 million  increase in the allowance the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a  62 million  increase in the allowance such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a  24 million  increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately  15 million  or  02  per common share a  62 million  increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately  39 million  or  04  per common share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the alll would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1  under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgments assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1  under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 7  “ fair value measurements ” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2016  221 billion  or 16  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2016  15 billion  or 1  of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

at december 31 2016  22 million  or less than 1 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis all of these assets were classified as level 3 at december 31 2016  there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

during 2016 we elected the fair value option for our real estate — residential mortgage loans held for sale a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1  under the heading “loans held for sale” 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 185 million  at december 31 2016  a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2016  earnings by approximately  19 million   12 million  after tax or  01  per common share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1  under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we chose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2016  and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values our reporting units for purposes of the analysis are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 

if we chose the quantitative assessment we would perform the two step goodwill impairment test the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit this amount is estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on riskbased regulatory capital requirements if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill impairment may be indicated in such a case we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing and we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value then we would compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the 

carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill the impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to earnings 

the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a 78 million increase in the goodwill recorded in the key corporate bank unit approximately 72 million of the goodwill was allocated to kbcm in the second quarter of 2015 when pacific crest securities was fully merged into kbcm during the third quarter of 2015  goodwill increased 3 million to account for a tax item associated with the pacific crest business combination the acquisition of first niagara during the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a 14 billion increase in goodwill as a result of the acquisition 11 billion of goodwill was allocated to key community bank and 277 million of goodwill was allocated to key corporate bank additional information is provided in note 11  “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 17  “ employee benefits ” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2016  is provided in note 8  “ securities ” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices draft accounting guidance has been exposed that could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1  under the heading “derivatives” and note 9  “ derivatives and hedging activities ” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 21  “ commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees ” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 21  for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2016  

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future 

periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 13  “ income taxes ” 

during 2016  we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

acquisitions and divestitures 

on october 30 2015 we announced that keycorp entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which keycorp will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of first niagara the merger is currently expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of regulators and the shareholders of both keycorp and first niagara for more information on the first niagara acquisition and other acquisitions and divestitures by key see note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bhcs commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global institutions that offer financial services some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures the financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry enabling more companies including nonbank companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our product and service offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

as a bhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval by the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

under federal law a bhc must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress this support may be required when we do not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators 1 the occ for national banks and federal savings associations 2 the fdic for nonmember state banks and savings associations 3 the federal reserve for member state banks 4 the cfpb for consumer financial products or services 5 the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities 6 the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and 7 state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2015 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

regulatory capital and liquidity 

federal banking regulators have promulgated riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to key and keybank consolidated the adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities 

regulatory capital requirements prior to january 1 2015 

at december 31 2014 the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by federal banking regulators were based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” prior to january 2015 key and keybank consolidated were generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 at least half of the total capital had to be “tier 1 capital” which consists of qualifying perpetual preferred stock common shareholders’ equity excluding aoci other than the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and certain mandatorily convertible preferred securities the remainder could consist of “tier 2 capital” including qualifying subordinated debt certain hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt instruments qualifying perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses bhcs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities exceeding specified levels were required to maintain capital to cover their market risk exposure federal banking regulators also established a minimum leverage ratio requirement for banking organizations the leverage ratio is tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets at december 31 2014 the minimum leverage ratio was 3 for bhcs and national banks that are considered “strong” by the federal reserve or the occ respectively 3 for any bhc that had implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk and 4 for all other bhcs and national banks at december 31 2014 the minimum leverage ratio for key and keybank consolidated was 3 and 4 respectively bhcs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile or growth plans as presented in note 22 “shareholders’ equity” at december 31 2014 key and keybank consolidated had regulatory capital in excess of all applicable minimum riskbased capital including all adjustments for market risk and leverage ratio requirements 

basel iii capital and liquidity frameworks 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework to strengthen international capital regulation of banks and revised it in june 2011 and january 2014 as revised the “basel iii capital framework” the basel iii capital framework requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement and measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress the basel iii capital framework among other things introduces a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” to be included in tier 1 capital with other capital instruments meeting specified requirements a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer the basel iii capital framework is being phasedin over a multiyear period 

in november 2011 the basel committee issued its final rule for a common equity surcharge on certain designated global systemically important banks “gsibs” which was revised in july 2013 as revised “basel gsib framework” under the basel gsib framework a gsib is assessed a progressive 10 to 35 surcharge to the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer based upon the bank’s systemic importance score in july 2015 the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement the common equity surcharge on us gsibs the final rule was effective december 1 2015 although the surcharge which will be added to the capital conservation buffer under the regulatory capital rules will be phased in during the january 1 2016 through january 1 2019 period this final rule applies to advanced approaches banking organizations not “standardized approach” banking organizations like key 

 

the basel committee published its international liquidity standards in 2010 and revised them in january 2013 january 2014 and october 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” it established quantitative standards for liquidity by introducing a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” and a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” the basel committee published final basel iii nsfr disclosure standards in june 2015 

the basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of the stock of highquality liquid assets divided by total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days must be at least 100 the implementation of basel iii lcr began on january 1 2015 with minimum requirements beginning at 60 rising in annual steps of 10 until full implementation on january 1 2019 

the basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the available amount of stable funding divided by the required amount of stable funding must be at least 100 the basel iii nsfr becomes effective on january 1 2018 

us implementation of the basel iii capital framework 

in october 2013 the federal banking regulators published the final basel iii capital framework for us banking organizations the “regulatory capital rules” which generally implement the basel iii capital framework as described above in the united states under the regulatory capital rules certain large usdomiciled bhcs and banks each an “advanced approaches banking organization” must satisfy minimum qualifying criteria using organizationspecific internal risk measures and management processes for calculating riskbased capital requirements as well as follow certain methodologies to calculate their total riskweighted assets since neither keycorp nor keybank has at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least 10 billion of total onbalance sheet foreign exposure neither keycorp nor keybank is an advanced approaches banking organization instead each of them is a “standardized approach banking organization” 

new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements 

under the regulatory capital rules a standardized approach banking organization like keycorp is required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2015 key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 1085 under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules also at december 31 2015 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk would be as set forth in the following table 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 

 

  

  

  

 revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios 

federal prompt corrective action regulations under the fdia group fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank effective january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action rules table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the regulatory capital rules 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under 

revised prompt corrective action rules 

 

  

  

 we believe that as of december 31 2015 keybank consolidated met all revised “well capitalized” prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements under the regulatory capital rules the prompt corrective action regulations however apply only to fdicinsured depository institutions like keybank and not to bhcs like keycorp moreover since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank 

us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published the final basel iii liquidity framework for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” that create a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp 

keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules unless the occ affirmatively determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of keybank’s asset size level of complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system the lcr and modified lcr created by the liquidity coverage rules are also an enhanced prudential liquidity standard consistent with the doddfrank act 

because keycorp is a modified lcr bhc under the liquidity coverage rules key is required to maintain its ratio of highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflow amount determined by prescribed assumptions in a 

 

standardized hypothetical stress scenario over a 30calendar day period at least at 90 by january 1 2016 and at least at 100 by january 1 2017 at december 31 2015 key’s estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future key may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position calculation of key’s modified lcr is required on a monthly basis unlike on a daily basis for those us banking organizations that are subject to the lcr rather than the modified lcr on december 1 2015 the federal reserve published an npr requesting public comment on a proposed rule that would implement quarterly quantitative and qualitative public disclosure requirements regarding the lcr the proposed rule would require compliance with these requirements beginning on january 1 2018 for modified lcr bhcs like keycorp comments on the npr were due by february 2 2016 

the federal banking regulators have not yet issued any proposal to implement either the final basel iii nsfr or the final basel iii nsfr disclosure standards 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including key’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital positions as a large noncomplex bhc these expectations are set forth in the federal reserve’s guidance issued on december 18 2015 “sr letter 1519” under sr letter 1519 the federal reserve identifies its core capital planning expectations regarding governance risk management internal controls capital policy capital positions incorporating stressful conditions and events and estimating impact on capital positions for large and noncomplex firms building upon the capital planning requirements under its capital plan and stress test rules sr letter 1519 also provides detailed supervisory expectations on such a firm’s capital planning processes 

the federal reserve’s annual ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large complex us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have sufficient capital to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries 

keycorp filed its 2015 ccar capital plan on january 5 2015 keycorp is required to submit its 2016 ccar capital plan by april 6 2016 the federal reserve has indicated that it will announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by june 30 2016 with the exact date to be announced before then 

as part of the annual ccar the federal reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on keycorp as part of this test the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined annually by the federal reserve the 2015 ccar results which included the annual supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating covered companies including keycorp were publicly released by the federal reserve in march 2015 

in december 2015 the federal reserve published amendments to its capital plan and stress test rules under the amendments for a standardized approach bhc like keycorp the federal reserve has removed the tier 1 common capital ratio requirement as well as modified certain mandatory capital action assumptions the modifications to the mandatory capital action assumptions include the requirement for the bhc to assume in its 

 

stress tests that i it issues capital associated with funding a planned acquisition or merger to the extent the merger or acquisition is reflected in the bhc’s pro forma balance sheet estimates and ii it pays planned dividends on any issuance of stock related to expensed employee compensation the modifications also incorporate the deduction from tier 1 capital of a bhc’s investment in certain hedge funds and private equity funds that are covered by section 619 of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” 

keycorp and keybank must also conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank must only conduct an annual stress test keycorp must conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and occ keycorp is required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve keycorp and keybank published the results of their companyrun annual stress test on march 5 2015 keycorp published the results of its companyrun midcycle stress test on july 28 2015 summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests are disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosure” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

dividend restrictions 

federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be in a less than “adequately capitalized” prompt corrective action capital category or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositor’s deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institution’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

in november 2015 the fdic published an npr and request for comments proposing to impose a surcharge as required by the doddfrank act on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least 10 billion like keybank such surcharge would begin the calendar quarter after the dif reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 115 and would continue through the quarter that it 

 

first reaches or exceeds 135 at september 30 2015 the dif reserve ratio was 109 the surcharge would equal an annual rate of 000045 applied to the institution’s assessment base with certain adjustments the fdic expects that these surcharges will commence in 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the dif reserve ratio to 135 in approximately eight quarters ie before the end of 2018 if contrary to the fdic’s expectations the dif reserve ratio does not reach 135 by december 31 2018 provided it is at least 115 the fdic would impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of at least 10 billion like keybank on march 31 2019 the comment period for the npr expired in early january 2016 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind up a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to 

 

continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually by december 31 of each year for 2015 these resolution plans the third required from keycorp and keybank were submitted on december 1 2015 annually in january the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans in the prior december the public section of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans 

financial stability oversight council 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc a systemic risk oversight body to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

 

other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

“ volcker rule ” 

the volcker rule implements section 619 of the doddfrank act the volcker rule prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers banking entities may also engage in riskmitigating hedges if the entity can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the volcker rule 

although the volcker rule became effective on april 1 2014 on december 18 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2016 with respect to covered funds the federal reserve further indicated its intent to grant an additional oneyear extension of the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 and indicated it would reevaluate its rules relating to the process by which banking entities would be able to apply for further fiveyear extensions key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading “other investments” in item 7 of this report 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

 

the stress test requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a final rule adopted by the federal reserve in 2012 the resolution plan requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of these required enhanced prudential standards the enhanced prudential standards implemented by this final rule were i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits monitoring liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management including the requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

the sccl and the early remediation requirements published in january 2012 by the federal reserve as a proposed rule however were not included as part of the march 2014 final rule it is unclear when the federal reserve will finalize the early remediation requirements no credit exposure reporting requirements which must be implemented jointly by the federal reserve and fdic have yet been proposed the federal reserve has indicated that both the federal reserve and fdic recognize that such reports would be most useful and complete if developed in conjunction with the sccl 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm certain of the victory mutual funds with which we continue to have a relationship and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could 

 

have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the strong recovery in commercial real estate in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrower’s ability to cover the debt service payments 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing the widespread liquidation of assets and constraining the credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 74 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile that includes among other risks a borrower’s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which would result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and supervision 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

we face increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide financial market stability and enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions we expect continued intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly due to keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations we also face increased regulation from efforts designed to protect consumers from financial abuse although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts continue to be implemented as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act 

changes to existing statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and becoming subject to additional heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties 

 

these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

we are subject to a variety of operational risks 

in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources 

 

including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well 

 

designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

climate change severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

iv liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case 

new and evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the new capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital and liquidity” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s new capital standards will require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders capital securities usually are the most expensive form of funding and increasing capital levels could adversely impact key’s profitability 

in addition the new liquidity standards will require us to increase our holdings of higherquality liquid assets may require us to change our mix of investment alternatives and may impact business relationships with certain customers additionally support of the new liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost of funds than that of traditional core deposits 

further the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bank holding companies should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled “regulatory capital and liquidity” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment in light of recent moderate improvements in the us economy federal 

 

agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields which could have an unfavorable effect on the quantity and cost of borrowed funds in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including reducing our capacity of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the doddfrank act we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings following key’s announced acquisition of first niagara in october 2015 sp and fitch affirmed key’s ratings but changed the outlook to negative moody’s placed key’s ratings under review for downgrade the moody’s review could be outstanding beyond the targeted merger completion date a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could 

 

adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry additionally the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for key and affected our business and financial performance the lowinterest rate environment may persist for some time even as the economy continues to improve and may continue to have a negative impact on our performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans 

 

and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “risk management — management of interest risk exposure” found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments with which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — pacific rocky mountains indiana west ohiomichigan east ohio western new york eastern new york and new england — and potential exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery has been experienced unevenly in the various regions where we operate and continued improvement in the overall us economy may not result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the real estate healthcare and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce and embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace acquiring and expanding customer relationships including by “crossselling” additional or new products to them is also very important to our business model and our ability to grow revenue and earnings our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a strong employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased 

 

competition in the financial services industry and our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the federal reserve who may identify deficiencies in the structure causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

on october 30 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with first niagara pursuant to which first niagara will merge with and into keycorp with keycorp continuing as the surviving company acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms our inability to realize anticipated revenue and cost benefits and synergies increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities such as the first niagara merger may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share 

 

could occur in connection with any future transaction additionally if an acquisition including the first niagara merger or strategic partnership were to occur we may fail to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence or other projected benefits 

we may not be able to complete the acquisition of first niagara 

before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement with first niagara can be completed various approvals must be obtained from the bank regulatory and other governmental authorities in deciding whether to grant antitrust or regulatory clearances the relevant governmental entities will consider a variety of factors including the regulatory standing of each of the parties and the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain one or more of the required regulatory approvals or delay their receipt the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business or require branch divestitures the level of divestitures required by the relevant governmental entities might be unacceptable to the parties or could delay the closing of the merger or diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger if required by regulatory authorities we will divest branches in certain areas in a manner sufficient to eliminate such regulatory authorities’ competitive concerns despite the parties’ commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities under the terms of the merger agreement keycorp and first niagara will not be required to take actions that would be morelikelythannot to have a material and adverse effect on keycorp and its subsidiaries taken as a whole giving effect to the merger measured on a scale relative to first niagara and its subsidiaries taken as a whole there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions and that such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the merger imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe in addition we cannot provide assurance that any such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger additionally the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of the merger 

in addition to the various regulatory approvals the merger agreement is subject to a number of other conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger those conditions include but are not limited to approval of the merger agreement by first niagara and keycorp shareholders as well as approval of the amendment to keycorp’s articles by keycorp’s shareholders absence of orders prohibiting completion of the merger effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with the transaction and approval of the keycorp common shares and the new keycorp preferred stock to be issued to first niagara common and preferred stockholders as applicable for listing on the nyse the conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the merger may not be completed in addition the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time before or after shareholder approval or keycorp or first niagara may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances 

several putative class action lawsuits have been filed by purported first niagara stockholders alleging claims against first niagara the members of first niagara’s board of directors and keycorp among other remedies the purported plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain if the cases or any additional cases filed in connection with the merger are not resolved these lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the merger and result in significant costs to first niagara andor keycorp including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara 

keycorp and first niagara have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently the success of the merger including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend on among 

 

other things our ability to combine the businesses of keycorp and first niagara in a manner that permits growth opportunities including among other things enhanced revenues and revenue synergies an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of keycorp or first niagara nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation’s business financial condition operating results and prospects in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 

we will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the first niagara merger 

we have incurred and expect to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with consummating the first niagara merger in addition we will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as we integrate our business and first niagara’s business including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time we may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees we will also incur significant legal financial advisor accounting banking and consulting fees fees relating to regulatory filings and notices sec filing fees printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management and capital planning functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

 economic overview 

the economy continued its modest recovery in 2015 with overall gdp of 24 unchanged from the prior year 2015 was a volatile year with the first quarter starting at a slow pace then growth picking up over the next six months before decelerating again in the fourth quarter throughout 2015 slowing emerging market growth a strengthening us dollar and falling demand for us exports were all significant factors that held back growth additionally oil prices dropped 32 over the year giving consumers a boost in discretionary income but resulting in a sharp decline in energyrelated investments the stock market disappointed in 2015 with the sp 500 equity index dropping 1 compared to an 11 increase in 2014 largely due to uncertainty around chinese equity markets and oil and commodity prices globally the economic recovery slowed the european central bank maintained an easy money policy as their recovery stalled and the risk of deflation rose while emerging markets struggled in the face of low commodity prices and a weakening chinese economy 

for 2015 27 million new jobs were added in the us the unemployment rate fell further from 56 at december 31 2014 to 50 at december 31 2015 while weak labor force participation was a factor solid employment gains also drove the decline slack remains however reflected in underwhelming wage growth for much of the year consumers preferred to solidify their balance sheets in 2015 as the savings rate rose to 55 in december 2015 while consumer spending although still solid declined to 26 by december 2015 headline inflation remained at 7 mainly due to a further decline in energy prices core inflation also remained low throughout the year ending 2015 at 21 up from 16 at the end of 2014 

as the economy expanded further and the labor market continued to strengthen the housing market gained traction with slight improvement across nearly all metrics in 2015 while household formation is normalizing a declining home ownership rate continues to weigh on sales growth existing home sales finished 2015 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546 million up 77 from december 2014 new home sales ended the year on a solid note reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544000 in december 2015 up 99 from 2014 price appreciation picked up modestly with the median price for existing homes up 63 yearoveryear in december 2015 compared to 46 in 2014 housing starts accelerated further up 64 from december 2014 driven by gains in both single and multifamily construction of 61 and 70 respectively 

the federal reserve remained active and accommodative for most of 2015 the federal open market committee “fomc” decided to maintain the existing policy of reinvesting principal payments to help accommodate financial conditions throughout the year in addition the fomc kept the federal funds target rate near zero until december 2015 lifting the target rate by 25 basis points citing an improving labor market and the expectation that inflation would return to its 2 objective over the medium term the 10year us treasury yield began the year at 22 and dipped to as low as 17 for the first quarter of 2015 driven by disappointing weatherrelated economic data in the third quarter of 2015 with rising speculation around higher interest rates the 10year us treasury yield began to increase reaching 24 and ended the year at 23 as interest rates eased even after the fomc raised rates due to concerns of slower global growth lower energy prices and equity market volatility

 corporate strategy 

we remain committed to enhancing longterm shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model growing our franchise and being disciplined in our management of capital our 20152016 strategic focus is to grow by building enduring relationships through clientfocused solutions and service we intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships effectively managing risk and rewards maintaining financial strength and engaging retaining and inspiring our diverse and highperforming workforce these strategic priorities for enhancing longterm shareholder value are described in more detail below 

 

  

  

  

  

 strategic developments 

we initiated the following actions during 2015 to support our corporate strategy 

 

  

  

  

  

 highlights of our 2015 performance 

financial performance 

for 2015 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 892 million or 105 per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 917 million or 104 per common share for 2014 

figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years 

figure 3 results of operations 

 

  

  

 our 2016 expectations as disclosed below do not include the effect of the pending first niagara merger which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016 

our 2015 fullyear results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management 

our taxableequivalent net interest income for 2015 was 2376 billion and the net interest margin was 288 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2317 billion and a net interest margin of 297 for the prior year the increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields which also drove the decline in the net interest margin in 2016 we expect lowsingledigit less than 5 growth in net interest income without the benefit of higher interest rates or midsingledigit 4 to 6 growth with the benefit of higher interest rates compared to the prior year 

 

our noninterest income was 19 billion up 83 million or 46 from 2014 investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year increasing 48 million from 2014 trust and investment services income increased 30 million primarily due to the fullyear 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of 20 million in corporate services income due to higher loan commitment fees and 17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume other income also increased 10 million these increases were partially offset by declines of 27 million in net gains from principal investing and 23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains in 2016 we expect midsingledigit 4 to 6 growth in noninterest income compared to 2015 

our noninterest expense was 28 billion an increase of 79 million or 29 from 2014 we recognized 61 million of merger efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2015 compared to 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2014 personnel expense increased 61 million driven by higher incentive and stockbased compensation employee benefits and salaries partially offset by lower technology contract labor and severance nonpersonnel expense increased 18 million primarily due to increases in marketing of 8 million and computer processing of 6 million in 2016 we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable plus or minus 2 with 2015 

average loans totaled 586 billion for 2015 compared to 557 billion in 2014 commercial financial and agricultural loan growth of 33 billion was broadbased across our commercial lines of business consumer loans were slightly down as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio primarily direct term loans and credit cards were offset by runoff in our designated consumer exit portfolio for 2016 we anticipate average loan growth in the midsingledigit 4 to 6 range 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 701 billion for 2015 an increase of 29 billion compared to 2014 now and money market deposit accounts and demand deposits increased 2 billion and 19 billion respectively reflecting growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients these increases were partially offset by runoff in certificates of deposit and other time deposits our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 878 at december 31 2015 compared to 846 at december 31 2014 

we maintained credit discipline in 2015 and our asset quality ratios remained strong the provision for credit losses was 166 million for 2015 compared to 57 million for 2014 the increase in our provision is due to the growth in our loan portfolio over the past twelve months as well as lower recoveries in 2015 compared to 2014 net loan chargeoffs were 142 million or 24 of average loan balances for 2015 compared to 113 million or 20 for 2014 our nonperforming loans declined to 387 million or 65 of periodend loans at december 31 2015 compared to 418 million or 73 at december 31 2014 our alll was 796 million or 133 of periodend loans compared to 794 million or 138 at december 31 2014 and represented 206 and 190 coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively in 2016 we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and the alll as a percentage of periodend loans to remain relatively stable plus or minus 2 which would approximate a three basis point change with 2015 

our capital ratios remain strong our tangible common equity and tier 1 riskbased capital ratios were 998 and 1135 respectively at december 31 2015 compared to 988 and 1190 respectively at december 31 2014 in addition our common equity tier 1 was 1094 at december 31 2015 we have identified four primary uses of capital 

 

  

  

  

  

our capital management remains focused on creating value during 2015 our fullyear dividend per common share increased 16 from the prior year and we repurchased 460 million of common shares 

figure 4 presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible common equity” “common equity tier 1” “tier 1 common equity” “preprovision net revenue” “cash efficiency ratio” and “common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules estimates” 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as common equity tier 1 because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on common equity tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories the regulatory capital rules described in more detail under the section “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report also make common equity tier 1 a priority the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by among other changes phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital starting in 2016 our trust preferred securities will only be included in tier 2 capital since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and common equity tier 1 we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

figure 4 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

 results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

  

  

  

 to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie 

 

as if it were all taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2015 was 2376 billion and the net interest margin was 288 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2317 billion and a net interest margin of 297 for the prior year the 59 million increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields which also drove the decline in the net interest margin 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2014 decreased 31 million compared to 2013 and the net interest margin declined 15 basis points the decreases in net interest income and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields loan growth the maturity of higherrate certificates of deposit and a more favorable mix of lowercost deposits and wholesale borrowings partially offset the impact of lower earning asset yields 

average earning assets totaled 825 billion for 2015 compared to 781 billion in 2014 contributing to the 2015 increase in average earning assets was average loan growth of 29 billion driven by commercial financial and agricultural loans which increased 33 billion and was broadbased across our commercial lines of business in addition our average securities available for sale portfolio increased 15 billion compared to 2014 due to higher levels of liquidity driven by deposit growth and longterm debt issuances which benefited keybank’s lcr and credit ratings profile 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 701 billion for 2015 an increase of 29 billion compared to 2014 now and money market deposit accounts increased 2 billion and demand deposits increased 19 billion reflecting growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients these increases were partially offset by runoff in certificates of deposit and other time deposits

 noninterest income 

as shown in figure 7 noninterest income for 2015 was 188 billion up 83 million or 46 from 2014 investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record year increasing 48 million from 2014 trust and investment services income increased 30 million primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities noninterest income for 2015 also included increases of 20 million in corporate services income due to higher nonyield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income and 17 million in cards and payments income due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume other income also increased 10 million these increases were partially offset by declines of 27 million in net gains from principal investing and 23 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains 

in 2014 noninterest income increased 31 million or 18 compared to 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 64 million from 2013 net gains from principal investing were 26 million higher than prior year and trust and investment services income increased 10 million primarily due to the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities these increases were partially offset by declines of 21 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains 20 million in service charges on deposit accounts 12 million in mortgage servicing fees and 9 million in consumer mortgage income other income also decreased 15 million

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 9 for 2015 trust and investment services income increased 30 million or 74 from the prior year primarily due to the full year 2015 impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities for 2014 trust and investment services income increased 10 million or 25 from the prior year 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2015 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 340 billion compared to 392 billion at december 31 2014 and 369 billion at december 31 2013 as shown in figure 9 the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to client attrition in the securities lending portfolio and market declines across all the portfolios increases from 2013 to 2014 across all the portfolios were attributable to market appreciation 

 

figure 9 assets under management 

 

 investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2015 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 48 million or 121 from the prior year for 2014 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 64 million or 192 from the prior year these increases were primarily driven by strength in syndication and financial advisory fees as well as the impact of the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts declined 5 million or 19 in 2015 compared to the prior year and 20 million or 71 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower overdraft charges resulting from changes in posting order 

operating lease income and other leasing gains 

operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased 23 million or 24 during 2015 compared to the prior year and 21 million or 179 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on the early terminations of leveraged leases figure 10 shows the corresponding operating lease expense related to the rental of leased equipment 

corporate services income 

corporate services income increased 20 million or 112 in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by higher nonyield loan fees and dealer trading and derivatives income corporate services income increased 6 million or 35 in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by higher nonyield loan fees 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 17 million or 102  in 2015 compared to 2014 and 4 million or 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 the increases were due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume 

consumer mortgage income 

consumer mortgage income increased 2 million or 20 in 2015 compared to 2014 this increase was primarily driven by gains on the sales of consumer mortgage loans consumer mortgage income decreased 9 million or 474 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower mortgage originations caused by increasing mortgage interest rates 

 

mortgage servicing fees 

mortgage servicing fees increased 2 million or 43 in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower mortgage servicing fee amortization expense mortgage servicing fees decreased 12 million or 207 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower special servicing fees 

other income 

other income which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale other service charges and certain dealer trading income increased 10 million or 227 in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased 15 million or 254 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to changes in various miscellaneous income categories 

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 10 noninterest expense for 2015 was 284 billion an increase of 79 million or 29 from 2014 we recognized 61 million of merger efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2015 compared to 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2014 as shown in figure 11 personnel expense increased 61 million driven by higher incentive and stockbased compensation employee benefits and salaries partially offset by lower technology contract labor and severance nonpersonnel expense increased 18 million primarily due to increases in marketing of 8 million and computer processing of 6 million 

noninterest expense for 2014 was 2761 billion a decrease of 51 million or 18 from 2013 we recognized 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2014 compared to 117 million in 2013 we also recognized 22 million of noninterest expense in 2014 related to pacific crest securities which we acquired during the third quarter of 2014 as shown in figure 11 personnel expense decreased by 18 million in 2014 due to declines in technology contract labor severance and employee benefits partially offset by an increase in incentive and stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 33 million primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs and equipment expense 

figure 10 noninterest expense 

 

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 11 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 61 million or 38 in 2015 compared to 2014 increases in incentive and stockbased compensation of 30 million 

 

employee benefits of 26 million and salaries of 21 million all contributed to the increase in personnel expense these increases were partially offset by declines in technology contract labor of 10 million and severance of 6 million 

personnel expense decreased by 18 million or 11 from 2013 to 2014 declines in technology contract labor of 16 million severance of 14 million and employee benefits of 15 million all contributed to the decrease these declines were partially offset by an increase in incentive and stockbased compensation of 27 million related to the performance of our business and the september 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities 

figure 11 personnel expense 

 

  

 net occupancy 

net occupancy expense decreased 6 million or 23 in 2015 compared to 2014 and 14 million or 51 in 2014 compared to 2013 these declines were primarily due to lower charges related to vacating leased property and a decrease in rental expenses 

operating lease expense 

operating lease expense increased 5 million or 119 in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased depreciation expense on operating lease equipment related to new business operating lease expense decreased 5 million or 106 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains” 

other expense 

other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment costs associated with technology service providers and franchise and business taxes other expense increased 10 million or 30 in 2015 compared to 2014 and declined 4 million or 12 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to fluctuations in several of those line items 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 303 million for 2015 compared to a tax provision of 326 million for 2014 and 271 million for 2013 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 248 for 2015 compared to 256 for 2014 and 237 for 2013 

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic 

 

adjustments to our tax reserves in 2015 our effective tax rate was reduced by additional federal tax credit refunds filed for prior years in addition in 2014 and 2013 our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs 

we recorded a valuation allowance of 4 million at december 31 2015 compared to 3 million at december 31 2014 and 1 million at december 31 2013 against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards

 key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 13 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 256 million for 2015 compared to 242 million for 2014 and 197 million for 2013 the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in net interest income as the value of deposits increased and noninterest income partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense 

taxableequivalent net interest income increased 40 million or 28 from 2014 average loans and leases grew 729 million while average deposits increased 837 million compared to 2014 the positive contribution to 

 

net interest income from loan and deposit growth and the increased value of deposits was partially offset by tightening credit spreads compared to one year ago 

noninterest income increased 20 million or 26 from 2014 cards and payments income increased 16 million or 105 due to higher merchant services purchase card and atm debit card income driven by increased volume trust and investment services income increased 5 million or 17 driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions investment banking and debt placement fees and consumer mortgage fees also contributed to the higher noninterest income these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts of 5 million primarily due to reduced overdraft fees and a decrease in other miscellaneous income 

the provision for loan and lease losses increased 11 million or 186 from 2014 primarily due to loan growth net loan chargeoffs decreased 25 million from 2014 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio 

noninterest expense increased 27 million or 15 from 2014 personnel expense increased 19 million primarily due to increases in salaries and incentive and stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense increased 8 million primarily due to increased marketing spend and other support costs 

in 2014 key community bank’s net income attributable to key increased 45 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income declined 85 million from 2013 the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2014 driven by the prolonged lowrate environment noninterest income decreased 15 million from 2013 service charges on deposit accounts declined 19 million from 2013 primarily due to reduced overdraft fees resulting from changes in posting order consumer mortgage income decreased 9 million from 2013 due to lower refinancing activity and operating leasing income and other leasing gains declined 4 million these decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by an 8 million increase in cards and payments income and a 9 million increase in other miscellaneous income the provision for credit losses decreased 84 million noninterest expense declined 87 million from 2013 personnel expense decreased primarily due to declines in salaries incentive and stockbased compensation and employee benefits expenses nonpersonnel expense declined primarily due to decreases in outside loan servicing fees computer processing intangible asset amortization and other support costs

 key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14 key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 545 million for 2015 compared to 548 million for 2014 and 529 million for 2013 the 2015 decrease was driven by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense partially offset by an increase in revenue 

taxableequivalent net interest income increased 45 million or 54 in 2015 compared to 2014 the growth was primarily driven by a 45 million increase in the deposit and other borrowing spread due to a 2 billion increase in average deposit balances earning asset spread increased 26 million due to a 29 billion increase in average loan and lease balances these increases were partially offset by decreases in other components of net interest income 

noninterest income increased 120 million or 149 from 2014 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 47 million due to a fullyear impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition as well as the strength of our business model trust and investment services income increased 25 million mostly due to the fullyear impact of the pacific crest securities acquisition corporate services income increased 23 million due to growth in nonyield loan fees associated with increases in loans derivatives fees and foreign exchange fees other noninterest income increased 25 million mostly driven by gains related to the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and higher trading income 

the provision for credit losses increased 89 million or 6357 from 2014 primarily due to a 29 billion increase in average loan and lease balances as well as a return to a more normal credit environment net loan chargeoffs increased 58 million from 2014 due to both higher chargeoffs and lower recoveries in 2015 

noninterest expense increased 102 million or 118 from 2014 this increase was primarily driven by a 66 million increase in personnel expense due to higher incentive and stockbased compensation expense related to 

 

the performance of the key corporate bank and the fullyear impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition in addition there were increases in various other expense categories related to higher staffing and volume levels 

in 2014 key corporate bank’s net income attributable to key increased 19 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 45 million in 2014 compared to 2013 as increases in earning asset spread from higher earning asset balances offset a decrease in deposit spread from a decline in rates noninterest income increased 44 million as increases in investment banking and debt placement fees corporate services income and trust and investment services income more than offset decreases in mortgage servicing fees trading income and other noninterest income categories the provision for credit losses decreased 4 million due to improved credit quality within the portfolio noninterest expense increased 57 million mostly due to higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance of the key corporate bank and the partialyear impact of the september 2014 pacific crest securities acquisition as well as increases in various other expense categories

other segments 

other segments consist of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios other segments generated net income attributable to key of 124 million for 2015 compared to 158 million for both 2014 and 2013 taxableequivalent net interest income decreased 33 million and noninterest income declined 47 million compared to 2014 due to lower operating lease income and other leasing gains and gains from principal investments these decreases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in noninterest expense of 23 million in 2015 primarily due to lower personnel expense 

in 2014 other segments’ net income attributable to key was flat from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 6 million and noninterest income increased 8 million noninterest expense declined 6 million these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses of 11 million

 at december 31 2015 total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 599 billion compared to 574 billion at the end of 2014 and 545 billion at the end of 2013 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 18 billion at december 31 2015 23 billion at december 31 2014 and 45 billion at december 31 2013 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 443 billion at december 31 2015 an increase of 29 billion or 70 compared to december 31 2014 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 15 our commercial financial and agricultural loans represent 52 and 49 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively and are the largest component of our total loans these loans are originated by both key corporate bank and key community bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans increased 33 billion or 116 from one year ago 

figure 16 provides our commercial financial and agricultural loans by industry classification as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 

figure 16 commercial financial and agricultural loans 

 

 commercial financial and agricultural loans increased 33 billion or 116 from december 31 2014 with key corporate bank increasing 3 billion and key community bank up 340 million we have experienced 

 

growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and institutional and capital markets business our two largest industry classifications — services and manufacturing — increased by 111 and 68 respectively when compared to one year ago the services and manufacturing industries represented approximately 22 and 16 respectively of the total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31 2015 and approximately 22 and 17 respectively at december 31 2014 at the end of 2015 and 2014 loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for approximately 37 and 38 respectively of our total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio 

services manufacturing and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge our loans in the services classification grew by 669 million or 111 compared to last year loans in the manufacturing classification grew by 316 million or 68 compared to the same period one year ago increases in lending to large corporate middle market and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification loans in public utilities increased by 643 million or 332 compared to december 31 2014 due to growth from our alternative energy and renewable energy clients 

our loans in the financial services and transportation classifications increased 81 and 202 respectively compared to the prior year the increase in financial services loans was primarily attributable to growth in real estate investment trust balances the increase in transportation loans was primarily attributable to loan growth for rail cars and shipping containers 

our oil and gas loan portfolio included within the public utilities and mining industry classifications in figure 16 focuses on lending to middle market companies and represents approximately 2 of total loans outstanding at december 31 2015 we have nearly 15 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to this sector focusing on middle market companies which is aligned with our relationship strategy 

the upstream segment comprising oil and gas exploration and production represents approximately onehalf of our exposure is primarily secured by oil and gas reserves subject to a borrowing base and regularly stresstested the midstream segment comprising mostly distribution companies has lower exposure to commodity risk oil field services exposure is minimal and concentrated in very few borrowers this mix was essentially unchanged from the prior year our total commitments in the energy sector were approximately 3 billion at december 31 2015 slightly lower than the prior year 

commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans represent 15 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2015 compared to 16 at december 31 2014 these commercial real estate loans including both owner and nonowneroccupied properties represented 20 of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31 2015 compared to 22 one year ago these loans have decreased 135 million or 15 to 9 billion at december 31 2015 from 91 billion at december 31 2014 our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 12state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 68 of our average yeartodate commercial real estate loans compared to 61 one year ago keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate 

figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as shown in figure 17 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral 

 

as presented in figure 17 at december 31 2015 our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of 8 billion and construction loans of 11 billion representing 13 and 2 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represented 11 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represented 4 of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2015 was 55 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2015 had a balance of 693 million at december 31 2015 our average construction loan commitment was 85 million our largest construction loan commitment was 48 million and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was 43 million 

also shown in figure 17 at december 31 2015 72 of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 70 at december 31 2014 approximately 15 of these loans were construction loans at both december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments a significant decline in economic growth and in turn in rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans 

figure 17 commercial real estate loans 

 

  

 during 2015 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 5 million from 21 million at december 31 2014 to 16 million at december 31 2015 as a result of continued improvement in asset quality and market conditions this category of loans declined by 2 million during 2014 

since december 31 2014 our nonowneroccupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by approximately 84 million or 13 as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 

 

commercial lease financing we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 9 of commercial loans at december 31 2015 and 10 at december 31 2014 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a casebycase basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or other income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions forgiveness of principal and other modifications loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr during 2015 we had 53 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to 22 million of new restructured commercial loans in 2014 

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 5 “asset quality” 

figure 18 commercial tdrs by accrual status 

 

 we often use an ab note structure for our tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches first we create an a note since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in longterm markets and “takeout underwriting standards” of our various lines of business appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification 

 

the b note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the a note or b note dependent upon the terms of the restructure we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to tdrs alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current welldocumented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we consider the borrower’s ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

all loans processed as tdrs including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place at december 31 2015 we had 47 million and 7 million of a note and b note commercial tdrs respectively 

additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 5 “asset quality” 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but they are often modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for the client the repayment source and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal pay down increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity the strength of the guarantor if any and the structure and residual risk of the transaction therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 

we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the highlevel objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and nearterm debt maturities 

 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

mortgage and construction loans with a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 are accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support as of december 31 2015 we did not have any mortgage and construction loans that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding decreased by 396 million or 25 from one year ago the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 98 of this portfolio at december 31 2015 was originated from key community bank within our 12state footprint the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans in key community bank decreased by 239 million or 23 over the past 12 months 

as shown in figure 13 we hold the first lien position for approximately 61 of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2015 and 60 at december 31 2014 for consumer loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratio this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively and therefore prior periods were not adjusted at december 31 2015 39 of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages on at least a quarterly basis we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate

 loans held for sale 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale were 639 million at december 31 2015 compared to 734 million at december 31 2014 during 2015 we recorded net gains from loan sales of 103 million there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 

at december 31 2015 loans held for sale included 532 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by 106 million from december 31 2014 76 million of commercial financial and agricultural loans which increased by 13 million from december 31 2014 17 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by 1 million from december 31 2014 and 14 million of commercial lease financing which decreased by 1 million from december 31 2014 valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets including credit spreads treasury rates interest rate curves and risk profiles as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios we review our assumptions quarterly for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale see note 6 “fair value measurements” 

loan sales 

as shown in figure 20 during 2015 we sold 60 billion of commercial real estate loans 415 million of commercial lease financing loans 554 million of residential real estate loans and 335 million of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio 

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are

 figure 21 shows loans that are either administered or serviced by us but not recorded on the balance sheet the table includes loans that have been sold 

figure 21 loans administered or serviced 

 

  

 in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 18 billion of the 214 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2015 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” 

 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates

 securities 

our securities portfolio totaled 191 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 184 billion at december 31 2014 availableforsale securities were 142 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 134 billion at december 31 2014 heldtomaturity securities were 49 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 5 billion at december 31 2014 

as shown in figure 23 all of our mortgagebacked securities which include both securities available for sale and heldtomaturity securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in liquid secondary markets these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the availableforsale portfolio and at cost for the heldtomaturity portfolio for more information about these securities see note 6 “fair value measurements” under the heading “qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques” and note 7 “securities” 

figure 23 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 

 

  

 securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and 

 

provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements at december 31 2015 we had 142 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 133 billion at december 31 2014 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

throughout 2014 and 2015 our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in gnmarelated securities is also related to liquidity management strategies as we continue to prepare for future regulatory requirements

 other investments 

principal investments — investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 46 and 53 of other investments at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively they include direct investments investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value the fair value of the direct investments was 69 million at december 31 2015 and 104 million at december 31 2014 while the fair value of the indirect investments was 235 million at december 31 2015 and 302 million at december 31 2014 under the requirements of the volcker rule we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments the federal reserve extended the conformance period to july 21 2016 for all banking entities with respect to covered funds the federal reserve also indicated its intent to exercise the authority granted by section 13 of the bank holding company act to grant the final oneyear extension until july 21 2017 if this authority is not exercised by the federal reserve key is permitted to file for an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time we plan to apply for the extension if not granted automatically and hold the investments as of december 31 2015 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments for more information about the volcker rule see the discussion in item 1 under the heading “other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act – ‘volcker rule’” in the section entitled “supervision and regulation” 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain realestaterelated investments and an indirect ownership interest in a partnership that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost the realestaterelated investments were valued at 8 million at december 31 2015 and 10 million at december 31 2014 the indirect investment 

 

in a partnership was valued at 4 million at december 31 2014 under the requirements of the volcker rule we were required to dispose of this investment prior to december 31 2015 the investment was redeemed additional information pertaining to the equity investment is included in the “changes in level 3 fair value measurements” section of note 6 “fair value measurements” 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information this review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry thirdparty data and other relevant factors as of december 31 2015 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 51 million which includes 47 million of net unrealized losses these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6 

deposits and other sources of funds 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled “net interest income” during 2015 average domestic deposits were 701 billion and represented 85 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 673 billion and 86 during 2014 now and money market deposit accounts increased 20 billion and noninterestbearing deposits increased 19 billion reflecting continued growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients these increases were partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 17 billion during 2015 compared to 24 billion during 2014 the decrease from 2014 was caused by declines of 550 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements 126 million in foreign office deposits and 25 million in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings 

at december 31 2015 we had 24 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

 capital 

at december 31 2015 our shareholders’ equity was 107 billion up 216 million from december 31 2014 the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity 

 

ccar and capital actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhc’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions in january 2015 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2015 capital plan under the annual ccar process on march 11 2015 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan the 2015 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to 725 million which includes repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans common share repurchases under the 2015 capital plan began in the second quarter of 2015 and were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the pending merger with first niagara share repurchases are expected to be included in the upcoming 2016 ccar submission 

during 2015 we repurchased 252 million of common shares under our 2015 capital plan authorization in addition during the first quarter of 2015 we repurchased 208 million of common shares under our 2014 capital plan for a total of 460 million of common share repurchases during 2015 

dividends 

as previously reported our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from 065 to 075 per share which was approved by our board in may 2015 an additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend up to 085 per share will be considered by the board in 2016 for the fifth quarter of the 2015 capital plan other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings financial condition and other factors including regulatory review further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “regulatory capital and liquidity” 

consistent with the 2015 capital plan we made a dividend payment of 075 per share during each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2015 totalling 189 million and a dividend payment of 065 per share or 55 million during the first quarter of 2015 

we also made quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share on our series a preferred stock during each quarter of 2015 for a total of 23 million 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 27058 holders of record at december 31 2015 our book value per common share was 1251 based on 8358 million shares outstanding at december 31 2015 compared to 1191 based on 8594 million shares outstanding at december 31 2014 at december 31 2015 our tangible book value per common share was 1122 compared to 1065 at december 31 2014 

figure 45 in the section entitled “fourth quarter results” shows the market price ranges of our common shares per common share earnings and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years 

figure 27 compares the price performance of our common shares based on an initial investment of 100 on december 31 2010 and assuming reinvestment of dividends with that of the standard  poor’s 500 index and a group of other banks that constitute our peer group the peer group consists of the banks that make up the standard  poor’s 500 regional bank index and the banks that make up the standard  poor’s 500 diversified bank index we are included in the standard  poor’s 500 index and the peer group

 at december 31 2015 we had 1812 million treasury shares compared to 1576 million treasury shares at december 31 2014 during 2015 common shares outstanding decreased by 24 million shares due to common share repurchases under our 2014 and 2015 capital plans partially offset by the net share activity under our employee benefit plans and shares of series a preferred stock that were exchanged for common shares going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

as discussed in further detail in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report under the heading “capital planning and stress testing” we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year subject to the federal reserve’s notice of nonobjection pursuant to that requirement we will submit our 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve for review in april 2016 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2015 our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1130 at december 31 2015 compared to 1122 at december 31 2014 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 998 at december 31 2015 compared to 988 at december 31 2014 

 

federal banking regulators have promulgated minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements for bhcs like keycorp and their banking subsidiaries like keybank as of january 1 2015 key and keybank consolidated were each required to maintain a minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 600 a total riskbased capital ratio of 800 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 400 at december 31 2015 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio total riskbased capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio were 1135 1297 and 1072 respectively compared to 1190 1389 and 1126 respectively at december 31 2014 in addition as of january 1 2015 key and keybank consolidated were each required to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 45 at december 31 2015 our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 1094 

the adoption of the regulatory capital rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital the phaseout period which began january 1 2015 for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital starting in 2016 the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute 85 million or 9 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 1135 and tier 1 leverage ratio of 1072 at december 31 2015 the trust preferred securities contribute 340 million or 38 basis points to our total riskbased capital ratio of 1297 at december 31 2015 the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of key at december 31 2015 calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

as previously indicated in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios” the prompt corrective action capital category regulations do not apply to bhcs if however these regulations did apply to bhcs we believe keycorp would qualify for the “well capitalized” capital category at december 31 2015 moreover after accounting for the phaseout of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible and as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2015 we estimate keycorp would still qualify for the “well capitalized” capital category under the regulatory capital rules with an estimated tier 1 riskbased capital ratio estimated tier 1 leverage ratio estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio and estimated total riskbased capital ratio of 1126 1063 1094 and 1297 respectively the new threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the regulatory capital rules are described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios” since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “regulatory capital and liquidity” in “supervision and regulation” under item 1 of this report 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations the federal reserve’s assessment of capital adequacy previously focused on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of sifis including keycorp the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules which became effective on january 1 2015 for key require higher and betterquality capital and introduced a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” common equity tier 1 is not formally defined by gaap and is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4 in the “highlights of our performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to common equity tier 1 the corresponding nongaap measure our common equity tier 1 ratio was 1094 at december 31 2015 

at december 31 2015 for key’s consolidated operations we had a federal net deferred tax asset of 289 million and a state deferred tax asset of 32 million compared to a federal net deferred tax asset of 195 million and a state deferred tax asset of 22 million at december 31 2014 we had a valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards of 

 

less than 1 million at december 31 2015 and at december 31 2014 starting with the implementation of the regulatory capital rules on january 1 2015 deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from common equity tier 1 on a phasein basis as of december 31 2015 this balance was approximately 1 million

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 11 “variable interest entities” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2015 is presented in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 31 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 20 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 31 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2015 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 31 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

  

  

guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 20 under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the board’s audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal requirements independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions including internal audit as well as financial reporting legal matters and fraud risk the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 

the board’s risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies policies procedures and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprisewide risk including credit market liquidity model operational compliance reputation and strategic risks the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy capital planning and capital actions the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework which includes review of the erm policy including the risk appetite statement and management and erm reports the risk committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management 

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the board’s 

 

risk committee annually the board reviews and approves the erm policy as well as the risk appetite including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating analyzing and reporting risk information risk review our internal audit function provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness appropriateness and adherence to keycorp’s risk management policies practices and controls 

the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions ensures appropriate ownership of risks provides input into performance and compensation decisions assesses aggregate enterprise risk monitors capabilities to manage critical risks and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline when market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 

we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement these positions are subject to various marketbased risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings are nontrading positions these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions primarily changes in interest rates 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading investing and client facilitation activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

the mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” in this report instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

 

  

  

 var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions historical scenarios 

 

are customized for specific covered positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s risk management group on an annual basis the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var 

we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level for all covered positions was 12 million at december 31 2015 and 9 million at december 31 2014 the increase in aggregate var was primarily due to the increased exposure in our credit derivative portfolio and the composition of our fixed income portfolio figure 32 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 during this period none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits 

figure 32 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

 stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99 confidence level and applying certain assumptions the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 35 million at december 31 2015 and 26 million at december 31 2014 figure 33 summarizes our stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes 

 

figure 33 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

 internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset position which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

 

  

  

  

 net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments including a most likely macroeconomic scenario simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite and boardapproved policy limits 

we measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months and term rates were to move in a similar direction although at a slower pace our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points but due to the low interest rate environment we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 50 basis points over three months with no change over the following nine months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance shifts investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

figure 34 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 at december 31 2015 our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in shortterm or intermediateterm interest rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 in december 2015 the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate which led to an increased modeled exposure to declining interest rates subsequent to the federal reserve’s action in december we increased the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 50 basis points increasing our overall modeled exposure the modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities notably on instruments that are expected to react to the short end of the yield curve as shown in figure 34 we are operating within these levels as of december 31 2015 

 

figure 34 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 the results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 34 net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts the unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates recent balance growth in deposits has caused the uncertainty in assumptions to increase further our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50 and 60 for interestbearing deposits and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling the sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 100 basis point range of modeled results 

key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase modestly prior to any increase in the federal funds rate our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2015 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing 

 

securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 35 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities”

 liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

following our announced acquisition of first niagara in october 2015 sp and fitch affirmed key’s ratings but changed the outlook to negative moody’s placed key’s ratings under review for downgrade the moody’s review could be outstanding beyond the targeted merger completion date 

our credit ratings at december 31 2015 are shown in figure 36 we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 36 credit ratings 

 

 managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and 

 

responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2015 totaled 154 billion consisting of 129 billion of unpledged securities 584 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and 19 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2015 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 189 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 30 billion at the fhlb in 2015 key’s outstanding fhlb advances were reduced by 33 million due to repayments 

final us liquidity coverage ratio 

under the liquidity coverage rules we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key implementation for modified lcr banking organizations like key began on january 1 2016 with a minimum requirement of 90 coverage reaching 100 coverage by january 1 2017 at december 31 2015 our estimated modified lcr was above 100 in the future we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position 

additional information about the liquidity coverage ratio is included in the “supervision and regulation” section under the heading “us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework” in item 1 of this report 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2015 our loantodeposit ratio was 88 which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 18 “longterm debt” that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

on february 12 2015 keybank issued 1 billion of 2250 senior bank notes due march 16 2020 under its global bank note program on june 1 2015 under its global bank note program keybank issued 175 billion of senior bank notes in three tranches 250 million of floating rate notes due june 1 2018 750 

 

million of 1700 senior notes due june 1 2018 and 750 million of 3300 senior notes due june 1 2025 on september 29 2015 we updated the keybank global bank note program this program has 20 billion authorized for issuance separate from the 20 billion authorized under the 2012 program there will be no additional notes issued under the 2012 program 

on may 22 2015 keybank remarketed 300 million of 318 term enhanced remarketable securities senior debt 

on september 15 2015 keycorp issued 1 billion of 290 senior mediumterm notes due september 15 2020 under its mediumterm note program 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2015 keycorp held 27 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2015 keybank paid 1 billion in dividends to keycorp at january 1 2016 keybank had regulatory capacity to pay 553 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 185 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2015 as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 2 million in taxes to be paid we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2015 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 16 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2015 we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was 45 million at december 31 2015 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2015 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 346 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity at december 31 2015 we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2015 the alll was 796 million or 133 of periodend loans compared to 794 million or 138 at december 31 2014 the allowance includes 35 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 308 million at december 31 2015 compared to 40 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 302 million at december 31 2014 for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2015 the alll was 2057 of nonperforming loans compared to 1900 at december 31 2014 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 37 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 37 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

  

  

 we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 

in the third quarter of 2015 we enhanced the approach used to determine the commercial reserve factors used in estimating the quantitative component of the commercial alll in addition we began utilizing an enhanced framework to quantify commercial alll adjustments resulting from qualitative factors not fully captured within the statistical analysis of incurred loss the enhancements of the methodology are described in note 1 “basis of 

 

presentation and accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” as a result of the methodology enhancements the alll within each commercial portfolio and the provision for credit losses within each business segment has increased or decreased accordingly the impact of the increases or decreases on the commercial portfolio alll and the business segment provision for credit losses was not significant 

for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full on at least a quarterly basis we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses the alll at december 31 2015 represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

as shown in figure 38 our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable increasing by 2 million or 3 since 2014 our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit our commercial alll increased by 33 million or 53 since 2014 primarily because of loan growth and increased incurred loss estimates the increase in these incurred loss estimates during 2015 was primarily due to the continued decline in oil and gas prices since 2014 partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in our consumer alll of 31 million or 181 since 2014 our consumer alll decrease was primarily due to continued improvement in credit metrics such as delinquency average credit bureau score and loan to value which have decreased expected loss rates since 2014 the continued improvement in the consumer portfolio credit quality metrics since 2014 was primarily due to continued improved credit quality and benefits of relatively stable economic conditions our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments increased by 21 million to 56 million at december 31 2015 when combined with our alll our total allowance for credit losses represented 142 of periodend loans at december 31 2015 compared to 144 at december 31 2014 

 

figure 38 allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

  

 our provision for credit losses was 166 million for 2015 compared to 57 million for 2014 the increase in our provision is due to the growth in our loan portfolio over the past twelve months as well as lower recoveries in 2015 compared to 2014 we continue to reduce our exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net loan chargeoffs 

asset quality on our oil and gas loan portfolio which represents approximately 2 of total loans at december 31 2015 performed inline with our expectations in 2015 nonperforming loans in this sector increased to 54 of our total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31 2015 up from 09 at december 31 2014 in 2015 net loan chargeoffs in this sector were 81 of our total oil and gas loan portfolio as a result of commodity price declines that began in 2014 our reserve for credit losses allocated to our oil and gas loan exposure was 6 of the total oil and gas loan portfolio at december 31 2015 and reflected the estimated impact of current oil prices at that date 

 

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2015 totaled 142 million or 24 of average loans compared to net loan chargeoffs of 113 million or 20 for the same period last year figure 39 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 40 

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs increased 29 million this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and lower levels of recoveries over the same period as shown in figure 42 our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of 10 million in net loan chargeoffs for 2015 compared to 13 million in net loan chargeoffs for 2014 the decrease in net loan chargeoffs in our exit loan portfolio was primarily driven by lower levels of net loan chargeoffs in our consumer and commercial exit loan portfolios

as shown in figure 41 nonperforming assets decreased during 2015 having declined for the past five years most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our consumer loan portfolio as shown in figure 42 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 23 million or 6 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2015 compared to 41 million or 9 at december 31 2014 

at december 31 2015 the approximate carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 66 of their original contractual amount total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 79 of their contractual amount and total nonperforming assets represented 79 of their original contractual amount at the same date oreo represented 72 of its original contractual amount 

at december 31 2015 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 97 million representing 25 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations compared to 88 million representing 21 in the prior year 

figure 42 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2015 and 2014 the net loan chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of those loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 3 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2015 compared to 4 at december 31 2014 additional information about loan sales is included in the “loans and loans held for sale” section under “loan sales”

 operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee’s oversight of these controls 

 

cybersecurity 

we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients 

fourth quarter results 

figure 45 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2015 are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 224 million or 27 per common share compared to 246 million or 28 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2014 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 97 compared to 112 for the fourth quarter of 2014 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 851 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 950 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 610 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the net interest margin was 287 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 588 million and a net interest margin of 294 for the fourth quarter of 2014 the 22 million increase in net interest margin reflects higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields which also drove the decline in net interest margin 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 485 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 490 million for the yearago quarter the slight decrease from the prior year was predominantly attributable to a decline in net gains from 

 

principal investing of 18 million and 7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market variability these decreases were partially offset by a 12 million increase in other income and growth in some of our other core feebased businesses including 4 million of higher cards and payments income due to higher credit card and merchant fees due to increased volume and a 4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 736 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 during the quarter we incurred mergerrelated costs of 6 million a pension settlement charge of 4 million and costs associated with continuous improvement and efficiency efforts of 10 million these costs impacted both personnel and nonpersonnel expense 

compared to 704 million for the fourth quarter of last year the increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to a 20 million increase in personnel expense related to investments made across the business along with an increase in employee benefits expense nonpersonnel expense increased 12 million most notably from higher business services and professional fees partially due to mergerrelated costs 

provision for credit losses 

our provision for credit losses was 45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 22 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 our alll was 796 million or 133 of total periodend loans at december 31 2015 compared to 794 million or 138 at december 31 2014 

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled 37 million or 25 of average loans compared to 32 million or 22 for the same period last year 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 73 million compared to a tax provision of 94 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 239 compared to 272 for the same quarter one year ago due to additional federal tax credit refunds filed for prior years

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of 

 

others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2015 would indicate the need for a 16 million increase in the allowance the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 44 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 10 million or 01 per common share a 44 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 28 million or 03 per common share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the alll would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in the third quarter of 2015 we enhanced the approach used to determine the commercial reserve factors used in estimating the commercial alll which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the commercial quantitative reserve component that had formerly been included in the commercial qualitative component under the enhanced methodology we began utilizing more refined commercial estimated loss rates that represent cumulative losses over the estimated average time period from the onset of credit deterioration loss to the initial loss recorded for an individual loan in addition we began utilizing an enhanced framework to quantify commercial alll adjustments resulting from qualitative factors that may not be fully captured within the statistical analysis of incurred loss the enhanced framework utilizes the nine qualitative factors recommended within the occ’s interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses issued 12132006 to quantify the commercial qualitative component the impact of these changes was largely neutral to the total alll however because the quantitative reserve is allocated to the business segments at a loan level while the qualitative portion is allocated at the portfolio level the impact of the methodology enhancements on the allowance for each business segment and each portfolio caused the business segment and commercial portfolio reserves to increase or decrease accordingly the impact of the increases and decreases on the business segment and commercial portfolio reserves was not significant 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our 

 

application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2015 159 billion or 17 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2015 12 billion or 1 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

at december 31 2015 7 million or less than 1 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis all of these assets were classified as level 3 at december 31 2015 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 304 million at december 31 2015 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2015 earnings by approximately 30 million 19 million after tax or 02 per common share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 therefore the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a 78 million increase in the goodwill recorded in the key corporate bank unit approximately 72 million of the goodwill was allocated to kbcm in the second quarter of 2015 

 

when pacific crest securities was fully merged into kbcm during the third quarter of 2015 goodwill increased 3 million to account for a tax item associated with the business combination additional information is provided in note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 16 “employee benefits” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2015 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

derivatives and hedging 

we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 20 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2015 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

during 2015 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates except for the alll enhanced methodology discussed above

acquisitions and divestitures 

the information presented in note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global institutions that offer financial services some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures the financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies including nonbank companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

as a bhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval by the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

under federal law a bhc must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress this support may be required when we do not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators 1 the occ for national banks and federal savings associations 2 the fdic for nonmember state banks and savings associations 3 the federal reserve for member state banks 4 the cfpb for consumer financial products or services 5 the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities 6 the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and 7 state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2014 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in 2013 it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

  

regulatory capital and liquidity 

federal banking regulators have promulgated riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to key and keybank consolidated the adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities 

regulatory capital requirements prior to january 1 2015 

at december 31 2014 the minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by federal banking regulators were based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” prior to january 2015 key and keybank consolidated were generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 at least half of the total capital had to be “tier 1 capital” which consists of qualifying perpetual preferred stock common shareholders’ equity excluding aoci other than the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and certain mandatorily convertible preferred securities the remainder could consist of “tier 2 capital” including qualifying subordinated debt certain hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt instruments qualifying perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses bhcs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities exceeding specified levels were required to maintain capital to cover their market risk exposure federal banking regulators also established a minimum leverage ratio requirement for banking organizations the leverage ratio is tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets at december 31 2014 the minimum leverage ratio was 3 for bhcs and national banks that are considered “strong” by the federal reserve or the occ respectively 3 for any bhc that had implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk and 4 for all other bhcs and national banks at december 31 2014 the minimum leverage ratio for key and keybank consolidated was 3 and 4 respectively bhcs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile or growth plans as presented in note 22 “shareholders’ equity” at december 31 2014 key and keybank consolidated had regulatory capital in excess of all applicable minimum riskbased capital including all adjustments for market risk and leverage ratio requirements 

basel iii capital and liquidity frameworks 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework to strengthen international capital regulation of banks and revised it in june 2011 and january 2014 as revised the “basel iii capital framework” the basel iii capital framework requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement and measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress the basel iii capital framework among other things introduces a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” to be included in tier 1 capital with other capital instruments meeting specified requirements a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer the basel iii capital framework is being phasedin over a multiyear period 

in november 2011 the basel committee issued its final rule for a common equity surcharge on certain designated global systemically important banks “gsibs” which was revised in july 2013 as revised “basel gsib framework” under the basel gsib framework a gsib is assessed a progressive 10 to 35 surcharge to the common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer based upon the bank’s systemic importance score in december 2014 the federal reserve published an npr the “us gsib npr” that would implement the basel gsib framework for us gsibs but with expected surcharges ranging from 10 to 45 and would include a new indicator to address the perceived risks of shortterm wholesale funding at december 31 2014 and based on 2013 yearend data there were eight us bhcs none of which included keycorp designated as gsibs under the basel gsib framework in addition the us gsib npr would require each 

  

us toptier bhc with consolidated total assets of at least 50 billion and not a subsidiary of a foreign banking organization such as keycorp to determine annually whether it is a us gsib by using five categories that measure global systemic importance — size interconnectedness substitutability complexity and crossjurisdictional activity comments on the us gsib npr are due by march 2 2015 

the basel committee published its international liquidity standards in 2010 and revised them in january 2013 january 2014 and october 2014 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” it established quantitative standards for liquidity by introducing a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” and a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” 

the basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of the stock of highquality liquid assets “hqlas” divided by total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days must be at least 100 the implementation of basel iii lcr began on january 1 2015 with minimum requirements beginning at 60 rising in annual steps of 10 until full implementation on january 1 2019 

the basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the available amount of stable funding divided by the required amount of stable funding must be at least 100 the basel iii nsfr becomes effective on january 1 2018 

us implementation of the basel iii capital framework 

in october 2013 the federal banking regulators published the final basel iii capital framework for us banking organizations the “regulatory capital rules” which generally implement the basel iii capital framework as described above in the united states under the regulatory capital rules certain large usdomiciled bhcs and banks each an “advanced approaches banking organization” must satisfy minimum qualifying criteria using organizationspecific internal risk measures and management processes for calculating riskbased capital requirements as well as follow certain methodologies to calculate their total riskweighted assets since neither keycorp nor keybank has at least 250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least 10 billion of total onbalance sheet foreign exposure neither keycorp nor keybank is an advanced approaches banking organization instead each of them is a “standardized approach banking organization” 

new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements 

under the regulatory capital rules a standardized approach banking organization like keycorp will be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the table below at december 31 2014 key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 107 under basel iii also at december 31 2014 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios would be as set forth in the table below 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 

 

  

  

  

 revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios 

federal prompt corrective action regulations under the fdia group fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised effective january 1 2015 the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions under the federal banking regulators’ prior prompt corrective action regulations the prior and revised prompt corrective action table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the prior and the revised prompt corrective action rules 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under prior and 

revised prompt corrective action rules 

 

  

  

 we believe that as of december 31 2014 keybank consolidated would have met all revised “well capitalized” prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements under the regulatory capital rules if such requirements had been effective at that time the prompt corrective action regulations however apply only to fdicinsured depository institutions like keybank and not to bhcs like keycorp moreover since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank 

us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework 

in october 2014 the federal banking agencies published the final basel iii liquidity framework for us banking organizations the “liquidity coverage rules” that create a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over 50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp 

keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules unless the occ affirmatively determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of its asset size level of 

 

complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system the lcr and modified lcr created by the liquidity coverage rules are also an enhanced prudential liquidity standard consistent with the doddfrank act 

because keycorp is a modified lcr bhc under the liquidity coverage rules key will be required to maintain its ratio of highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflow amount determined by prescribed assumptions in a standardized hypothetical stress scenario over a 30calendar day period at least at 90 by january 1 2016 and at least at 100 by january 1 2017 throughout december 2014 our estimated modified lcr was approximately in the mid80 range to reach the minimum of 90 by january 1 2016 and to operate with a cushion above the minimum required level we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings calculation of key’s modified lcr is required on a monthly basis unlike on a daily basis for those us banking organizations that are subject to the lcr rather than the modified lcr 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including key’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve capital plan rule and supervisory guidance regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and capital redemptions repurchases including the supervisory expectation in certain circumstances for prior notification to and consultation with federal reserve supervisory staff 

the federal reserve’s annual ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large complex us bhcs and of the policies and practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve assesses the capital plans of these bhcs to ensure that they have both sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of financial and economic stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases 

keycorp filed its 2015 ccar capital plan on january 5 2015 under the federal reserve’s october 2014 ccar instructions and guidance keycorp’s 2015 capital plan was required to reflect the regulatory capital rules including their minimum regulatory capital ratios and transition arrangements as well as key’s tier 1 common ratio for each quarter of the planning horizon using the definitions of tier 1 capital and total riskweighted assets as in effect in 2014 as well as a transition plan for full implementation of the regulatory capital rules 

as part of the annual ccar the federal reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on keycorp as part of this test the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels regulatory capital ratios and the tier 1 common ratio under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined annually by the federal reserve results from the 2015 ccar which will include the annual supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating 31 covered companies including keycorp will be publicly released by the federal reserve the federal reserve has announced that the results from the supervisory stress test and the 2015 ccar will be released on march 5 2015 and march 11 2015 respectively 

keycorp and keybank must also conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one 

 

keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined one stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank must only conduct an annual stress test keycorp must conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and occ in early january of each year keycorp is required to report the results of its 2015 midcycle stress test to the federal reserve during the period of july 5 2015 to august 4 2015 inclusive summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests are disclosed each year under the “regulatory disclosure” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

dividend restrictions 

federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be in a less than “adequately capitalized” prompt corrective action capital category or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits is 250000 per depository 

the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository intuition’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorp’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind up a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually by december 31 of each year for 2014 keycorp and keybank elected to submit a joint resolution plan given key’s organizational structure and business activities and the significance of keybank to key this resolution plan the second required from keycorp and keybank was submitted on december 2 

  

2014 in january 2015 the federal reserve and fdic made available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans in december 2014 the public section of the joint resolution plan of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegresolutionplanshtm 

financial stability oversight council 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc a systemic risk oversight body to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key for compliance with federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to key’s consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

debit card interchange 

federal reserve regulation ii — debit card interchange fees and routing the “interchange fee rule” — limits debit card interchange fees and eliminates exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions the relevant portions of the interchange fee rule became effective october 1 2011 the interchange fee rule allows debit card issuers to recover from merchants an interchange fee of 21 per transaction a fee of five basis points of the value of the transaction and an additional 01 fraud prevention adjustment retail merchants and merchant groups filed suit to challenge the interchange fee rule their challenge was unsuccessful 

“volcker rule” 

in december 2013 federal banking regulators issued a joint final rule the “final rule” implementing section 619 of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” the final rule prohibits “banking entities” 

  

such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the final rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers banking entities may also engage in riskmitigating hedges if the entity can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the final rule 

although the final rule became effective on april 1 2014 on december 18 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2016 with respect to covered funds the federal reserve further indicated its intent to grant an additional oneyear extension of the compliance deadline until july 21 2017 and indicated it would reevaluate its rules relating to the process by which banking entities would be able to apply for further fiveyear extensions key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the final rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading “other investments” in item 7 of this report 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs like keycorp with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits “sccl” supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures 

the stress test requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a final rule adopted by the federal reserve in 2012 the resolution plan requirements applicable to keycorp were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in 2011 

in march 2014 the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of these required enhanced prudential standards the enhanced prudential standards implemented by this final rule were i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserve’s previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits monitoring liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing and a liquidity buffer iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management including the requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a “grave threat” to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january 1 2015 

 

the sccl and the early remediation requirements published in january 2012 by the federal reserve as a proposed rule however were not included as part of the march 2014 final rule the federal reserve has indicated that is conducting a quantitative impact study and will take into account the basel committee’s april 2014 large exposures regime before finalizing the sccl it is unclear when the federal reserve will finalize the early remediation requirements no credit exposure reporting requirements which must be implemented jointly by the federal reserve and fdic have yet been proposed the federal reserve has indicated that both the federal reserve and fdic recognize that such reports would be most useful and complete if developed in conjunction with the sccl 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc certain of the victory mutual funds with which we continue to have a relationship and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

new assessments fees and other charges 

certain provisions of the doddfrank act require or authorize certain us governmental departments agencies and instrumentalities to collect new or higher assessments fees and other charges from bhcs and banks like keycorp and keybank the us treasury has established an assessment schedule to collect from sifis including keycorp based on their average total consolidated assets semiannual assessments to pay the expenses of the ofr including the expenses of the fsoc and certain expenses for implementing the orderly liquidation activities of the fdic the federal reserve has established an annual assessment upon sifis including keycorp based on their average total consolidated assets for the federal reserve’s examination supervision and regulation of such companies the occ has changed its semiannual assessment upon large national banks like keybank to reflect its doddfrank act authority to do so 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

  

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk capital and liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the us economy remains vulnerable and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the recovery in commercial real estate the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents has continued to lag behind the overall economy these economic factors generally affect certain industries like real estate and financial services more significantly a significant portion of our clients are active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans 

a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases which may also lead to existing lease turnover 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may recommend an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may recommend an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

  

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing the widespread liquidation of assets and constraining the credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial financial and agricultural loans 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 72 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile that includes among other risks a borrower’s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which would result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

ii compliance risk 

we are subject to extensive and increasing government regulation and supervision 

as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

we face increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide financial market stability and enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions we expect continued intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly due to keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions under the doddfrank act’s heightened prudential standards and regulations we also face increased regulation from efforts designed to protect consumers from financial abuse although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts continue to be implemented as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act 

changes to existing statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and becoming subject to additional heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

  

changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 

the fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

iii operational risk 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on 

  

our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators in 2013 related to how banks select engage and manage their outside vendors may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

we are subject to operational risk 

we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

  

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon our customers such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

iv capital and liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and higher quality loweryielding liquid assets than has historically been the case 

new and evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the new capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january 1 2015 see the section titled “regulatory capital and liquidity” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the federal reserve’s new capital standards will require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 

in addition the new liquidity standards will require us to increase our holdings of higherquality loweryielding liquid assets may require us to change our mix of investment alternatives and may impact business relationships with certain customers they could reduce our ability to invest in longerterm assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective 

in addition the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bank holding companies should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment in light of recent moderate improvements in the us economy federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have a negative impact perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields which could have a chilling effect on borrowing in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize a troubled economy 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our equity securities 

  

and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level of or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed conditions 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the doddfrank act we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

v market risk 

a reversal of the us economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry additionally the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for key and affected our business and financial performance the lowinterest rate environment may persist for some time even as the economy continues to improve and may continue to have a negative impact on our performance 

in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income 

our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “risk management — management of interest risk exposure” found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments with which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — pacific rocky mountains indiana west ohiomichigan east ohio western new york eastern new york and new england — and potential exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery has been experienced unevenly in the various regions where we operate and continued improvement in the overall us economy may not result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

  

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated with the real estate health care and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce and embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace acquiring and expanding customer relationships including by “crossselling” additional or new products to them is also very important to our business model and our ability to grow revenue and earnings our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

  

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks mergers and acquisitions have led to increased concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers maintaining our high ethical standards and safe and sound assets and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry and our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices including smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

  

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the federal reserve who may identify deficiencies in the structure causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company diversion of our management’s time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms our inability to realize anticipated revenue and cost benefits and synergies increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction additionally if an acquisition or strategic partnership were to occur we may fail to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence or other projected benefits 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management and capital planning functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

 economic overview 

the economy continued its modest recovery in 2014 with overall gdp starting slowly and accelerating as the year progressed resulting in 24 growth the year began with gdp contracting 21 in the first quarter due to extreme weather halting consumer spending and investment in the second quarter growth of 46 more than reversed the first quarter’s decline pentup consumer demand was the largest contributor to the growth as the impact of extreme weather conditions in the first quarter faded in the third quarter growth accelerated as consumers spent money saved at the gas pump oil prices dropped 46 over the last half of the year giving consumers a boost in discretionary income the fourth quarter saw growth slow to 26 as consumer spending continued to be a bright spot the stock market continued its climb in 2014 with the sp 500 equity index increasing 11 compared to a 30 increase in 2013 globally the economic recovery slowed central banks in developed nations maintained easy money policies in europe the recovery stalled and the risk of deflation rose leading the european central bank to consider further action emerging markets struggled as well — demand decreased exports dropped and china grew at its slowest rate in 24 years 

for 2014 295 million new jobs were added in the us the unemployment rate fell further from 697 at december 31 2013 to 570 at december 31 2014 while job growth was a factor the majority of the improvement was driven by a decrease in the labor force participation rate which declined to its lowest level in over 35 years wage growth deteriorated through much of the year and income growth was weak indicative of slack in the labor market however consumer spending held up reasonably well resulting in a falling savings rate a slowing rate of inflation supported real incomes and therefore spending throughout the year by december 2014 headline inflation was down to 8 compared to 15 one year ago mainly due to the decline in fuel prices core inflation also remained low throughout the year ending 2014 at 16 down from 17 in 2013 

as the economy expanded further and job growth accelerated the housing market gained traction with slight improvement across nearly all metrics in 2014 slow household formation continues to be a factor however and sales growth remains relatively modest existing home sales finished 2014 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504 million up slightly from december 2013 new home sales ended the year on a solid note reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481000 in december 2014 up 88 from 2013 the pace of price appreciation slowed with the median price for existing homes up 55 yearoveryear in november 2014 compared to 99 in 2013 housing starts accelerated further up 9 over 2013 driven primarily by substantial gains in both single and multifamily construction 

the federal reserve remained active and accommodative in 2014 keeping the federal funds target rate near zero expanding its balance sheet further and making significant changes to its communications janet yellen replaced ben bernanke as the federal reserve chairman in february 2014 the federal reserve started tapering the pace of asset purchases by 10 billion from 85 billion per month to 75 billion per month in january and concluded purchasing securities in october however the federal open market committee “fomc” decided to maintain the existing policy of reinvesting principal payments to help accommodate financial conditions in addition the federal reserve kept its forward guidance unchanged in december explicitly stating that the federal funds rate will be kept near zero for a considerable time low inflation remains a concern the fmoc acknowledged lower energy prices were a factor in holding inflation under their longerrun objective of 20 the 10year us treasury yield began the year at 30 and was rangebound from 27 to 29 for the first quarter of the year driven by disappointing weatherrelated economic data around the year’s halfway point with rising concerns over global growth the 10year us treasury yield began to decrease approaching 20 by the end of the year as the stock market continued to rally 

 

longterm financial goals 

our longterm financial goals are as follows

 corporate strategy 

we remain committed to enhancing longterm shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model growing our franchise and being disciplined in our management of capital our 20142015 strategic focus is to add new clients and to expand our relationships with existing clients we intend to pursue this strategy by continuing to control and reduce expenses being more productive from the front office to the back office effectively balancing risk and rewards within our moderate risk profile and engaging retaining and inspiring our diverse and high performing workforce our strategic priorities for enhancing longterm shareholder value are described below 

 

  

  

  

  

 strategic developments 

we initiated the following actions during 2014 to support our corporate strategy 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 highlights of our 2014 performance 

financial performance 

for 2014 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 917 million or 104 per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 847 million or 93 per common share for 2013 

figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years 

figure 3 results of operations 

 

  

  

 our 2014 fullyear results reflect success in executing our strategy by generating positive operating leverage and maintaining strong risk management and disciplined capital management we continued to invest in our businesses to accelerate growth during the third quarter of 2014 we acquired pacific crest securities a leading technologyfocused investment bank and capital markets firm we added bankers across our franchise expanded our payment capabilities and enhanced technology in areas such as mobile online and cyber security in addition as part of our actions to drive efficiency we closed 34 branches and exited nonstrategic assets that were not consistent with our relationship strategy such as international leasing we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage and delivering on our longterm goal of achieving a cash efficiency ratio below 60 

our taxableequivalent net interest income for 2014 was 23 billion and the net interest margin was 297 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 23 billion and a net interest margin of 312 for the prior year the decreases in net interest income which declined 31 million and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields these decreases were partially offset by loan growth the maturity of higherrate certificates of deposit and a more favorable mix of lowercost deposits in 2015 we expect net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from anticipated higher rates with net interest income growth in the low to midsingledigit percentage range compared to 2014 and net interest margin to be stable to slightly higher later in 2015 

 

our noninterest income was 18 billion up 31 million or 18 from 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year increasing 64 million from 2013 net gains losses from principal investing were 26 million higher than prior year and trust and investment services income increased 10 million these increases were partially offset by declines of 21 million in operating lease income and other leasing 20 million in service charges on deposits accounts 12 million in mortgage servicing fees and 9 million in consumer mortgage income other income also decreased 15 million in 2015 we expect midsingledigit growth compared to 2014 including the fullyear impact of the recentlyacquired pacific crest securities 

our noninterest expense was 28 billion a decrease of 61 million or 22 from 2013 we recognized 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2014 compared to 117 million in 2013 personnel expense declined 18 million driven by lower net technology contract labor severance and employee benefits partially offset by higher incentive compensation and stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 43 million primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs of 14 million provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments of 10 million and equipment expense of 8 million in 2015 we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable with 2014 

average loans totaled 557 billion for 2014 compared to 531 billion in 2013 commercial financial and agricultural loan growth of 27 billion from the prior year was broadbased across our commercial lines of business consumer loans remained relatively stable as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio primarily home equity loans and direct term loans were mostly offset by runoff in our designated consumer exit portfolio for 2015 we anticipate average loans growth in the midsingledigit range benefiting from the strength in our commercial businesses 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 673 billion for 2014 an increase of 19 billion compared to 2013 demand deposits and now and money market deposit accounts each increased 14 billion mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business these increases were partially offset by runoff in certificates of deposit our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 846 at december 31 2014 compared to 838 at december 31 2013 

our asset quality statistics continued to improve during 2014 the provision for loan and lease losses was 59 million for 2014 compared to 130 million for 2013 net loan chargeoffs declined to 113 million or 20 of average loan balances for 2014 compared to 168 million or 32 for 2013 in addition our nonperforming loans declined to 418 million or 73 of periodend loans at december 31 2014 compared to 508 million or 93 at december 31 2013 our alll was 794 million or 138 of periodend loans compared to 848 million or 156 at december 31 2013 and represented 190 and 1669 coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively in 2015 we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans to remain below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points and the provision for loan and lease losses to approximate net loan chargeoffs 

our tangible common equity ratio and tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at december 31 2014 at 988 and 1117 respectively compared to 980 and 1122 respectively at december 31 2013 we have identified four primary uses of capital 

 

  

  

  

 our capital management remains focused on creating value during 2014 we announced an 18 increase in the common share dividend and repurchased 496 million of common shares resulting in a peerleading shareholder payout of approximately 82 of our 2014 net income 

  

the federal reserve is currently reviewing of our 2015 capital plan under the ccar process until such time as it has completed its review and has no objection to our plan we are not permitted to implement our capital plan for periods after the first quarter of 2015 should we receive an objection to our plan it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year for more information about the ccar process see “capital planning and stress testing” under “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

figure 4 presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible common equity” “tier 1 common equity” “preprovision net revenue” “cash efficiency ratio” and “common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules estimates” 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock tier 1 common equity a nongaap financial measure is a component of tier 1 riskbased capital tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before january 1 2015 however since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations the federal reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories the regulatory capital rules described in more detail under the section “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report also make tier 1 common equity a priority the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by among other changes phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital by 2016 our trust preferred securities will only be included in tier 2 capital 

figure 4 also shows the computation for preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation we believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

 results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing taxableequivalent net interest income by average earning assets 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2014 was 2317 billion and the net interest margin was 297 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2348 billion and a net interest margin of 312 for the prior year the decreases in net interest income which declined 31 million and the net interest margin were attributable to lower earning asset yields these decreases were partially offset by loan growth the maturity of higherrate certificates of deposit and a more favorable mix of lowercost deposits and wholesale borrowings 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2013 increased 60 million compared to 2012 due to an increase in average loans a more favorable funding mix and higher loan fees partially offset by lower earning asset yields the net interest margin declined nine basis points primarily resulting from lower earning asset yields which were partially offset by a more favorable funding mix 

average earning assets totaled 781 billion for 2014 compared to 754 billion in 2013 commercial financial and agricultural loan growth of 27 billion from the prior year was broadbased across our commercial lines of business consumer loans remained relatively stable as modest increases across our core consumer loan portfolio primarily home equity loans and direct term loans were mostly offset by runoff in our designated consumer exit portfolio 

average deposits excluding deposits in foreign office totaled 673 billion for 2014 an increase of 19 billion compared to 2013 demand deposits and now and money market deposit accounts each increased 14 billion mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business these increases were partially offset by runoff in certificates of deposit

 noninterest income 

as shown in figure 7 noninterest income for 2014 was 18 billion up 31 million or 18 from 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees benefited from our business model and had a record high year increasing 64 million from 2013 net gains losses from principal investing were 26 million higher than prior year and trust and investment services income increased 10 million primarily due to the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities these increases were partially offset by declines of 21 million in operating lease income and other leasing 20 million in service charges on deposits accounts 12 million in mortgage servicing fees and 9 million in consumer mortgage income other income also decreased 15 million 

in 2013 noninterest income decreased 90 million or 48 compared to 2012 operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased 84 million primarily due to fewer early terminations in the leveraged lease portfolio consumer mortgage income declined 21 million and net gains losses from principal investing decreased 20 million other income also declined 46 million primarily due to gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by increases of 34 million in mortgage servicing fees 27 million in cards and payments income and 18 million in trust and investment services income

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 9 for 2014 trust and investment services income increased 10 million or 25 from the prior year primarily due to the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities for 2013 trust and investment services income increased 18 million or 48 from the prior year 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2014 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 392 billion compared to 369 billion at december 31 2013 and 347 billion at december 31 2012 as shown in figure 9 increases across all portfolios were primarily attributable to market appreciation 

  

figure 9 assets under management 

 

 investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees for 2014 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 64 million or 192 from the prior year for 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 6 million or 18 these increases reflect the benefits of our business model — focusing on targeted industries — including the addition of the technology sector with the 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities 

service charges on deposit accounts 

service charges on deposit accounts declined 20 million or 71 in 2014 compared to the prior year and 6 million or 21 in 2013 compared to the prior year due to lower maintenance fees and overdraft charges 

operating lease income and other leasing gains 

operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased 21 million or 179 during 2014 compared to the prior year and 84 million or 418 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower gains on the early terminations of leveraged leases product runoff also contributed to the declines between years accordingly as shown in figure 10 operating lease expense related to the rental of leased equipment also declined between years 

corporate services income 

corporate services income increased 6 million or 35 in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by higher nonyield loan fees and 4 million or 24 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in letter of credit fees 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 4 million or 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 credit card fees were higher due to growth in both rate and volume while increased merchant fees were driven by volume cards and payments income increased 27 million or 20 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition 

consumer mortgage income 

consumer mortgage income declined 9 million or 474 in 2014 compared to 2013 and 21 million or 525 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower mortgage originations caused by increasing mortgage interest rates 

mortgage servicing fees 

mortgage servicing fees decreased 12 million or 207 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower special servicing fees mortgage servicing fees increased 34 million or 1417 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher levels of core servicing and special servicing fees as a result of the 2013 acquisition of a commercial mortgage servicing portfolio 

  

other income 

other income which consists primarily of gain on sale of certain loans other service charges and certain dealer trading income decreased 15 million or 254 in 2014 compared to 2013 and 46 million or 438 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to declines in various miscellaneous income categories 

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 10 noninterest expense for 2014 was 28 billion a decrease of 61 million or 22 from 2013 we recognized 80 million of efficiency and pensionrelated charges in 2014 compared to 117 million in 2013 we also recognized 22 million of noninterest expense related to pacific crest securities which we acquired in the third quarter of 2014 as shown in figure 11 personnel expense declined 18 million driven by lower net technology contract labor severance and employee benefits partially offset by higher incentive compensation and stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 43 million primarily due to declines in net occupancy costs of 14 million provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments of 10 million and equipment expense of 8 million 

noninterest expense for 2013 was 28 billion up 2 million or 1 from 2012 in 2013 expenses attributable to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolios and western new york branches increased 40 million and we recognized 117 million of expenses related to our efficiency initiative and a pension settlement charge as shown in figure 11 personnel expense increased by 39 million in 2013 driven by higher levels of incentive compensation employee benefits and severance expense partially offset by a decline in stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 37 million primarily due to declines in several expense categories 39 million in business services and professional fees 17 million in marketing 11 million in other expense and 10 million in operating lease expense these declines in nonpersonnel expense were partially offset by increases of 24 million in provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 21 in intangible asset amortization and 15 million in net occupancy costs 

figure 10 noninterest expense 

 

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 11 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense decreased by 18 million or 11 in 2014 compared to 2013 declines in net technology contract labor of 17 million severance 

 

of 14 million and employee benefits of 12 million all contributed to the decrease in personnel expense these declines were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation of 19 million and stockbased compensation of 9 million related to the performance of our business and the third quarter 2014 acquisition of pacific crest securities 

personnel expense increased by 39 million or 25 from 2012 to 2013 incentive compensation increased 28 million severance expense and employee benefits increased 15 million and 12 million respectively as a result of staff reductions related to our efficiency initiative employee benefits included a 27 million pension settlement charge these increases in personnel expense were partially offset by a decrease of 14 million in stockbased compensation 

figure 11 personnel expense 

 

  

 operating lease expense 

operating lease expense decreased 5 million or 106 in 2014 compared to 2013 and 10 million or 175 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains” 

intangible asset amortization 

intangible asset amortization decreased 5 million or 114 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated basis of amortization for the core deposit and pccr intangibles intangible asset amortization increased 21 million or 913 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and western new york branches additional information regarding our intangible assets can be found in note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

other expense 

other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items such as travel and entertainment technology service providers and franchise and business taxes other expense declined 4 million or 12 in 2014 compared to 2013 and 11 million or 32 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to fluctuations in several of those line items 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 326 million for 2014 compared to a tax provision of 271 million for 2013 and 231 million for 2012 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 256 for 2014 compared to 237 for 2013 and 214 for 2012 

 

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves in 2014 our effective tax rate was positively impacted by a settlement with the irs on tax refund claims for prior years partially offset by the writeoff of a foreign deferred tax asset due to the sale of certain foreign leasing assets in addition in 2014 2013 and 2012 our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs 

we recorded a valuation allowance of 3 million at december 31 2014 compared to 1 million at december 31 2013 and 3 million at december 31 2012 against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards

 key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 13 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 234 million for 2014 compared to 205 million for 2013 and 162 million for 2012 the increase in 2014 was primarily due to a reduced provision for loan and lease losses and lower noninterest expense 

 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined 84 million or 55 from 2013 average loans and leases grew 794 million while average deposits increased 521 million compared to 2013 the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was more than offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2014 compared to one year ago 

noninterest income decreased 15 million or 19 from 2013 service charges on deposit accounts declined 19 million from 2013 primarily due to reduced overdraft fees resulting from changes in posting order consumer mortgage income decreased 9 million from 2013 due to lower refinancing activity and operating leasing income and other leasing gains declined 4 million these decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by an 8 million increase in cards and payments income and a 9 million increase in other miscellaneous income 

the provision for loan and lease losses declined 81 million or 523 from 2013 net loan chargeoffs decreased 31 million from 2013 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio 

noninterest expense declined 65 million or 35 from 2013 personnel expense decreased 26 million primarily due to declines in salaries incentive compensation and employee benefits nonpersonnel expense declined 39 million primarily due to decreases in outside loan servicing fees computer processing intangible asset amortization and other support costs 

in 2013 key community bank’s net income attributable to key increased 43 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income declined 5 million from 2012 the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2013 driven by the prolonged low rate environment noninterest income increased 13 million from 2012 trust and investment services income increased due to higher assets under management resulting from market appreciation and increased production cards and payments income increased due to the fullyear impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition in 2012 these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a decline in consumer mortgage income primarily due to lower originations the provision for loan and lease losses increased 5 million noninterest expense declined 65 million from 2012 due to key’s efficiency initiative personnel expense decreased primarily due to declines in salaries and employee benefits nonpersonnel expense declined primarily due to decreases in business services and professional fees computer processing and other support costs

 key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14 key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 497 million for 2014 compared to 475 million for 2013 and 425 million for 2012 the 2014 increase was driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense 

taxableequivalent net interest income increased 45 million or 57 in 2014 compared to 2013 the growth was primarily driven by a 28 million increase in the earning asset spread as the increase in earning asset balances more than offset the decrease in the spread rate yearoveryear in addition there were increases in other components of net interest income 

noninterest income increased 49 million or 65 from 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 63 million driven by the strength of key’s business model corporate services income increased 11 million due to growth in nonyield loan fees associated with increases in loans trust and investment services income increased 8 million due to the recentlyacquired pacific crest securities these increases were partially offset by a 17 million decrease in other noninterest income mostly due to lower gains realized on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and a 12 million decline in mortgage servicing fees due to lower special servicing fees 

the provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of 2 million in 2014 compared to a credit of 3 million in 2013 the 2014 credit was driven by continued improvement in credit quality within the portfolio as the quality of new business volume exceeded that of the legacy portfolio net loan chargeoffs decreased from 3 million in 2013 to a 19 million recovery in 2014 

noninterest expense increased 49 million or 61 from 2013 this increase was primarily driven by a 38 million increase in personnel expense due to higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance 

 

of the key corporate bank and the impact of the recentlyacquired pacific crest securities in addition there were increases in various other expense categories 

in 2013 key corporate bank’s net income attributable to key increased 50 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 as increases in earning asset spread from higher earning asset balances offset a decrease in deposit spread from a decline in rates noninterest income increased 33 million as increases in mortgage servicing fees gains realized on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and investment banking and debt placement fees more than offset decreases in operating lease income and other leasing gains the provision for loan and lease losses decreased 33 million due to improved credit quality with the portfolio noninterest expense increased 6 million driven by higher provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments and personnel expense these expense increases were partially offset by decreases in operating lease expense and net oreo expense

other segments consist of corporate treasury community development our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios other segments generated net income attributable to key of 226 million for 2014 compared to 220 million for 2013 and 204 million for 2012 taxableequivalent net interest income and noninterest income both increased 4 million compared to 2013 noninterest expense declined 17 million from the prior year these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of 10 million 

in 2013 other segments’ net income attributable to key increased 16 million from the prior year taxableequivalent net interest income increased 68 million the provision for loan and lease losses declined 74 million and noninterest expense decreased 34 million these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income of 158 million

 at december 31 2014 total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 574 billion compared to 545 billion at the end of 2013 and 528 billion at the end of 2012 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 23 billion at december 31 2014 45 billion at december 31 2013 and 52 billion at december 31 2012 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 414 billion at december 31 2014 an increase of 31 billion or 8 compared to december 31 2013 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 15 our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represent 49 and 46 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and are the largest component of our total loans the loans consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans increased 3 billion or 121 from one year ago 

figure 16 provides our commercial financial and agricultural loans by industry classification as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

figure 16 commercial financial and agricultural loans 

 

 commercial financial and agricultural loans increased 3 billion or 121 from the same period last year with key corporate bank increasing 27 billion and key community bank up 553 million we have experienced 

  

growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and institutional and capital markets business our two largest industry classifications — services and manufacturing — increased by 3 and 9 respectively when compared to one year ago the services and manufacturing industries represented 22 and 17 respectively of the total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31 2014 and 24 and 17 respectively at december 31 2013 at the end of each period provided in figure 16 above loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for approximately 40 of our total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio 

services manufacturing and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge our loans in the services classification grew by 17 million or 3 compared to last year loans in the manufacturing classification grew by 383 million or 9 compared to the same period one year ago increases in lending to large corporate middle market and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification 

our loans in the financial services and transportation classifications increased 32 and 48 respectively compared to the prior year the increase in financial services loans was primarily attributable to higher issuances of revolving facilities to finance companies and additional reit balances the increase in transportation loans was primarily attributable to loan growth for rail cars and shipping containers 

our oil and gas loan portfolio focuses on lending to middle market companies and represents 2 of total loans outstanding at december 31 2014 we have over 10 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to oil and gas credit quality on these loans remains solid 

commercial real estate loans cre loans represent 16 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 these cre loans including both owner and nonowneroccupied properties represented 22 of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31 2014 compared to 23 one year ago these loans have increased 334 million or 38 to 91 billion at december 31 2014 from 88 billion at december 31 2013 our cre lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 12state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of cre located both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 61 of our average yeartodate cre loans compared to 56 one year ago keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of cre 

figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as shown in figure 17 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral 

as presented in figure 17 at december 31 2014 our cre portfolio included mortgage loans of 8 billion and construction loans of 11 billion representing 14 and 2 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represented 11 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represented 5 of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2014 was 49 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2014 had a balance of 105 million at december 31 2014 our average construction loan commitment was 59 million our largest construction loan commitment was 498 million and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was 422 million 

also shown in figure 17 at december 31 2014 70 of our cre loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 67 at december 31 2013 approximately 15 and 16 of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments a significant decline in economic growth and in turn in rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans 

  

figure 17 commercial real estate loans 

 

  

 during 2014 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 2 million from 23 million at december 31 2013 to 21 million at december 31 2014 as a result of continued improvement in asset quality and market conditions this category of loans declined by 104 million during 2013 

since december 31 2013 our nonowneroccupied cre portfolio has increased by approximately 567 million or 97 as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 

if the economic recovery stalls it may weaken the cre market fundamentals ie vacancy rates the stability of rental income and asset values leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments accordingly the value of cre loan portfolio could be adversely affected 

commercial lease financing we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our kef line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 10 of commercial loans at december 31 2014 and 12 at december 31 2013 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not 

  

experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions forgiveness of principal and other modifications loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr during 2014 there were 22 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to 69 million of new restructured commercial loans in 2013 

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 5 “asset quality” 

figure 18 commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status 

 

 we often use an ab note structure for our tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches first we create an a note since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in longterm markets and “takeout underwriting standards” of our various lines of business appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification moreover the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically cre the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction and local markets are spared distressedfire sales 

the b note typically is an interestonly note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the a note we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current welldocumented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under 

  

the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we wait a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

all loans processed as tdrs including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 

additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 5 “asset quality” 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but sometimes they are modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for both the client and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal pay down increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 

we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the highlevel objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and nearterm debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

  

as of december 31 2014 we had 34 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 and were accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding decreased by 130 million or 8 from one year ago the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 97 of this portfolio at december 31 2014 originated from key community bank within our 12state footprint the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans in key community bank increased by 26 million or 3 over the past 12 months as a result of stabilized home values improved employment and favorable borrowing conditions 

as shown in figure 13 we hold the first lien position for approximately 60 of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2014 and 58 at december 31 2013 for consumer loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratio this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively and therefore prior periods were not adjusted at december 31 2014 40 of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages on at least a quarterly basis we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate

loans held for sale 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale were 734 million at december 31 2014 compared to 611 million at december 31 2013 during 2014 we recorded net gains losses from loan sales of 97 million there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31 2014 and 2013

loan sales 

as shown in figure 20 during 2014 we sold 44 billion of cre loans 407 million of residential real estate loans and 376 million of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio

 in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 14 billion of the 194 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2014 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of cre loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets”

our securities portfolio totaled 184 billion at december 31 2014 compared to 171 billion at december 31 2013 availableforsale securities were 134 billion at december 31 2014 compared to 123 billion at december 31 2013 heldtomaturity securities were 5 billion at december 31 2014 compared to 48 billion at december 31 2013 

as shown in figure 23 all of our mortgagebacked securities which include both securities available for sale and heldtomaturity securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in liquid secondary markets these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the availableforsale portfolio and at cost for the heldtomaturity portfolio for more information about these securities see note 6 “fair value measurements” under the heading “qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques” and note 7 “securities”

 securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgagebacked securities cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities these mortgage securities generate interest income serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements and provide liquidity value under upcoming regulatory requirements at december 31 2014 we had 133 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 123 billion at december 31 2013 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

throughout 2013 and 2014 our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities at other times we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position andor interest rate risk management strategies may require lastly our focus on investing in gnmarelated securities is also related to liquidity management strategies as we continue to make progress in preparing for future regulatory requirements

other investments 

principal investments — investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 53 of other investments at december 31 2014 they include direct investments investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value the fair value of the direct investments was 104 million at december 31 2014 and 141 million at december 31 2013 while the fair value of the indirect investments was 302 million at december 31 2014 and 413 million at december 31 2013 under the requirements of the volcker rule we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments on december 18 2014 the federal reserve extended the conformance period to july 21 2016 for all banking entities with respect to covered funds the federal reserve also indicated its intent to exercise the authority granted by section 13 of the bank holding company act to grant the final oneyear extension until july 21 2017 if this authority is not exercised by the federal reserve key is permitted to file for a oneyear extension and an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time we plan to apply for the extension if not granted automatically and hold the investments as of december 31 2014 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments for more information about the volcker rule see the discussion under the heading “other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act — ‘volcker rule’” in the section entitled “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain realestaterelated investments that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost there are indirect realestaterelated investments valued at 10 million at december 31 2014 and 23 million at december 31 2013 that may be subject to the disposal requirements under the volcker rule as described in the previous paragraph 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information this review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry thirdparty data and other relevant factors as of december 31 2014 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 78 million which includes 13 million of net unrealized losses these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

deposits and other sources of funds 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding during 2014 average domestic deposits were 673 billion and represented 86 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 653 billion and 87 during 2013 the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled “net interest income” 

the increase in average domestic deposits from 2013 to 2014 was due to increases in demand deposits of 14 billion and now and money market deposit accounts of 14 billion these increases were mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business this growth was partially offset by runoff in certificates of deposit 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 24 billion during 2014 compared to 28 billion during 2013 the change from 2013 was caused by a 620 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a 48 million increase in foreign office deposits and a 203 million increase in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings 

 

at december 31 2014 key had 26 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

 capital 

at december 31 2014 our shareholders’ equity was 105 billion up 227 million from december 31 2013 the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity 

ccar and capital actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhc’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions in january 2014 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2014 capital plan under the annual ccar process on march 26 2014 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2014 capital plan the 2014 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to 542 million share repurchases under the capital plan began in the second quarter of 2014 and include repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans common share repurchases under the 2014 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2015 

through the fourth quarter of 2014 we repurchased 355 million of common shares under our 2014 capital plan authorization during the first quarter of 2014 we completed 141 million of common shares under our 2013 capital plan authorization 

dividends 

as previously reported our 2014 capital plan also proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from 055 to 065 per share which was approved by our board of directors in may 2014 other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board based upon our earnings financial condition and other factors including regulatory review further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “regulatory capital and liquidity” 

consistent with the 2014 capital plan we made a dividend payment of 065 per share on our common shares during each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2014 totaling 169 million and a dividend payment of 055 per share or 49 million during the first quarter of 2014 

we also made four quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share totaling 22 million on our series a preferred stock during 2014 

 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 28673 holders of record at december 31 2014 our book value per common share was 1191 based on 8594 million shares outstanding at december 31 2014 compared to 1125 based on 8907 million shares outstanding at december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 our tangible book value per common share was 1065 compared to 1011 at december 31 2013 

figure 45 in the section entitled “fourth quarter results” shows the market price ranges of our common shares per common share earnings and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years 

figure 27 compares the price performance of our common shares based on an initial investment of 100 on december 31 2009 and assuming reinvestment of dividends with that of the standard  poor’s 500 index and a group of other banks that constitute our peer group the peer group consists of the banks that make up the standard  poor’s 500 regional bank index and the banks that make up the standard  poor’s 500 diversified bank index we are included in the standard  poor’s 500 index and the peer group

 at december 31 2014 we had 1576 million treasury shares compared to 1262 million treasury shares at december 31 2013 during 2014 common shares outstanding decreased by 31 million shares from share repurchases under our 2013 and 2014 capital plans and the net activity in our employee benefit plans going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

  

as discussed in further detail in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report under the heading “capital planning and stress testing” we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year subject to the federal reserve’s notice of nonobjection pursuant to that requirement we have submitted to the federal reserve for review our 2015 capital plan 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2014 our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1122 at december 31 2014 compared to 1109 at december 31 2013 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 988 at december 31 2014 compared to 980 at december 31 2013 

federal banking regulators have promulgated minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements for bhcs like keycorp and their banking subsidiaries like keybank prior to january 1 2015 key and keybank consolidated were each required to maintain a minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 400 and a total riskbased capital ratio of 800 while key was required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 300 and keybank consolidated was required to maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 400 at december 31 2014 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio total riskbased capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio were 1190 1389 and 1126 respectively compared to 1196 1433 and 1111 respectively at december 31 2013 

the adoption of the regulatory capital rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital the phaseout period which began january 1 2015 for standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital by 2016 the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute 339 million or 40 38 and 39 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 1190 tier 1 leverage ratio of 1126 and total riskbased capital ratio of 1389 respectively at december 31 2014 the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of key at december 31 2014 calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “new minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

as previously indicated in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios” the prompt corrective action capital category regulations do not apply to bhcs if however these regulations did apply to bhcs we believe keycorp would qualify for the “well capitalized” capital category at december 31 2014 moreover after accounting for the phaseout of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible and therefore as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2014 we estimate keycorp would still qualify for the “well capitalized” capital category under the regulatory capital regulations in effect before january 1 2015 with an estimated tier 1 riskbased capital ratio estimated tier 1 leverage ratio and estimated total riskbased capital ratio of 1150 1088 and 1389 respectively the new threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the regulatory capital rules are described in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “revised prompt corrective action capital category ratios” since the regulatory capital categories under these regulations serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “regulatory capital and liquidity” in “supervision and regulation” under item 1 of this report 

 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations the federal reserve’s assessment of capital adequacy focuses on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies including keycorp the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks and bhcs tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount prior to january 1 2015 by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4 in the “highlights of our 2014 performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to tier 1 common equity the corresponding nongaap measure our tier 1 common equity ratio was 1117 at december 31 2014 compared to 1122 at december 31 2013 

generally for riskbased capital purposes deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarterend date based on its projected future taxable income for the year or ii 10 of the amount of an institution’s tier 1 capital at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier 1 capital and riskweighted assets at december 31 2014 for key’s consolidated operations we had a federal net deferred tax asset of 195 million and a state deferred tax asset of 22 million compared to a federal net deferred tax asset of 184 million and a state deferred tax asset of 7 million at december 31 2013 we have recorded a valuation allowance of less than 1 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards at december 31 2014 compared to 1 million at december 31 2013

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 11 “variable interest entities” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2014 is presented in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 20 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 30 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2014 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 30 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

  

 guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other 

 

variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 20 under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit compliance operational capital and liquidity market reputation strategic and model risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the keycorp board of directors the “board” serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the board’s audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal requirements independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions including internal audit financial reporting legal matters and fraud risk the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 

the board’s risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies policies procedures and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprisewide risk including credit market liquidity model operational compliance reputation and strategic risks the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy capital planning and capital actions the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework which includes review of the enterprise risk management erm policy including the risk appetite statement and management and erm reports and approval of any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management 

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee annually the board reviews and approves the erm policy as well as the risk appetite including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating analyzing and reporting risk information risk review provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness appropriateness and adherence to keycorp’s risk management policies practices and controls 

the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions ensures appropriate ownership of risks provides input into performance and compensation decisions assesses aggregate enterprise risk monitors capabilities to manage critical risks and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline when market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 

we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement these positions are subject to various marketbased risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings are nontrading positions these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions primarily changes in interest rates 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading investing and client facilitation activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets business key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture oversight of trading market risks is governed by the risk committee of our board the erm committee and the market risk committee these committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our market risk management group “mrm” that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring 

 

activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment 

mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” in this report instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

 

  

  

 var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation 

  

additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancelable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level 

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s risk management group on an annual basis the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to observed daily profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var actual losses did not exceed daily trading var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 

we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level for all covered positions was 9 million at december 31 2014 and 10 million at december 31 2013 the decrease in aggregate var was primarily due to reduced exposures in credit and interest rate derivatives figure 31 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 

figure 31 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

 stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99 confidence level and applying certain assumptions the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 26 million at december 31 2014 and 29 million at december 31 2013 figure 32 summarizes our stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes 

  

figure 32 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

 internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset position which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach specific risk calculations are run quarterly by mrm and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the risk committee of our board the erm committee and the alco these committees review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis the market risk management group as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

 

  

  

   

  

 net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments including a most likely macroeconomic scenario simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 

we measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months and term rates were to move in a similar fashion our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points but due to the low interest rate environment we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including a sustained flat yield curve an inverted slope yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance shifts investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in shortterm or intermediateterm interest rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 as shown in figure 33 we are operating within these levels as of december 31 2014 

  

figure 33 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 the results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 33 net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts the unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50 and 60 for interestbearing deposits and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling the sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 75 basis point range of modeled results 

key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase modestly prior to any increase in the federal funds rate our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12 24 and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31 2014 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and 

  

liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 34 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities”

 liquidity risk management 

liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board of directors the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the market risk management group as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board’s enhanced prudential standards 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2014 are shown in figure 35 we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 35 credit ratings 

 

 managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at 

  

december 31 2014 totaled 15 billion consisting of 104 billion of unpledged securities 799 million of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati “fhlb” and 38 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2014 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 187 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 28 billion at the fhlb in 2014 key’s outstanding fhlb advances decreased by 24 million due to repayments 

final us liquidity coverage ratio 

under the liquidity coverage rules we will be required to calculate the modified lcr implementation for modified lcr banking organizations like key will begin on january 1 2016 with a minimum requirement of 90 coverage reaching 100 coverage by january 1 2017 throughout december 2014 our estimated modified lcr was approximately in the mid80 range to reach the minimum of 90 by january 1 2016 and to operate with a cushion above the minimum required level we may change the composition of our investment portfolio increase the size of the overall investment portfolio and modify product offerings 

additional information about the liquidity coverage ratio is included in the “supervision and regulation” section under the heading “us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework” in item 1 of this report 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2014 our loantodeposit ratio was 85 which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 18 “longterm debt” that are designed to enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board of directors and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs during the second quarter of 2014 the keycorp shelf registration statement on file with the sec including the mediumterm note program was updated in connection with the updated mediumterm note program the board of directors authorized keycorp to issue up to 4 billion of debt and revoked all prior issuance authority under previous keycorp shelf registration statements including through previous mediumterm note programs 

in 2014 key’s aggregate outstanding note balance net of unamortized discounts and adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial instruments was unchanged on july 1 2014 750 million of subordinated bank debt matured on november 24 2014 750 million of 250 senior notes due 2019 were issued 

  

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity to meet all projected obligations we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2014 keycorp held 22 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2014 keybank paid keycorp 300 million in dividends nonbank subsidiaries did not pay any cash dividends or noncash dividends to keycorp keycorp did not make any capital infusions to keybank during 2014 as of december 31 2014 keybank had 935 million of capacity to pay dividends to keycorp 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past 12 months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of net customer loan and deposit flows and an increase in unpledged securities the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 195 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2014 as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 7 million in taxes to be paid if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately 11 million accordingly we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2014 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 

  

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 16 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2014 we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was 43 million at december 31 2014 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2014 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 309 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity at december 31 2014 we had sold credit default swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of 5 million 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income 

 

we may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2014 the alll was 794 million or 138 of periodend loans compared to 848 million or 156 at december 31 2013 the allowance includes 40 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 302 million at december 31 2014 compared to 42 million that was allocated for impaired loans of 358 million one year ago for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2014 the alll was 1900 of nonperforming loans compared to 1669 at december 31 2013 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 36 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 36 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

  

  

 we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our general allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 

for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of 25 million and greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price secured consumer loan tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full on at least a quarterly basis we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses the alll at december 31 2014 represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

  

as shown in figure 37 our alll decreased by 54 million or 64 during the past 12 months this contraction is directly associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio the quality of new loan originations and decreasing levels of criticized classified and nonperforming loans and net loan chargeoffs has resulted in a reduction in our general allowance our delinquency trends have declined during the past 12 months due to a modest level of loan growth relatively stable economic conditions and continued runoff in our exit loan portfolio reflecting our effort to maintain a moderate enterprise risk tolerance our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments was 36 million at december 31 2014 when combined with our alll our total allowance for credit losses represented 145 of periodend loans at december 31 2014 compared to 163 at december 31 2013 

figure 37 allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

  

   

our provision credit for loan and lease losses was 59 million for 2014 compared to 130 million for 2013 our net loan chargeoffs were 113 million for 2014 compared to 168 million for 2013 the decrease in our provision is due to continued improvement in credit quality experienced in most of our loan portfolios additionally we continue to reduce our exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net loan chargeoffs 

credit quality on our oil and gas loan portfolio which represents 2 of total loans at december 31 2014 remains solid with net loan chargeoffs lower than those on our overall portfolio our alll reflects the estimated impact of current oil prices at december 31 2014 

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2014 totaled 113 million or 20 of average loans compared to net loan chargeoffs of 168 million or 32 for the same period last year figure 38 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 39 

over the past 12 months net loan chargeoffs decreased 55 million this decrease is attributable to continued improvement in asset quality as reflected in the asset quality statistics shown in figure 40 as shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of 13 million in net loan chargeoffs for 2014 net loan chargeoffs for 2013 in our exit loan portfolio were 17 million the decrease in net loan chargeoffs in our exit loan portfolio was primarily driven by lower levels of net loan charge offs in the consumer exit loan portfolios during 2014

figure 40 summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans from continuing operations 

 

  

  

  

  

 as shown in figure 40 nonperforming assets decreased during 2014 having declined for the past five years most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our consumer and commercial loan portfolios as 

  

shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 41 million or 9 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2014 compared to 56 million or 11 at december 31 2013 

at december 31 2014 the approximate carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 74 of their original contractual amount total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 79 of their contractual amount and total nonperforming assets represented 79 of their original contractual amount at the same date oreo represented 79 of its original contractual amount 

at december 31 2014 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 88 million representing 21 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations compared to 86 million representing 17 in the prior year 

figure 41 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2014 and 2013 the net loan chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of those loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 4 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2014 and 2013 additional information about loan sales is included in the “loans and loans held for sale” section under “loan sales”

 operational and compliance risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key primary responsibility for managing 

 

and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee a senior management committee oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage we and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of our operations material harm to our customers and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients 

fourth quarter results 

figure 45 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2014 are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 246 million or 28 per common share compared to 229 million or 26 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2013 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 112 compared to 108 for the fourth quarter of 2013 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 950 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 910 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 588 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the net interest margin was 294 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 589 million and a net interest margin of 301 for the fourth quarter of 2013 the decrease in net interest margin was largely attributable to lower earning asset yields and higher levels of excess liquidity driven by commercial deposit growth 

 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 490 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 453 million for the yearago quarter the fourth quarter reflects a record high quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which increased 42 million benefiting from our business model trust and investment services income increased 14 million mostly due to a fullquarter impact of the recentlyacquired pacific crest securities corporate services income also increased 13 million driven by higher derivatives income and nonyield loan fees these increases were partially offset by declines in other income of 12 million mortgage servicing fees of 11 million and operating lease income and other leasing gains of 11 million 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 704 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 712 million for the same period last year this decline reflects lower efficiency and pensionrelated charges and other expense these decreases were slightly offset by higher incentive compensation expense related to the performance of our business and a fullquarter impact of the recentlyacquired pacific crest securities

our provision for loan and lease losses was 22 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 19 million for the yearago quarter our alll was 794 million or 138 of total periodend loans at december 31 2014 compared to 848 million or 156 at december 31 2013 

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled 32 million or 22 of average loans compared to 37 million or 27 for the same period last year 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 94 million compared to a tax provision of 70 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 272 compared to 23 for the same quarter one year ago due to an increase in pretax income

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balances of 25 million or greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2014 would indicate the need for a 16 million increase in the allowance the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 41 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 10 million or 01 per common share a 41 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 26 million or 03 per common share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the alll would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2014 151 billion or 16 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2014 12 billion or 1 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

at december 31 2014 18 million or less than 1 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis all of these assets were classified as level 3 at december 31 2014 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 

 

406 million at december 31 2014 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2014 earnings by approximately 41 million 25 million after tax or 03 per common share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance that was effective for us on january 1 2012 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2014 therefore the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly the acquisition of pacific crest securities during the third quarter of 2014 resulted in a 78 million increase in the goodwill at the key corporate bank unit at december 31 2014 the key community bank reporting unit had 979 million in goodwill and the key corporate bank reporting unit had 78 million in goodwill additional information is provided in note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 16 “employee benefits” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2014 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

derivatives and hedging 

we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting 

 

guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 20 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2014 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

during 2014 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

acquisitions and divestitures 

the information presented in note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures the financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation continued during 2013 and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial institutions including through the fdic leastcost resolution process albeit at a far slower pace than during 2012 and 2011 financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and other resolutions and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 167 banks that failed between 2011 and 2013 representing 526 billion in total assets were redistributed through the fdic’s leastcost resolution process 

supervision and regulation 

the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the dif and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit 

overview 

as a bhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval by the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

under federal law a bhc must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress this support may be required when we do not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 

federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators such as the occ 

  

for national banks and federal savings associations the fdic for nonmember state banks and savings associations the federal reserve for member state banks the cfpb for consumer financial products or services the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities the sec and cftc for swaps and other derivatives and state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2013 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and two national bank subsidiaries that are limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory capital and liquidity 

current regulatory capital requirements 

federal banking regulators have promulgated riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to key and keybank the adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities 

the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by federal banking regulators are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” under current requirements key and keybank generally must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets of 8 at least half of the total capital must be “tier 1 capital” comprised of qualifying perpetual preferred stock common shareholders’ equity excluding aoci other than the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and certain mandatorily convertible preferred securities the remainder may consist of “tier 2 capital” including qualifying subordinated debt certain hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt instruments qualifying perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses 

bhcs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities exceeding specified levels are required to maintain capital to cover their market risk exposure in accordance with regulations adopted by federal banking regulators market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as movements in interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk because key and keybank each have trading assets and liabilities of at least 1 billion or 10 of total assets key is subject to the federal reserve’s rule and keybank is subject to the occ’s rule on market risk regulatory capital which became effective in january 2013 in december 2013 the federal reserve revised effective april 1 2014 or earlier if a bhc elects to adopt it earlier its market risk capital rule relating to the treatment of certain securitization sovereign and investment company exposures as well as the timing of disclosures to align the rule to the regulatory capital rules 

  

described below until they become fully effective for all bhcs as part of the regulatory capital rules described below the occ included in its market risk capital rule revisions relating to the treatment of the securitization and sovereign exposures addressed in the federal reserve’s revisions 

federal banking regulators also have established a minimum leverage ratio requirement for banking organizations the leverage ratio is tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is currently 3 for bhcs and national banks that are considered “strong” by the federal reserve or the occ respectively 3 for any bhc that has implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk and 4 for all other bhcs and national banks the current minimum leverage ratio for key and keybank is 3 and 4 respectively 

bhcs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile or growth plans at december 31 2013 key and keybank had regulatory capital in excess of all current minimum riskbased capital including all adjustments for market risk and leverage ratio requirements 

the fdia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a fdicinsured depository institution that does not meet certain capital adequacy standards such institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures restrictions on operations management and capital distributions begin to apply at “adequately capitalized” status and become progressively stricter as the insured depository institution approaches “critically undercapitalized” status an institution is considered “well capitalized” if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure while the prompt corrective action requirements only apply to fdicinsured depository institutions and not to bhcs the mandatory prompt corrective action “capital restoration plan” required of an undercapitalized institution by its relevant regulator must be guaranteed to a limited extent by the institution’s parent bhc 

basel iii capital and liquidity frameworks 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework to strengthen international capital regulation of banks and revised it in june 2011 as revised the “basel iii capital framework” the basel iii capital framework requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement and measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress the basel iii capital framework among other things introduces a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” to be included in tier 1 capital with other capital instruments meeting specified requirements 

for banks with regulators adopting basel iii capital framework in full implementation of the basel iii capital framework commenced january 1 2013 to be fully phased in on january 1 2019 beginning january 2013 such banks are required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 35 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 45 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 80 total that is tier 1 plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets a “capital conservation buffer” effectively raising each of the minimum capital requirements by 25 will be phasedin pro rata over a fouryear period beginning january 1 2016 reaching the full 25 on january 1 2019 accordingly such banks subject to the fully phasedin basel iii capital framework would be required to maintain effective minimum capital ratios of 7 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 85 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 105 total capital to riskweighted assets a minimum leverage ratio of 3 calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to “total exposure” including on and certain offbalance sheet exposures is also imposed on such banks beginning january 1 2018 the basel iii capital framework also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk the “countercyclical capital 

  

buffer” if imposed would impose an additional 0 to 25 buffer to the “capital conservation buffer” for common equity tier 1 when fully implemented the basel iii capital framework also provides for a number of adjustments to and deductions from tier 1 capital which began on january 1 2014 in january 2014 the basel committee’s oversight body endorsed certain revisions to the leverage ratio framework and disclosure requirements of the basel iii capital framework the “january 2014 basel iii leverage ratio revisions” 

the basel committee published its international liquidity standards in 2010 and revised these standards in january 2013 as revised the “basel iii liquidity framework” it established quantitative standards for liquidity by introducing a liquidity coverage ratio “basel iii lcr” and a net stable funding ratio “basel iii nsfr” the basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of the stock of highquality liquid assets divided by total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days must be at least 100 the basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the available amount of stable funding divided by the required amount of stable funding must also be at least 100 the implementation of basel iii lcr begins on january 1 2015 with minimum requirements beginning at 60 rising in annual steps of 10 until full implementation on january 1 2019 the basel committee has indicated that revisions to the basel iii nsfr will be made by mid2016 and the net stable funding ratio will be introduced as a requirement on january 1 2018 in january 2014 the basel committee’s oversight body endorsed certain final basel iii lcr disclosure standards and certain proposed basel iii nsfr revisions the “january 2014 basel iii liquidity framework revisions” 

us implementation of the basel iii capital framework 

in october 2013 the federal banking regulators published the final basel iii capital framework for us banking organizations the “regulatory capital rules” the regulatory capital rules generally implement the basel iii capital framework as described above in the united states but set a minimum leverage ratio of 4 to be calculated consistently with currently applicable regulatory capital requirements calculated as tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets less any amounts that were also deducted from tier 1 capital in addition the regulatory capital rules address two capitalrelated provisions of the doddfrank act first the provision that general riskbased and leverage capital requirements applicable to fdicinsured deposit institutions that are not “advanced approaches” depository institutions like keybank act as a floor for the requirements applicable to all bhcs like keycorp as well as to all “advanced approaches” banking organizations and second the provision that references to external credit ratings be removed from the regulators’ rules and replaced with alternative standards of creditworthiness 

the impact of the january 2014 basel iii leverage ratio revisions on us banking organizations including key and keybank will be determined by the extent to which they are implemented by the federal banking agencies neither the federal reserve nor the occ have proposed any rule to implement these revisions 

  

new minimum capital requirements 

under the regulatory capital rules “standardized approach” banking organizations like key will be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the table below at december 31 2013 key had an estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 107 under basel iii also at december 31 2013 based on the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios would be as set forth in the table below 

estimated ratios vs minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin 

regulatory capital rules 

 

  

  

 revised prompt corrective action standards 

under the regulatory capital rules the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank will be revised effective january 1 2015 the revised prompt corrective action table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the current rule and the regulatory capital rules 

“well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” capital category ratios under current and 

revised prompt corrective action rules 

 

  

 we believe that as of december 31 2013 keybank would meet all “well capitalized” capital adequacy requirements under the regulatory capital rules if such requirements were currently effective as previously indicated the prompt corrective action requirements only apply to fdicinsured depository institutions and not to bhcs like keycorp 

  

us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework 

in november 2013 the federal banking agencies published a joint npr seeking comment on proposed rules that would create a minimum liquidity coverage ratio “lcr” for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies not including key and a modified version of the lcr “modified lcr” for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active including key the lcr and modified lcr created by the npr are based on the basel iii liquidity framework and would be an enhanced prudential liquidity standard consistent with the doddfrank act comments on the npr were due by january 31 2014 

under the npr keycorp would be required to maintain highquality liquid assets of at least 100 of its total net cash outflow amount determined by prescribed assumptions in a hypothetical stress scenario over a 21calendar day period implementation of the lcr and modified lcr would begin january 1 2015 with minimum requirements of 80 rising in equal annual steps of 10 to reach full implementation on january 1 2017 keybank will not be subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the npr unless the occ determines that application to keybank is appropriate in light of its asset size level of complexity risk profile scope of operations affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities or risk to the financial system keycorp is confident that it will be able to comply with the modified lcr once the proposed rule is finalized and implemented notwithstanding the foregoing there are two components of the npr that could present some challenges for keycorp if the npr is implemented as proposed keybank would likely limit the amount of collateralized deposits it accepts from states and municipalities ie “preferred deposits” further reduce the amount of interest it pays on those deposits or eliminate the earnings credits it extends to states and municipalities securities issued by us governmentsponsored enterprises “gses” are a primary tool for liquidity management at key and currently constitute a significant amount of our stock of high quality liquid assets the npr would treat these securities as level 2a liquid assets instead of level 1 liquid assets while the gses are under conservatorship limiting our ability to rely on them as high quality liquid assets key continues to manage in the direction to be modified lcr compliant by the end of 2014 through changes to the composition of our investment portfolio and by focusing on growing our client deposits that are not preferred deposits the impact of the january 2014 basel iii liquidity framework revisions on us banking organizations including key and keybank will be determined by the extent to which they are implemented by the federal banking agencies 

capital planning and stress testing 

the federal reserve’s capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted annually to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with its annual ccar the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including key’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio of 5 on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon keycorp is also subject to the federal reserve capital plan rule and supervisory guidance regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and capital redemptions repurchases including the supervisory expectation in certain circumstances for prior notification to and consultation with federal reserve supervisory staff 

the federal reserve’s annual ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large complex us bhcs and of the policies and practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve assesses the capital plans of these bhcs to ensure that they have both sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of financial and economic stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have sufficient capital to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases 

keycorp filed its 2014 ccar capital plan on january 6 2014 under the federal reserve’s november 2013 ccar instructions and guidance keycorp’s 2014 capital plan was required to reflect the regulatory capital 

  

rules including their minimum regulatory capital ratios and transition arrangements as well as key’s tier 1 common ratio for each quarter of the planning horizon using the definitions of tier 1 capital and total riskweighted assets as in effect in 2013 as well as a transition plan for full implementation of the regulatory capital rules results from 2014 ccar which will include the 2014 supervisory stress test methodology and certain firmspecific results for the participating 30 covered companies including keycorp are expected to be released in march 2014 

as part of the annual ccar the federal reserve conducts an annual supervisory stress test on keycorp as part of this test the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels regulatory capital ratios and the tier 1 common ratio under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios that are determined annually by the federal reserve 

keycorp and keybank must also conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank must only conduct an annual stress test keycorp must conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank are required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and occ in early january of each year and keycorp is required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve in early july of each year summaries of the results of these tests are disclosed in march of each year for the annual tests and september of each year for the midcycle test on the “regulatory disclosure” tab of key’s investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir 

dividend restrictions 

federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be in a less than “adequately capitalized” prompt corrective action capital category or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note 3 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” in this report 

fdia resolution authority and financial stability 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank pursuant to the doddfrank act the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased permanently from 100000 to 250000 per depository 

under the doddfrank act the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository intuition’s assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized premium assessments can range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybank’s performance on the fdic’s “large and highly complex institution” riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybank’s regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

  

conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution’s affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of key’s insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors 

receivership of certain sifis 

the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the “orderly liquidation authority” “ola” for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind up a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifi’s failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president 

if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdic’s powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors’ claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdic’s right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors’ claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdic’s right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology 

in december 2013 the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its “single point of entry” resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifi’s toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company comments on the notice are due by february 18 2014 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an 

  

insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institution’s parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

resolution plans 

bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keybank are also required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans are due annually by december 31 of each year for 2013 keycorp and keybank elected to submit a joint resolution plan given key’s organizational structure and business activities and the significance of keybank to key this resolution plan the first required from keycorp and keybank was submitted on december 9 2013 in january 2014 the federal reserve and fdic made available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies that submitted plans for the first time in december 2013 the public section of the joint resolution plan of keycorp and keybank is available at httpwwwfederalreservegovbankinforegresolutionplanshtm 

financial stability oversight council 

the doddfrank act created the fsoc a systemic risk oversight body to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa’s requirements 

other regulatory developments under the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than 10 billion like key for compliance with federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to our consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices 

  

during 2013 the cfpb issued a series of final rules related to residential mortgage loan origination and servicing in particular in january 2013 the cfpb issued a final rule implementing the abilitytorepay rules and qualified mortgage provisions of the truth in lending act as amended by the doddfrank act under these rules a lender must make a reasonable good faith determination that a borrower is able to repay a mortgage before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower loans meeting the definition of “qualified mortgage” are granted a presumption that the lender satisfied the abilitytorepay requirements the cfpb has also issued rules affecting other aspects of the residential mortgage loan process ranging from the customer application to servicing of the loan these changes and additions to consumer mortgage banking rules have required enhancements to our compliance programs as well as changes to key’s systems and loan processing practices the ability to repay and qualified mortgage rules became effective on january 10 2014 

debit card interchange 

federal reserve regulation ii — debit card interchange fees and routing the “interchange rule” — limits debit card interchange fees and eliminates exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions the relevant portions of the interchange rule became effective october 1 2011 

on july 31 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia issued a ruling in nacs v board of governors of the federal reserve system  vacating the interchange rule retail merchants and merchant groups challenged the federal reserve’s final rule which allowed debit card issuers to recover from merchants an interchange fee of 21 per transaction a fee of five basis points of the value of the transaction and an additional 01 fraud prevention adjustment the district court held that this fee structure and the interchange rule’s requirements regarding the number of networks over which each debit card transaction can be processed did not comply with the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act on september 19 2013 the court of appeals for the dc circuit granted a joint motion by the parties for expedited appeal of the district court’s opinion the parties filed briefs with the court in december 2013 and oral arguments were held in january 2014 the interchange rule remains in effect until resolution of the appeal by the circuit court we continue to monitor these developments 

“volcker rule” 

in december 2013 federal banking regulators issued a joint final rule the “final rule” implementing section 619 of the doddfrank act known as the “volcker rule” the final rule prohibits “banking entities” such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as “covered funds” and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments 

the final rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers banking entities may also engage in riskmitigating hedges if the entity can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis banking entities with more than 50 billion in total consolidated assets and liabilities like key that engage in permitted trading transactions are required to implement enhanced compliance programs to regularly report data on trading activities to the regulators and to provide a ceo attestation that the entity’s compliance program is reasonably designed to comply with the final rule 

although the final rule will take effect april 1 2014 the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july 21 2015 key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the final rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail under the heading “other investments” in item 7 of this report 

  

derivatives 

title vii of the doddfrank act imposes a new comprehensive regulatory regime on the us derivatives markets subjecting nearly all derivative transactions to cftc or sec regulation in may 2012 the cftc and the sec issued joint final rules defining the terms “swap dealer” and “securitybased swap dealer” the final rules specified that generally a swap dealer is an entity engaging in 3 billion in notional value of nonexempt swap activity in any 12month period commencing october 12 2012 subject to an initial phasein threshold of 8 billion in notional value as a result in november 2013 keybank provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the national futures association the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry as a provisionallyregistered swap dealer keybank is required to develop and adhere to a specified compliance program 

the cftc has also finalized regulations establishing recordkeeping requirements swap data reporting requirements swap dealer business conduct standards mandatory swap clearing requirements and swap trade execution requirements other regulations required by the doddfrank act including capital and margin requirements additional mandatory clearing designations and position limits have not been finalized and the timeframe for their completion remains unclear 

enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements 

under the doddfrank act the federal reserve must impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements upon bhcs with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp prudential standards must include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits enhanced liquidity requirements a singlecounterparty credit limit enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements both supervisory and companyrun stress tests and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements must include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which are to be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures on february 18 2014 the federal reserve issued its final rule implementing a number of enhanced prudential standards regarding liquidity risk management and capital key is currently reviewing the final rule to determine its impact 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’slength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc certain of the victory mutual funds with which we continue to have a relationship and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance 

  

with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them 

new assessments fees and other charges 

certain provisions of the doddfrank act require or authorize certain us governmental departments agencies and instrumentalities to collect new assessments fees and other charges from bhcs and banks like keycorp and keybank the us treasury has adopted a final rule establishing an assessment schedule to collect from sifis including keycorp based on their average total consolidated assets semiannual assessments to pay the expenses of the ofr including the expenses of the fsoc and certain expenses for implementing the orderly liquidation activities of the fdic the federal reserve has established an annual assessment upon sifis including keycorp based on their average total consolidated assets for the federal reserve’s examination supervision and regulation of such companies 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 

our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk liquidity risk operational risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report 

i credit risk 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the us economy remains vulnerable and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the nascent recovery in commercial real estate the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents has continued to lag behind the overall economy these economic factors generally affect certain industries like real estate and financial services more significantly a significant portion of our clients are active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans 

a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases which may also lead to existing lease turnover 

we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend 

  

credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the alll bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the alll ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll which would decrease our net income and capital 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the recession from december 2007 to june 2009 the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels the severe market disruption in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing the widespread liquidation of assets and constraining the credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 

we have heightened credit exposure in highbalance loans and loans in environmentally sensitive industries 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 70 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 

we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmentalrelated covenants which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants our credit quality could be adversely affected the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs 

  

ii compliance risks 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional compliance costs and increase our litigation and regulatory costs should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 

the regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly affected by financial regulatory reform initiatives including the doddfrank act 

the united states and other governments have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry we have faced increased regulation of our industry and will continue to face such regulation into 2014 as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide financial market stability and enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions we also faced increased regulation from efforts designed to protect consumers from financial abuse 

we expect continued intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations on the federal and state levels particularly due to keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions under the enhanced prudential standards promulgated under the doddfrank act although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts will continue to be implemented over the next few years as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act as fully implemented compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives has and will continue to increase our costs may reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities and limit our ability to take certain types of corporate actions for more detailed information on the regulatory environment and the laws rules and regulations that may affect us see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

changes in accounting policies rules and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 

the fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards from time to time change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key’s financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change or even reverse prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results 

  

iii capital and liquidity risk 

capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act will require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case 

new and evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of recently adopted capital and liquidity rules see the section titled “regulatory capital and liquidity” under the heading “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

the full effect of the federal reserve’s proposed liquidity standards on key is uncertain at this time however the need to maintain more and higher quality capital together with new requirements for greater liquidity could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions it could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid short term investments or change our mix of funding alternatives and may impact business relationships with certain customers it could reduce our ability to invest in longerterm assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective 

in addition the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bank holding companies should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

federal agencies may no longer support current initiatives or may not implement new initiatives to support the stability of the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment including its monthly purchases of treasury bonds and mortgagebacked securities to help stabilize the economy given the fomc’s legal mandates to maximize employment maintain stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates in light of recent moderate improvements in the us economy federal agencies may no longer continue to support current initiatives the federal reserve announced in december 2013 it will “taper” its monthly purchases of treasury bonds and mortgagebacked securities as the economy continues to improve the discontinuation of marketsupporting government and agency initiatives particularly a sudden discontinuation may have a negative impact perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include a sudden move to higher debt yields which could have a chilling effect on borrowing in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize a troubled economy even if new legislation or initiatives were necessary it is uncertain that any legislation or initiative could be implemented in a timely fashion or at all in the current political climate additionally any program implemented or legislation enacted to counter the effects of program discontinuation or a sudden economic downturn may be insufficient to support financial market stability or promote us economic recovery 

we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends by our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on 

  

our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions including by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding experienced significant disruption and volatility during the 2008 financial crisis while these disrupted markets have shown signs of recovery if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed conditions similar to those experienced in the liquidity crisis of 20072009 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies as a result of the doddfrank act there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income 

iv operational risk 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of 

  

their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us 

third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf these thirdparty vendors are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees one or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by the thirdparty vendor certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business federal banking regulators recently issued regulatory guidance on how banks select engage and manage their outside vendors these regulations may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb 

there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

  

we are subject to operational risk 

we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses 

v market risk 

a reversal of the fragile us economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets 

the slow economic recovery and multiple downside shocks have presented a challenge for key and adversely affected our business and financial performance these economic conditions may persist for some time and continue to have a negative impact on us a worsening of conditions could aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on key and others in the financial services industry risks related to the global economy have eased somewhat but challenges remain 

in particular we would face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment whether in domestic or international markets 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our earnings on loans and other interestearning assets 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “risk management — management of interest risk exposure” found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments with which we conduct significant business 

we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located — oregon and alaska washington rocky mountains indiana west ohiomichigan east ohio eastern new york new england and western new york — and potential exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint the moderate us economic recovery has been experienced unevenly in the various regions where we operate and there can be no assurance that continued improvement in the overall us economy will result in similar improvement or any improvement at all in the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us 

  

additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated with the real estate health care and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments 

an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions however are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 

vi reputation risk 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry has declined since the 2008 financial crisis we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry can also significantly adversely affect our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

vii strategic risk 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing revenue building and maintaining longterm customer relationships maintaining financial strength and building on our culture of efficiency enhancing relationships with our customers including by “crossselling” additional or new products to them is very important to our business model and our ability to grow revenue and earnings our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 

  

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices maintaining our high ethical standards and safe and sound assets and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry and our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and smart phones requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest margin 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the 

  

federal reserve which may identify deficiencies in the structure causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company diversion of our management’s time and attention and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction additionally if an acquisition were to occur we may fail to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence or other projected benefits 

viii model risk 

we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management and capital planning functions 

we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating probable loan losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code bad data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design 

as a result our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable 

banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators

 economic overview 

the economy continued its modest recovery in 2013 with overall gdp starting slowly and accelerating as the year progressed resulting in 19 growth in 2013 us economic growth during 2013 was plagued by policy and political headwinds the year began with uncertainty around the potential effects of the looming sequester and a large payroll tax increase in the second quarter the federal reserve sent mixed messages regarding when it would begin scaling back its latest round of quantitative easing inadvertently causing interest rates to increase and hindering the housing recovery in the fourth quarter the federal government endured a 16day shutdown and briefly approached a breach of the federal debt ceiling in spite of these issues growth accelerated in the second half of the year although the shutdown temporarily disrupted positive momentum consumer confidence increased financial markets continued to rise and the housing market rebounded from a summer slump to close out the year the stock market boomed in 2013 with the sp 500 equity index increasing 30 compared to a 13 increase in 2012 globally the modest recovery continued central banks in developed nations maintained easy money policies in the second half of the year europe’s recession ended emerging markets did not fare as well — demand decreased exports dropped and china grew at its slowest rate in 20 years 

for the year 219 million new jobs were added in the us the unemployment rate fell further from 79 at december 31 2012 to 67 at december 31 2013 while job growth was a factor the majority of the improvement was driven by a decrease in the labor force participation rate which declined to its lowest level in over 35 years wage growth deteriorated through much of the year and income growth was weak both due in part to the payroll tax hikes and the sequester however consumer spending held up reasonably well resulting in a falling savings rate a slowing rate of inflation supported incomes and therefore spending throughout the year by december 2013 headline inflation was down to 15 compared to 17 one year earlier core inflation also remained low through the year ending 2013 at 17 down from 19 in 2012 

the housing market provided another boost in 2013 with improvement in nearly all metrics with the economy continuing its modest expansion and home prices appearing to stabilize demand for forsale housing posted steady gains throughout the year as mortgage rates rose sales of existing homes began to diminish finishing 2013 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 487 million down slightly from december 2012 new home sales improved reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414000 in december 2013 up 45 from 2012 as the share of distressed transactions fell the pace of price appreciation increased with the median price for existing homes up 99 yearoveryear in december 2013 housing starts accelerated further with starts up 18 over 2012’s totals driven primarily by substantial gains in both single and multifamily construction 

the federal reserve remained active and accommodative in 2013 keeping the federal funds target rate near zero expanding its balance sheet further and making significant changes to its communications the latest round of quantitative easing was held constant until december driven by mixed economic results troubling inflation data and the government shutdown in december the federal reserve announced it would begin tapering the pace of asset purchases by 10 billion from 85 billion per month to 75 billion per month in january 2014 with the expectation that the pace of purchases will continue to drop throughout 2014 in addition the federal reserve updated its forward guidance in december explicitly stating that the federal funds rate will be kept near zero well past a 65 unemployment rate low inflation remains a concern and will be monitored closely longtime chairman ben bernanke also made his exit with vicechair janet yellen replacing bernanke starting in february 2014 the 10year us treasury yield began the year at 19 and was range bound from 1520 for the first half of the year driven by disappointing economic data around the year’s halfway point with more positive data rates began to increase approaching 30 in september on expectations that the federal reserve would soon begin to 

  

taper quantitative easing asset purchases the taper did not begin as expected and the october government shutdown helped to keep rates down in the 2526 range for the majority of the fourth quarter until surprisingly positive economic data prompted the federal reserve to reduce asset purchases by 10 billion at the december meeting rates subsequently rose and closed the year at 30

we initiated the following actions during 2013 to support our corporate strategy 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 highlights of our 2013 performance 

financial performance 

for 2013 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 847 million or 93 per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 813 million or 86 per common share for 2012

our fullyear results for 2013 reflect success in executing our strategies by growing loans acquiring a commercial real estate servicing portfolio and special servicing business and achieving annualized run rate savings in excess of our goal 

we ended 2013 with annual run rate savings of approximately 241 million as a result of our efficiency initiative we continue to invest in future revenue growth by upgrading our technology to meet the needs of our clients and looking for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network in 2013 we shifted our focus related to our branch network more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint into more attractive markets during 2013 we consolidated 62 branches as part of our efficiency initiative we also realigned our community bank organization to strengthen our relationshipbased business model while responding to economic factors and evolving client expectations we remain committed to delivering on our goal of achieving a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65 as we enter 2014 

the net interest margin from continuing operations was 312 for 2013 a decrease of nine basis points from 2012 this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of lower asset yields combined with a significant increase in liquidity levels from strong deposit inflows in 2014 we expect the net interest margin will continue to be under pressure from elevated levels of liquidity and the impact of low interest rates 

average total loans increased 27 billion or 53 during 2013 compared to 2012 the average balances of commercial financial and agricultural loans increased from 211 billion to 237 billion or approximately 122 we continued to have success in growing our commercial loan portfolio by acquiring new clients in our focus industries as well as expanding existing relationships for 2014 we anticipate average total loans to grow in the midsingle digit range continuing to be led by growth in our commercial financial and agricultural loans 

we continued to improve the mix of deposits during 2013 as we experienced a 63 billion or 121 increase in nontime deposits approximately 44 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december 31 2013 with an average cost of 93 are scheduled to mature over the next twelve months the maturation of these certificates of deposit and other liability repricing opportunities will continue to help offset repricing pressure on our assets this improved funding mix reduced the cost of interestbearing deposits during 2013 compared to 2012 our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 838 at december 31 2013 compared to 858 at december 31 2012 

our asset quality statistics continued to improve during 2013 net loan chargeoffs declined to 168 million or 32 of average loan balances for 2013 compared to 345 million or 69 for 2012 in addition our nonperforming loans declined to 508 million or 93 of periodend loans at december 31 2013 compared to 674 million or 128 at december 31 2012 our alll was 848 million or 156 of periodend loans compared to 888 million or 168 at december 31 2012 and represented 1669 and 1318 coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively we expect net loan chargeoffs to average loans during 2014 to remain at the lower end or below our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points 

our tangible common equity ratio and tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at december 31 2013 at 980 and 1122 respectively compared to 1015 and 1136 respectively at december 31 2012 these ratios have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group for these measures we have identified four primary uses of capital 

 

  

  

  

   

our capital management remains focused on creating value to that end we returned approximately 76 of our net income to shareholders through both common share repurchases and dividends in 2013 we also used our capital to acquire a commercial real estate servicing portfolio and special servicing business 

the federal reserve is currently reviewing of our 2014 capital plan under the ccar process until such time as it has completed its review and has no objection to our plan we are not permitted to implement our capital plan for periods after the first quarter of 2014 should we receive an objection to our plan it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year for more information about the ccar process see “capital planning and stress testing” under “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

figure 4 presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible common equity” “tier 1 common equity” “preprovision net revenue” “cash efficiency ratio” and “adjusted cash efficiency ratio” 

the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock tier 1 common equity a nongaap financial measure is a component of tier 1 riskbased capital tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before january 1 2015 however since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations since early 2009 the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as tier 1 common equity because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories the regulatory capital rules described in more detail under the section “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report also make tier 1 common equity a priority the regulatory capital rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by among other changes phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital by 2016 our trust preferred securities will only be included in tier 2 capital 

figure 4 also shows the computation for preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

the cash efficiency ratio and adjusted cash efficiency ratio are ratios of two nongaap performance measures accordingly there are no directly comparable gaap performance measures the cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation the adjusted cash efficiency ratio further removes the impact of the efficiency initiative and pension settlement charges we believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

 results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past five years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2013 was 23 billion and the net interest margin was 312 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 23 billion and a net interest margin of 321 for the prior year total 2013 net interest income increased compared to the prior year because the interest expense associated with lower deposit costs declined by more than interest income the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of average earning assets higheryielding loans were paid down and replaced by new originations with lower yields yields on the investment portfolio also declined the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to continued improvements in the mix of deposits the volume of low cost nontime and noninterest bearing deposit balances increased and higher costing certificates of deposit and longterm debt matured 

average earning assets for 2013 totaled 754 billion which was 35 billion or 49 higher than the 2012 level the increase reflects 27 billion of loan growth primarily in commercial financial and agricultural loans as well as the 2012 acquisitions of credit cards and other loans our investment portfolio increased 900 million as a result of our strategy to increase our liquidity position

figure 6 components of net interest income changes from continuing operations 

 

  

 noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2013 was 18 billion down 90 million or 48 from 2012 in 2012 noninterest income increased by 168 million or 10 compared to 2011 

operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased 87 million from 2012 primarily due to fewer early terminations in the leveraged lease portfolio consumer mortgage income declined 21 million and net gains losses from principal investing decreased 20 million other income also declined 43 million primarily due to gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by increases of 34 million in mortgage servicing fees 27 million in cards and payments income and 18 million in trust and investment services income 

noninterest income for 2012 increased 168 million from 2011 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 103 million operating lease income and other leasing gains increased 38 million primarily due to the early terminations of leveraged leases trust and investment services income increased 22 million other income also increased 55 million primarily due to gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities these increases were partially offset by decreases in corporate services income of 29 million and cards and payments income of 28 million 

  

figure 7 noninterest income 

 

  

 figure 8 dealer trading and derivatives income loss 

 

  

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services income is our largest source of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions trust and asset management commissions and insurance income the assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in figure 9 for 2013 trust and investment services income increased 18 million or 48 from the prior year for 2012 trust and investment services income increased 22 million or 62 from the prior year 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2013 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 369 billion compared to 347 billion at december 31 2012 and 343 billion at december 31 2011 as shown in figure 9 increases in the equity and securities lending portfolios from 2012 to 2013 were primarily attributable to market appreciation these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the fixed income portfolio as the market value of this portfolio declined increases in the equity fixed income and 

  

money market portfolios from 2011 to 2012 were mostly offset by a decrease in the securities lending portfolio our securities lending business declined from 2011 to 2012 we reduced emphasis on this business which resulted in lower transaction volumes client departures and fewer assets under management 

figure 9 assets under management 

 

 investment banking and debt placement fees 

investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees debt and equity financing fees financial advisor fees gains on sales of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees in 2013 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 6 million or 18 from one year ago in 2012 investment banking and debt placement fees increased 103 million or 46 from 2011 primarily due to increased levels of debt and equity financings and advisor fees 

operating lease income and other leasing gains 

operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased 87 million during 2013 and increased 38 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to gains on the early terminations of leveraged leases product runoff also contributed to the decrease from 2012 to 2013 accordingly as shown in figure 10 operating lease expense also declined from 2012 to 2013 

cards and payments income 

cards and payments income which consists of debit card consumer and commercial credit card and merchant services income increased 27 million or 20 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased 28 million or 172 from 2011 to 2012 the increase from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition the decrease from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect october 1 2011 

consumer mortgage income 

consumer mortgage income decreased 21 million or 525 from 2012 to 2013 and increased 8 million or 25 from 2011 to 2012 the decrease from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower mortgage originations 

mortgage servicing fees 

mortgage servicing fees increased 34 million or 1417 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased 2 million or 77 from 2011 to 2012 the increase in mortgage servicing fees from 2012 to 2013 was due to higher levels of core servicing fees and special servicing fees as a result of the 2013 acquisition of a commercial mortgage servicing portfolio 

other income 

other income which consists primarily of gain on sale of certain loans other service charges and certain dealer trading income decreased 43 million or 387 from 2012 to 2013 and increased 55 million or 982 from 2011 to 2012 other income was higher in 2012 than it was in 2011 or 2013 due to a 54 million gain on the redemption of trust preferred securities 

  

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 10 noninterest expense for 2013 was 28 billion up 2 million or 1 from 2012 in 2013 expenses attributable to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolios and western new york branches increased 40 million and we recognized 117 million of expenses related to our efficiency initiative and a pension settlement charge noninterest expense increased by 134 million or 5 from 2011 to 2012 of which 61 million was attributable to the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolios and western new york branches and 25 million was attributable to our efficiency initiative 

as shown in figure 11 personnel expense increased by 39 million in 2013 driven by higher levels of incentive compensation employee benefits and severance expense partially offset by declines in stockbased compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 37 million primarily due to declines in several expense categories 39 million in business services and professional fees 17 million in marketing 11 million in other expense and 10 million in operating lease expense these declines in nonpersonnel expense were partially offset by increases of 24 million in provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 21 in intangible asset amortization and 15 million in net occupancy costs 

personnel expense increased by 110 million in 2012 driven by higher levels of expense in each category shown in figure 11 nonpersonnel expense increased 24 million primarily due to increases in several expense categories 19 million in intangible asset amortization 12 million in the provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 30 million in other expense 8 million in marketing and 7 million in business services and professional fees these increases in nonpersonnel expense were partially offset by a 37 million decrease in operating lease expense due to product runoff and a 21 million decrease in the fdic assessment 

figure 10 noninterest expense 

 

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 11 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 39 million or 25 from 2012 to 2013 incentive compensation increased 28 million severance expense and employee benefits increased 15 million and 12 million respectively as a result of staff reductions related to our efficiency initiative employee benefits included a 27 million pension settlement charge these increases in personnel expense were partially offset by a decrease of 14 million in stockbased compensation 

  

personnel expense increased 110 million from 2011 to 2012 due to several factors salaries increased 40 million due to increased hiring of clientfacing personnel including our acquisition of 37 branches in western new york and increases in base salaries technology contract labor net increased 34 million due to higher levels of contract labor for technology investments attributable to the credit card portfolio acquisitions and the related implementation of new payment systems and merchant services processing employee benefits increased 14 million primarily due to pension expense and higher medical claims incentive compensation increased 12 million as a result of higher commission expenses driven by increased activity in debt and equity placements stockbased compensation also increased 8 million while severance expense increased 2 million 

figure 11 personnel expense 

 

  

 operating lease expense 

the decrease in operating lease expense in both 2013 and 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains” 

fdic assessment 

fdic assessment expense declined 1 million or 32 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased 21 million or 404 from 2011 to 2012 the decline from 2011 to 2012 was a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments 

intangible asset amortization 

intangible asset amortization increased 21 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and 19 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increases are a result of the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and western new york branches 

other expense 

other expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items other expense declined 11 million from 2012 to 2013 due to fluctuations in several of those line items other expense increased 30 million from 2011 to 2012 which included 14 million in recurring expenses associated with the acquisitions of the credit card portfolios and western new york branches 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 271 million for 2013 compared to a tax provision of 231 million for 2012 and 364 million for 2011 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 237 for 2013 compared to 214 for 2012 and 274 for 2011 

  

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves in addition in 2013 and 2012 our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs 

we recorded a valuation allowance of 1 million and 3 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards

 key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 13 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 151 million for 2013 compared to 129 million for 2012 and 191 million for 2011 the increase in 2013 was primarily due to key’s efficiency initiative 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 47 million or 32 from 2012 average loans and leases grew 21 billion or 78 while average deposits increased by 11 billion or 22 compared to 2012 the positive contribution to net interest income from loan and deposit growth was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2013 compared to one year ago 

  

noninterest income increased by 13 million or 17 from 2012 trust and investment services income increased 17 million due to an increase in assets under management resulting from market appreciation and increased production cards and payments income increased 26 million due to the full year impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition in 2012 these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a 21 million decrease in consumer mortgage income primarily due to lower originations and a 5 million decline in other income 

the provision for loan and lease losses increased by 6 million or 4 from 2012 net loan chargeoffs declined 48 million or 246 from 2012 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio 

noninterest expense declined by 76 million or 41 from 2012 due to key’s efficiency initiative personnel expense decreased 21 million primarily due to declines in salaries and employee benefits nonpersonnel expense declined 55 million primarily due to decreases in business services and professional fees computer processing and other support costs 

key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 129 million for 2012 compared to net income of 191 million for 2011 taxableequivalent net interest income increased by 16 million or 11 from 2011 average loans and leases grew 16 billion or 63 while average deposits increased by 1 billion or 21 compared to 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 61 million to net interest income 454 million to average loans and leases and 932 million to deposits the positive contribution to net interest income from the acquisitions was offset by the impact of lower value on deposits driven by the prolonged low rate environment noninterest income increased by 3 million or 4 from 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 25 million mainly in credit card fees brokerage commissions and service charges on deposit accounts trust and investment services income increased 12 million primarily due to an increase in assets under management resulting from market appreciation and increased production these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a 26 million decline in cards and payment income resulting from government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect october 1 2011 the provision for loan and lease losses increased by 2 million or 14 from 2011 net loan chargeoffs declined 79 million or 288 from 2011 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in credit quality of the portfolio noninterest expense increased by 116 million or 66 from 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 62 million to the increase in noninterest expense spread across several expense categories including personnel loan servicing and intangible amortization

 key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14 key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 444 million for 2013 compared to 409 million for 2012 and 554 million for 2011 the 2013 increase was driven by an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by a decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense 

taxableequivalent net interest income decreased by 14 million or 18 in 2013 compared to 2012 the decline was driven by a 15 million or 65 decrease in the deposit spread as the decline in rates due to the continued lowrate environment offset a 31 billion increase in deposit balances the earning asset spread increased 16 million or 33 from 2012 as increased earning asset balances of 16 billion or 76 were partially offset by a decrease in the spread rate year over year 

noninterest income increased by 31 million or 41 from 2012 this increase was driven by a 33 million increase in mortgage servicing fees related to increases in core mortgage servicing fees special servicing fees and investments in commercial mortgage servicing in addition there was an 11 million increase in gains realized on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and a 9 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees these increases were partially offset by a 20 million decrease in operating lease income and other leasing gains 

the provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of 6 million in 2013 compared to a charge of 24 million in 2012 the 2013 credit was driven by improved credit quality within the portfolio as the quality of new business volume exceeded that of the legacy portfolio net loan chargeoffs decreased from 64 million in 2012 to 1 million in 2013 

noninterest expense increased by 8 million or 9 from 2012 this increase was driven by a 7 million charge in the provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments for 2013 compared to a credit of 17 million 

  

for 2012 and an increase in personnel expense these increases were partially offset by decreases in operating lease expense due to product runoff net oreo expense and other expense categories 

the 2012 decline in net income from continuing operations attributable to key compared to 2011 resulted from increases in the provision for loan and lease losses and noninterest expense partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income taxableequivalent net interest income increased by 13 million or 17 in 2012 compared to 2011 as a reduction in the value of deposits due to historically low interest rates was offset by increases in both deposit balances and earning assets noninterest income increased 9 million or 12 as increases in investment banking and debt placement fees were partially offset by decreases in operating lease income and other leasing gains due to product runoff loan fees and gains on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business and changes in the derivative reserve the provision for loan and lease losses increased 222 million due to a charge of 24 million taken in 2012 compared to a credit of 198 million in 2011 noninterest expense increased 21 million or 25 driven by higher corporate overhead net oreo expenses recorded in 2012 versus net oreo gains in 2011 and increases in personnel expense these expenses were partially offset by decreases in operating lease expense due to product runoff and declines in other expense categories

other segments 

other segments consists of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios other segments generated net income attributable to key of 314 million for 2013 compared to 256 million for 2012 the 2013 results reflect an increase in taxableequivalent net interest income of 127 million compared to 2012 the provision for loan and lease losses for 2013 was a credit of 21 million compared to a charge of 55 million for 2012 these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income of 154 million 

in 2012 other segments generated net income attributable to key of 256 million compared to 209 million for 2011 the 2012 results reflected a 137 million increase in noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of 22 million and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of 60 million

 at december 31 2013 total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 545 billion compared to 528 billion at the end of 2012 and 496 billion at the end of 2011 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 45 billion at december 31 2013 52 billion at december 31 2012 and 58 billion at december 31 2011 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section titled “consumer loan portfolio” within this discussion the increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past year results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial financial and agricultural portfolio along with the credit card portfolio and western new york branch acquisitions for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 383 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 14 billion or 39 compared to december 31 2012 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 15 our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represent 458 and 440 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and are the largest component of our total loans the loans consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans increased 17 billion or 74 from one year ago growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio is primarily attributable to increased loans to clients in the manufacturing technology and healthcare industries additionally we are increasing loans to real estate investment trust “reit” clients and institutionallybacked commercial real estate “cre” funds reits and institutional cre funds effectively enable us to lend to entities that generally have more diverse cash flows lower debt levels and better access to the capital markets than private owners or developers 

figure 16 commercial financial and agricultural loans 

 

 commercial financial and agricultural loans increased 17 billion or 74 from the same period last year with key corporate bank increasing 16 billion and key community bank up 98 million we have experienced 

  

growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and as well as in our institutional and capital markets business our two largest industry classifications — services and manufacturing — increased by 76 and 10 respectively when compared to one year ago the services and manufacturing industries represented 242 and 170 respectively of the total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio at december 31 2013 compared to 241 and 181 respectively at december 31 2012 at the end of each period provided in figure 16 above loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for over 40 of our total commercial financial and agricultural loan portfolio 

services manufacturing and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge our loans in the services classification grew by 426 million or 76 compared to last year the growth in the services loan portfolio was largely related to increases in lending to large corporate middle market and business banking clients and was partially offset by decreases in loans to clients in private bank and real estate loans in the manufacturing classification grew by 42 million or 10 compared to the same period one year ago increases in lending to large corporate middle market and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification loans in the public utilities classification grew by 414 million or 291 compared to last year 

commercial real estate loans cre loans represent 162 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2013 compared to 165 one year ago these cre loans including both owner and nonowneroccupied properties represented 230 of our commercial loan portfolio at december 31 2013 compared to 237 one year ago these loans have increased 90 million or 10 to 88 billion at december 31 2013 from 87 billion at december 31 2012 our cre lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 12state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of cre located both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 558 of our average yeartodate cre loans compared to 543 one year ago keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of cre 

figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as shown in figure 17 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral 

as presented in figure 17 at december 31 2013 our cre portfolio included mortgage loans of 77 billion and construction loans of 11 billion representing 142 and 20 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represented 108 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represented 54 of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2013 was 37 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2013 had a balance of 1013 million at december 31 2013 our average construction loan commitment was 60 million our largest construction loan commitment was 580 million and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was 557 million 

also shown in figure 17 at december 31 2013 666 of our cre loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 640 at december 31 2012 approximately 159 and 149 of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments a significant decline in economic growth and in turn in rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans 

  

figure 17 commercial real estate loans 

 

  

 during 2013 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 104 million from 127 million at december 31 2012 to 23 million at december 31 2013 as a result of continued improvement in asset quality and market conditions this category of loans declined by 47 million during 2012 

since december 31 2012 our nonowneroccupied cre portfolio has increased by approximately 287 million or 51 as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 

if the economic recovery stalls it may weaken the cre market fundamentals ie vacancy rates the stability of rental income and asset values leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments accordingly the value of cre loan portfolio could be adversely affected 

commercial lease financing we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our key equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 119 of commercial loans at december 31 2013 and 133 at december 31 2012 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

  

our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions forgiveness of principal and other modifications loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

if loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a tdr during 2013 there were 69 million of new restructured commercial loans 

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 5 “asset quality” 

figure 18 commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status 

 

 we often use an ab note structure for our tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches first we create an a note since the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in longterm markets and “takeout underwriting standards” of our various lines of business appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification moreover the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically cre the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction and local markets are spared distressedfire sales 

the b note typically is an interestonly note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the a note we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current welldocumented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we wait a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to 

  

accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractuallyrequired interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

all loans processed as tdrs including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 

additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 5 “asset quality” 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but sometimes they are modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for both the client and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 

we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the high level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and near term debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

as of december 31 2013 we had 34 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 and were accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to 

  

one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding increased by 188 million or 12 from one year ago the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 969 of this portfolio at december 31 2013 is originated from key community bank within our 12state footprint the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans in key community bank increased by 524 million or 53 over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values improved employment and favorable borrowing conditions 

as shown in figure 13 we hold the first lien position for approximately 58 of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2013 and 55 at december 31 2012 for consumer loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratio this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively and therefore prior periods were not adjusted at december 31 2013 42 of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages on at least a quarterly basis we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate 

figure 19 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five years as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole

 loans held for sale 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale were 611 million at december 31 2013 compared to 599 million at december 31 2012 during 2013 we recorded net gains 

  

losses from loan sales of 125 million on the income statement there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31 2013 and 2012 

at december 31 2013 loans held for sale included 307 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by 170 million from december 31 2012 278 million of commercial financial and agricultural loans which increased 249 million from december 31 2012 17 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by 68 million from december 31 2012 and 9 million of commercial lease financing which increased 1 million from december 31 2012 valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets including credit spreads treasury rates interest rate curves and risk profiles as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios we review our assumptions quarterly for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale see note 6 “fair value measurements” 

loan sales 

as shown in figure 20 during 2013 we sold 41 billion of cre loans 840 million of residential real estate loans and 275 million of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio additionally there were 147 million of education loans sold included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet 

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are

figure 21 loans administered or serviced 

 

  

  

 in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 14 billion of the 179 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2013 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of cre loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

figure 22 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2013 approximately 274 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year

 securities 

our securities portfolio totaled 171 billion at december 31 2013 compared to 16 billion at december 31 2012 availableforsale securities were 123 billion at december 31 2013 compared to 121 billion at 

  

december 31 2012 heldtomaturity securities were 48 billion at december 31 2013 compared to 39 billion at december 31 2012 essentially all of our heldtomaturity securities portfolio was invested in cmos at december 31 2013 

as shown in figure 23 all of our mortgagebacked securities which include both securities available for sale and heldtomaturity securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in liquid secondary markets these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the availableforsale portfolio and at cost for the heldtomaturity portfolio for more information about these securities see note 6 “fair value measurements” under the heading “qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques” and note 7 “securities” 

figure 23 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 

 

  

 securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of cmos which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities cmos generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements at december 31 2013 we had 123 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 12 billion at december 31 2012 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

throughout 2012 and 2013 our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities as well as the western new york branch acquisition in july 2012 including credit card assets obtained in september 2012 and the acquisition of keybranded credit card assets in august 2012

 other investments 

principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 571 of other investments at december 31 2013 they include direct investments 

  

investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privatelyheld companies and are carried at fair value the fair value of the direct investments was 141 million at december 31 2013 and 191 million at december 31 2012 while the fair value of the indirect investments was 413 million at december 31 2013 and 436 million at december 31 2012 under the requirements of the volcker rule we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments the implementation date of the volcker rule is july 21 2015 key is permitted to file for two oneyear extensions and an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time we plan to apply for the extensions and hold the investments as of december 31 2013 we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain real estaterelated investments that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost there are indirect realestaterelated investments valued at 23 million at december 31 2013 and 41 million at december 31 2012 that may be subject to the disposal requirements under the volcker rule as described in the previous paragraph 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information this review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry thirdparty data and other relevant factors during 2013 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 52 million which includes 8 million of net unrealized gains these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

deposits and other sources of funds 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding during 2013 average domestic deposits were 653 billion and represented 866 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 611 billion and 850 during 2012 the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled “net interest income” 

the increase in average domestic deposits from 2012 to 2013 was driven by corporate clients and the addition of escrow deposits from our commercial mortgaging servicing business acquisition resulting in increases in demand deposits of 28 billion and interestbearing nontime deposits of 35 billion improved funding mix and maturities of our certificates of deposit have reduced the cost of total domestic deposits which is down from 2012 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 28 billion during 2013 compared to 30 billion during 2012 the change from 2012 was caused by a 200 million decrease in foreign office deposits a 19 million decrease in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings and a 12 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

at december 31 2013 key had 32 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

 capital 

at december 31 2013 our shareholders’ equity was 103 billion up 32 million from december 31 2012 the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity 

ccar and capital actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires bhcs like keycorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the bhc’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions as previously reported on january 7 2013 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ our 2013 capital plan under the annual ccar process on march 14 2013 the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan at its march 2013 meeting our board authorized up to 426 million of common share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions subsequently we received no objection from the federal reserve to use and our board approved the use of the cash portion of the net aftertax gain from the sale of victory approximately 72 million for additional common share repurchases 

through the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed 409 million of common share repurchases on the open market under our 2013 capital plan in the first quarter of 2013 we completed 65 million of common share repurchases on the open market under our 2012 capital plan common share repurchases under the 2013 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2014 

dividends 

consistent with the 2013 capital plan we made a dividend payment of 055 per share or 49 million on our common shares during each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2013 and a dividend payment of 05 per common share or 47 million during the first quarter of 2013 changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the board of directors based upon our earnings financial condition and other factors including regulatory review further information regarding the capital planning process and ccar is included in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report under the heading “regulatory capital and liquidity” 

during 2013 we also made four quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share or 575 million on our series a preferred stock 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 30418 holders of record at december 31 2013 our book value per common share was 1125 based on 8907 million shares outstanding at december 31 2013 compared to 1078 based on 9258 million shares outstanding at december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 our tangible book value per common share was 1011 compared to 967 at december 31 2012

 at december 31 2013 we had 1262 million treasury shares compared to 912 million treasury shares at december 31 2012 during 2013 common shares outstanding decreased by 35 million shares from share repurchases under our 2012 and 2013 capital plans and the net activity in our employee benefit plans going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

as discussed in further detail in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth planned capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management intend to make during the year subject to the federal reserve’s notice of nonobjection pursuant to that requirement we have submitted to the federal reserve for review our 2014 capital plan 

  

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2013 our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described under the heading “regulatory capital and liquidity” in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1109 at december 31 2013 compared to 1151 at december 31 2012 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 980 at december 31 2013 compared to 1015 at december 31 2012 

banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bhcs like keycorp and their banking subsidiaries riskbased capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “riskweighted assets” riskweighted assets consist of total assets plus certain offbalance sheet and market risk items subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors currently banks and bhcs must maintain at a minimum tier 1 capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 400 and total capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 800 as of december 31 2013 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio and our total riskbased capital ratios were 1196 and 1433 respectively compared to 1215 and 1513 respectively at december 31 2012 

another indicator of capital adequacy the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskadjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 300 all other bhcs must maintain a minimum ratio of 400 as of december 31 2013 our leverage ratio was 1111 compared to 1141 at december 31 2012 

the adoption of the regulatory capital rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital the phaseout period beginning january 1 2015 for standardized approaches banking organizations such as key will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital by 2016 these changes apply the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs savings and loan holding companies and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the capital framework established under the regulatory capital rules by our compliance date of january 1 2015 the section titled “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report contains more detailed information regarding the regulatory capital rules 

as of december 31 2013 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were 1196 1111 and 1433 respectively the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute 339 million or 41 38 and 41 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio respectively as of december 31 2013 the new minimum capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated capital ratios of key at december 31 2013 calculated on a fully phasedin basis are set forth under the heading “new minimum capital requirements” in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 of this report 

federal banking regulations group fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” a “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 600 for tier 1 riskbased capital 500 for tier 1 leverage capital and 1000 for total riskbased capital and must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure if these provisions applied to bhcs we believe we would qualify as “well capitalized” at december 31 2013 and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category analysis on an estimated basis accounting for the phaseout of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible and therefore as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2013 also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under 

  

current regulatory guidelines basel i with the estimated tier 1 riskbased capital ratio estimated leverage ratio and estimated total riskbased capital ratio being 1156 1073 and 1433 respectively the “revised prompt corrective action standards” section in the “supervision and regulation” section of item 1 of this report describes the new threshold capital ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the regulatory capital rules the regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “regulatory capital and liquidity” in “supervision and regulation” under item 1 of this report 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations as a result of the financial crisis the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies including keycorp the capital modifications mandated by the regulatory capital rules are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks bhcs and covered nonbank financial companies which resulted from the financial crisis tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4 in the “highlights of our 2013performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to tier 1 common equity the corresponding nongaap measure our tier 1 common equity ratio was 1122 at december 31 2013 compared to 1136 at december 31 2012 

generally for riskbased capital purposes deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarterend date based on its projected future taxable income for the year or ii 10 of the amount of an institution’s tier 1 capital at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier 1 capital and riskweighted assets at december 31 2013 for key’s consolidated operations we had a federal net deferred tax asset of 184 million and a state deferred tax asset of 7 million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of 83 million and a state deferred tax liability of 13 million at december 31 2012 we have recorded a valuation allowance of 1 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 11 “variable interest entities” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2013 is presented in note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support 

  

provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 20 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 30 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2013 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 30 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

  

 guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 20 under the heading “guarantees” 

  

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit liquidity market compliance operational strategic and reputation risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the keycorp board of directors the “board” serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the board’s audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal compliance independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and all risk review functions including internal audit the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance the audit committee has responsibility over financial reporting compliance risk and legal matters the implementation management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information security and fraud risk and associated reputation and strategic risks 

the board’s risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies policies procedures and practices relating to the management of credit risk market risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk including the actions taken to mitigate these risks as well as reputational and strategic risks the risk committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital reviews the enterprise risk management erm reports and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprised of other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the board’s risk committee annually the board reviews and approves the erm program as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments membership of the risk governance committees includes representatives from each of the three lines of defense the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating analyzing and reporting risk information risk review provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness appropriateness and adherence to keycorp’s risk management policies practices and controls 

  

the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions ensures appropriate ownership of risks provides input into performance and compensation decisions assesses aggregate enterprise risk monitors capabilities to manage critical risks and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce key’s income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline when market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 

we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which includes asset and liability management activities our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement these positions are subject to various marketbased risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings are nontrading positions these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions primarily changes in interest rates 

trading market risk 

key incurs market risk as a result of trading investing and client facilitation activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets business key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

management of trading market risks  market risk management is an integral part of key’s risk culture oversight of trading market risks is governed by the risk committee of our board the erm committee and the market risk committee collectively the “committees” market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier 2 risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment the committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our market risk management group “mrm” that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities 

mrm is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify measure and monitor market risks throughout our company mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses mrm conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management 

  

covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account the trading account includes on and offbalance sheet positions in financial instruments acquired with the intent to profit from price variations all positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “fair value measurements” and note 6 “fair value measurements” in this report instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee 

our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios 

 

  

  

  

 var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations 

we use a historical var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a 95 confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99 confidence level two years of historical data were used in the simulation during 2012 beginning in february 2013 the simulation uses historical data from the previous year as we believe it more appropriately reflects the current market conditions and the risks associated with our portfolios this change resulted in a decrease in var exposure of approximately 2 at the 95 confidence level and 15 at the 99 confidence level we also utilize factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions 

  

the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key’s risk management group on an annual basis the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee 

mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the 99 confidence level to observed daily profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var actual losses did not exceed daily trading var on any day during the quarters ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 

we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives 

the aggregate var at the 99 confidence level for all covered positions was 10 million at december 31 2013 and 12 million at december 31 2012 the decrease in aggregate var was primarily due to reduced exposures in credit derivatives as well as the change from using two years of historical data to one year for the var simulation which was partially offset by an increase in fixed income var figure 31 summarizes our var at the 99 confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

figure 31 var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

 stressed var is calculated using our general var results at the 99 confidence level and applying certain assumptions the aggregate stressed var for all covered positions was 29 million at december 31 2013 figure 32 summarizes our stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31 2013 as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes stressed var was not calculated for market risk regulatory capital purposes during 2012 

figure 32 stressed var for significant portfolios of covered positions 

 

   

internal capital adequacy assessment market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset position which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors specific risk is measured through a standardized approach for positions where the var model does not capture specific risk specific risk calculations are run quarterly by mrm and approved by the chief market risk officer 

nontrading market risk 

most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the risk committee of our board the erm committee and the alco these committees review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis the market risk management group as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

 

  

  

  

 net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected 

  

composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments including a most likely macroeconomic scenario simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 

we measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next twelve months and term rates were to move in a similar fashion our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points but due to the low interest rate environment we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including a sustained flat yield curve an inverted slope yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance shifts investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2013 and 2012 at december 31 2013 our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in shortterm or intermediateterm interest rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 as shown in figure 33 we are operating within these levels 

figure 33 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 the results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results 

  

presented in figure 33 net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts the unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates the sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 75 basis point range of modeled results 

to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the fomc expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens and in particular expects to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase prior to any increase in the federal funds rate our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelvemonth horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve twentyfour and thirtysix month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 34 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities”

 liquidity risk management 

we define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the risk committee of our board the erm committee and the alco collectively the “committees” the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the market risk management group as the second line of defense provides additional oversight 

these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

our credit ratings at december 31 2013 are shown in figure 35 we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

  

figure 35 credit ratings 

 

 managing liquidity risk 

most of our liquidity risk is derived from our lending activities which inherently places funds into illiquid assets liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences these assessments are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits 

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2013 totaled 116 billion consisting of 60 billion of unpledged securities 10 billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and 46 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2013 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 155 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 25 billion at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati in 2013 key’s outstanding fhlb advances decreased by 750 million due to repayment of advances 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to 

  

execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loan to deposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2013 our loan to deposit ratio was 84 which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 18 “longterm debt” that enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions during 2013 both keycorp and keybank issued debt under these programs these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board of directors and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

in 2013 key’s aggregate outstanding note balance net of unamortized discounts and adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial instruments increased by 15 billion on february 1 2013 keybank issued 1 billion of 165 senior bank notes due february 1 2018 under its global bank note program on november 26 2013 keybank issued 350 million of 110 senior bank notes and 400 million of floating rate senior notes each due november 25 2016 on november 13 2013 keycorp issued 750 million of 230 mediumterm notes due december 13 2018 in 2013 750 million of keycorp’s mediumterm notes matured 

liquidity for keycorp 

the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use a cash coverage metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the cash coverage metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity to meet all projected obligations we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months at december 31 2013 keycorp held 25 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance 

typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year 

  

up to the date of dividend declaration during 2013 keybank paid keycorp 600 million in dividends while the nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent keycorp did not make any cash capital infusions to keybank during 2013 as of december 31 2013 keybank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to keycorp

over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities growth in deposits related to the acquisition of the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and special servicing business and net customer loan and deposit flows the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution the issuance of 1 billion of senior bank notes in february 2013 750 million of senior bank notes in november 2013 and 750 million of parent mediumterm notes in november 2013 provided additional liquidity to support normal business flows and maintain our liquid asset portfolio within target levels 

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 236 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2013 as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 16 million in taxes to be paid if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately 31 million accordingly we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2013 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 

  

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 16 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2013 we had four client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these four individual net obligor commitments was 56 million at december 31 2013 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk we utilize credit default swaps to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2013 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 689 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity at december 31 2013 we had sold credit default swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of 55 million 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income 

we may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2013 the alll was 848 million or 156 of loans compared to 888 million or 168 at december 31 2012 the allowance includes 42 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 358 million at december 31 2013 compared to 35 million that was allocated for impaired loans of 411 million one year ago for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2013 the alll was 1669 of nonperforming loans compared to 1318 at december 31 2012 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 36 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

  

figure 36 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

  

  

 we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly our general allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies including underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 

for all commercial and consumer loan tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of 25 million and greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate we estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and tdrs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price secured consumer loan balances of tdrs that are discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell other consumer loan tdrs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full on at least a quarterly basis we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses the alll at december 31 2013 represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

as shown in figure 37 our alll decreased by 40 million or 5 during the past twelve months this contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio the quality of new loan originations and decreasing npls and net loan chargeoffs has resulted in a reduction in our general allowance our delinquency trends have declined during 2013 due to a modest level of loan growth relatively stable economic conditions and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio reflecting our effort to maintain a moderate enterprise risk tolerance our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments increased by 8 million to 37 million at december 31 2013 compared to the same period one year ago when combined with our alll our total allowance for credit losses represented 163 of loans at december 31 2013 compared to 174 at december 31 2012 

  

figure 37 allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

  

 our provision credit for loan and lease losses was 130 million for 2013 compared to 229 million for 2012 our net loan chargeoffs were 168 million for 2013 compared to 345 million for 2012 our net loan chargeoffs for 2012 included 33 million of chargeoffs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans and leases discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be chargedoff to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency additionally we continue to reduce our exit loans and leases as well as our exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net loan chargeoffs we anticipate that net loan chargeoffs will remain at or below the lower end of our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points of average loans for the balance of the current year 

  

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2013 totaled 168 million or 32 of average loans compared to net loan chargeoffs of 345 million or 69 for the same period last year our 2012 net loan chargeoffs included 33 million of incremental net loan chargeoffs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency status in addition we incurred 13 million of net loan chargeoffs related to our two acquisitions completed in 2012 figure 38 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 39 

over the past twelve months net loan chargeoffs decreased 177 million this decrease is attributable to continued improvement in asset quality statistics as shown in figure 36 as well as the classification of certain loans from updated regulatory guidance that went into effect for us during the second half of 2012 as shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of 17 million in net loan chargeoffs for 2013 net loan chargeoffs for 2012 in our exit loan portfolio were 78 million the decrease in net loan chargeoffs in our exit loan portfolio were primarily driven by lower levels of nonperforming loans and continued run off in the consumer exit loan portfolios

as shown in figure 40 nonperforming assets decreased during 2013 having declined for the past four years most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio and nonperforming loans held for sale as shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 56 million or 11 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2013 compared to 83 million or 11 at december 31 2012 

at december 31 2013 the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 57 of their original contractual amount owed total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 72 of their contractual amount owed and total nonperforming assets represented 70 of their original contractual amount owed at the same date oreo represented 46 of its original contractual amount owed while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 38 of their contractual amount owed 

at december 31 2013 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 86 million representing 17 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations compared to 179 million representing 27 in the prior year 

figure 41 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 the net loan chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of those loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 4 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2013 compared to 5 at december 31 2012 additional information about loan sales is included in the “loans and loans held for sale” section under “loan sales”

 operational risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation 

  

due to their systemic importance this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee a senior management committee oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committee’s oversight of these controls 

cybersecurity 

key devotes significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating its technology systems and processes to protect the security of its computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage key and many other us financial institutions have experienced distributed denialofservice attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions key also periodically experiences other attempts to breach the security of its systems and data these cyberattacks have not to date resulted in any material disruption of key’s operations material harm to key customers and have not had a material adverse effect on key’s results of operations 

cyberattack risks may also occur with key’s third party technology service providers and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to key with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect key’s financial condition or results of operations recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of key we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by key and our clients 

  

fourth quarter results 

figure 45 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2013 are summarized below 

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 229 million or 26 per common share compared to 190 million or 20 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2012 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we incurred 24 million or 02 per common share of costs related to our previously announced efficiency initiative and a pension settlement charge fourth quarter 2013 net income attributable to key common shareholders was 224 million compared to 197 million for the same quarter one year ago 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 108 compared to 96 for the fourth quarter of 2012 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 910 for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 758 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 589 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and the net interest margin was 301 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 607 million and a net interest margin of 337 for the fourth quarter of 2012 the decrease in net interest income and net interest margin is attributable to the impact of lower interest rates on asset yields combined with a significant increase in liquidity levels resulting from strong deposit inflows the decreases were partially offset by the maturity of higherrate certificates of deposit and a more favorable mix of lowercost deposits 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 453 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 439 million for the yearago quarter the fourth quarter reflects the benefits from key’s recent investments in payments and commercial mortgage servicing with cards and payments income up 2 million and mortgage servicing fees up 15 million in addition net gains from principal investing increased 18 million these increases were partially offset by decreases in investment banking and debt placement fees of 26 million and consumer mortgage income of 8 million 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 712 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 734 million for the same period last year excluding the 22 million in expenses related to our efficiency initiative and the pension settlement charge of 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the 16 million in efficiency initiative expenses one year ago noninterest expense was down 30 million from the prior year personnel expense decreased 24 million due to the realization of expense efficiencies nonpersonnel expense increased 2 million the provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments increased 11 million offset by a 12 million decrease in business services and professional fees 

provision for loan and lease losses 

our provision for loan and lease losses was 19 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 57 million for the yearago quarter our alll was 848 million or 156 of total periodend loans at december 31 2013 compared to 888 million or 168 at december 31 2012 

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2013 totaled 37 million or 27 of average loans compared to 58 million or 44 for the same period last year 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 70 million compared to a tax provision of 53 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 23 compared with 213 for the same quarter one year ago for the fourth quarter of 2013 the tax rate was higher due to higher pretax income and slightly lower tax credits earned during the period

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions underwriting standards and concentrations of credit other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balances of 25 million and greater we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the alll when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many 

  

respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the alll to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2013 would indicate the need for a 16 million increase in the allowance the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 38 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 10 million or 01 per common share a 38 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 24 million or 03 per common share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the alll would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2013 145 billion or 156 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2013 13 billion or 15 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

  

at december 31 2013 30 million or 1 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis all of these assets were classified as level 3 at december 31 2013 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 554 million at december 31 2013 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2013 earnings by approximately 55 million 35 million after tax or 04 per common share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” accounting guidance that was effective for us on january 1 2012 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2013 therefore the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill because the strength of the economic recovery remained uncertain during 2013 we continued to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly the acquisition of 37 retail banking branches in western new york resulted in a 62 million increase in the goodwill at the key community bank unit at december 31 2013 the key community bank reporting unit had 979 million in goodwill while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill additional information is provided in note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 16 “employee benefits” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2013 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

  

derivatives and hedging 

we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 20 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 20 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2013 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

during 2013 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

acquisitions and divestitures 

the information presented in note 13 “acquisitions and discontinued operations” is incorporated herein by reference 

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive key competes with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures the financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation continued during 2012 and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial institutions including through the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” leastcost resolution process albeit at a far slower pace than 2011 and 2010 financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and other resolutions and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 300 banks that failed between 2010 and 2012 representing 1386 billion in total assets were redistributed through the fdic’s leastcost resolution process 

supervision and regulation 

the following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks and provides certain specific information regarding material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the dif and the banking system as a whole rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing resulting from enactment of the doddfrank act we cannot predict changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies yet such changes may have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and access to liquidity or credit 

general 

as a bhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca under the bhca bhcs may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

  

under the doddfrank act and federal reserve policy a bhc is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when we may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of a bankruptcy any commitment by a bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

federal law also establishes a system of prudential and functional federal regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their affiliates are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators such as the occ for national banks and federal savings associations the fdic for nonmember state banks and savings associations the federal reserve for member state banks the cfpb for federal consumer financial laws and consumer financial products or services the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities the sec and cftc for swaps and other derivatives and state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2012 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and two national bank subsidiaries that are limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and doddfrank act 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

regulatory reform developments 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank act became law it was intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the us reduce the risks of bank failures better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of bank and nonbank sifis such as keycorp and keybank the following provides a summary of relevant regulatory developments relating to the doddfrank act 

consumer financial protection bureau 

title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb as a new consumer financial services regulator we are now subject to supervision regulation and examination by the cfpb the cfpb supervises banks and their affiliates such as key with assets of more than 10 billion for compliance with federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates consumer financial products and services sold by banks and nonbank companies and has rule making authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to our consumer businesses in addition we may face potential enforcement actions by the cfpb and civil actions by state attorneys general for violation of various state and federal consumer protection laws 

  

on january 10 2013 the cfpb issued its final rule to implement sections of the doddfrank act that will require lenders to verify a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan the rule establishes certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations and establishes certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of “qualified mortgages” the final rule becomes effective on january 10 2014 we are currently analyzing the final rule in order to determine its impact on key’s mortgage lending business 

the cfpb issued its final rules on january 17 2013 to implement sections of the doddfrank act addressing certain obligations of mortgage servicers to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers and to provide certain information requested by such borrowers the final rules also impose requirements on a mortgage servicer in connection with the force placement of collateral insurance mandate certain notices prior to rate adjustments on adjustablerate mortgages and establish requirements for periodic disclosures to borrowers these rules will apply directly to key and to any thirdparty mortgage servicer engaged by key and become effective on january 10 2014 

financial stability oversight council 

title i of the doddfrank act created the fsoc as a new systemic risk oversight body to identify monitor and address potential threats to us financial stability we are now subject to oversight and regulation by the fsoc the fsoc is responsible for identifying systemic risks promoting stronger financial regulation and identifying those nonbank companies that are systemically important and thus should be subject to regulation by the federal reserve in addition in extraordinary cases the fsoc together with the federal reserve could require the breakup of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to us financial stability 

“volcker rule” 

section 619 of the doddfrank act added new section 13 to the bhca which is referred to as the “volcker rule” the volcker rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from engaging in certain types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds key is affected by some parts of the volcker rule but the effect is uncertain until the final rule is implemented the scope of the proprietary trading prohibition and its impact on key will depend on the definitions in the final rule particularly those definitions related to statutory exemptions for riskmitigating hedging activities marketmaking and customerrelated activities in addition the final rule is expected to include restrictions on key’s private equity and hedge fund activities as of december 31 2012 our principal investments and real estate capital lines of business hold certain investments not exceeding 450 million that we expect may be subject to certain limitations under the final volcker rule under the proposed rulemaking announced on october 11 2011 we expect to be able to hold these investments until july 2014 with no restriction and be eligible to obtain up to three oneyear extension periods subject to regulatory approvals a forced sale of some of these investments could result in key receiving less value than it would otherwise have received depending on the provisions of the final volcker rule it is possible that other structures through which key conducts business but that are not typically referred to as private equity or hedge funds could be restricted with an impact that cannot yet be evaluated 

debit card interchange 

federal reserve regulation ii — debit ii — debit card interchange fees and routing — limits debit card interchange fees eliminates exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and imposes limits for restrictions on merchant discounting for the use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards the relevant portions of regulation ii became effective october 1 2011 

resolution plans 

bhcs with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress in a related rulemaking the 

  

fdic adopted a final rule on january 23 2012 requiring insured depository institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including keybank to prepare and submit a resolution plan to the fdic the initial plans for keycorp and keybank are each due december 31 2013 and updated plans must be submitted annually thereafter 

enhanced prudential standards 

on january 5 2012 the federal reserve published proposed regulation yy — enhanced prudential standards — as part of its efforts to implement enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements to be imposed upon sifis pursuant to the doddfrank act it generally applies to sifis like keycorp and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements singlecounterparty credit limits risk management supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements and early remediation as indicated below the federal reserve has finalized regulation yy only with respect to supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements 

supervisory and companyrun stress testing 

the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve to conduct an annual supervisory stress test on certain banking organizations including keycorp to evaluate whether they have sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions stress testing scenarios including those describing hypothetical baseline adverse and severely adverse economic and financial conditions were published by the federal reserve on january 28 2013 the federal reserve announced that it will release results from the supervisory stress tests conducted on keycorp and other banking organizations on march 7 2013 under the final rule we are required to consider the results of the stress test as part of our capital planning process and must update our resolution plan as the federal reserve determines appropriate based on the results of the stress test 

companyrun stress tests conducted by keycorp and keybank are also required by the doddfrank act stress testing scenarios including those describing hypothetical baseline adverse and severely adverse economic and financial conditions were published by the federal reserve and occ results of these stress tests were reported to the federal reserve and occ on january 7 2013 and will be publicly disclosed the first public disclosure is required by the rules to be made between march 15 and march 31 2013 

credit risk retention requirements 

section 941 of the doddfrank act requires the federal banking agencies and the sec to jointly prescribe regulations to require any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that the securitizer transfers to a third party through the issuance of an assetbacked security it also requires these agencies together with the fhfa and hud to jointly prescribe regulations to require any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any residential mortgage asset that the securitizer transfers to a third party through the issuance of an assetbacked security these agencies jointly proposed the required regulations in 2011 but have not yet published their final rules the rules are required to become effective for residential mortgage securitizations one year after publication of final rules and for other securitizations two years after publication of the final rules in the federal register 

the proposed rules provide a menu of numerous alternatives for meeting the risk retention requirements including some options available for any type of securitization and others specifically designed for certain asset classes they would also provide a full exemption from the risk retention requirements for securitizations backed by residential mortgages commercial loans commercial real estate loans and automobile loans meeting certain precisely specified product and underwriting criteria 

we are a significant servicer of commercial mortgages held by others including securitization vehicles we anticipate that these doddfrank act credit risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized the types of loan 

  

products made available the terms on which loans are offered consumer and business demand for loans and the need for third party loan servicers the risk retention rules themselves could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets and as a result may impact the willingness of banks including us to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements 

derivatives 

doddfrank imposes a new regulatory regime on the us derivatives markets while some of the provisions related to derivatives markets went into effect on july 16 2011 many of the new requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives the cftc and the sec one aspect of this new regulatory regime for derivatives is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the cftc which as a result will for the first time have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of our businesses although the ultimate impact will depend on the final regulations we expect that our derivatives business will likely be subject to new substantive requirements including registration with the cftc margin requirements in excess of current market practice capital requirements specific to this business real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements business conduct requirements including daily valuations disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared these requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on us and will introduce additional legal risk including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and antimanipulation provisions and private rights of action depending on the final rules that relate to our swaps businesses the nature and extent of those businesses may change 

preemption 

federal preemption and the application of state consumer protection laws to national banks is still an evolving area of the law depending on how such questions are ultimately resolved as a national bank with multistate operations and a multistate customer base keybank may experience an increase in state and local regulation of our retail banking business and additional compliance obligations revenue impacts and costs 

new assessments fees and other charges 

certain provisions of the doddfrank act require or authorize certain us governmental departments agencies and instrumentalities to collect new assessments fees and other charges from bhcs and banks like keycorp and keybank regardless of risk for example on may 21 2012 the us treasury adopted a final rule under the doddfrank act establishing an assessment schedule for sifis to collect semiannual assessments to pay the expenses of the ofr including the expenses of the fsoc and certain expenses for implementing the orderly liquidation activities of the fdic the assessment upon keycorp is based on key’s average total consolidated assets as reported in its federal reserve regulatory reports over four quarters preceding the relevant determination date key’s initial semiannual assessment of 684250 was collected on july 20 2012 similarly and although no proposals have yet been issued section 318 of the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve and authorizes the occ and fdic to charge sifis and institutions regulated by these agencies new assessments fees and other charges in connection with their examination supervision and regulation of such companies 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and the regulations adopted to implement it impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the bank’s parent bhc and certain companies in which it may have as little as a 15 equity interest or may otherwise be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a 

  

loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc victory capital advisers inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested 

provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of “affiliate” to include any “investment fund” having any bank or bhc affiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements “at all times” that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction they also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements these provisions became effective on july 21 2012 and the federal reserve has indicated that a proposed rule is expected to be released in 2013 until the federal reserve publishes final rules it will be difficult to assess the impact of these provisions of the doddfrank act 

capital 

current regulatory capital requirements 

federal banking regulators have promulgated riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to bhcs and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

under the current riskbased capital requirements keycorp and its bank subsidiaries are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which include certain offbalance sheet exposures of 8 at least half of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders’ equity excluding the over or underfunded status of postretirement benefit obligations unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges net of deferred income taxes plus certain mandatorily redeemable equity investments this is called “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt certain hybrid capital instruments qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses this is called “tier 2 capital” 

federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is currently 3 for bhcs that are considered “strong” by the federal reserve or which have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk similarly the minimum leverage ratio is currently 3 for national banks considered “strong” by the occ other bhcs and national banks must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 

pursuant to section 171 of the doddfrank act the riskbased and leverage capital standards that were in effect prior to enactment of the doddfrank act and applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions are imposed upon us bhcs like keycorp subject to a phasedin three year transition period that began on january 1 2013 one effect of this provision is to eliminate trust preferred securities at the us bhc level as an element of tier 1 capital 

  

bhcs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities that exceed specified levels are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk 

on january 1 2013 a joint final rule to implement changes to the market risk capital rule became effective replacing the rule that originally was adopted effective january 1 1997 it applies to banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank with trading assets and liabilities of at least 1 billion or 10 of total assets the rule changes the methodology for calculating the riskweighted assets related to trading assets and includes among other things the addition of a stressed var component additionally the rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions we do not currently anticipate that the changes to this rule will have a material impact on key’s or keybank’s riskweighted assets or capital ratios 

bhcs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile or growth plans at december 31 2012 key and keybank had regulatory capital in excess of all current minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements 

the fdia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a fdicinsured depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards such institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure at december 31 2012 keybank satisfied the criteria for the prompt corrective action wellcapitalized capital category federal law also requires that the bank regulatory agencies implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories with progressively more restrictions on operations management and capital distributions 

the prompt corrective action requirements apply only to fdicinsured depository institutions and not to bhcs however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the bhc based on the undercapitalized status of any such subsidiary institution and in certain instances the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary institution nevertheless if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to bhcs we believe that keycorp would satisfy the criteria for the wellcapitalized capital category at december 31 2012 an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or parent bhc and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent bhc 

basel accords 

basel i 

the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies and applicable to key and described above are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” 

basel iii capital and liquidity framework 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” basel iii is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the 

  

regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector these measures aim to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress whatever the source improve risk management and governance and strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures basel iii requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress and the introduction of two global liquidity standards 

the basel iii final capital framework among other things introduces as a new capital measure “common equity tier 1” and specifies that tier 1 capital consists of common equity tier 1 and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements 

the implementation of the basel iii final capital framework commenced january 1 2013 and will be fully phasedin on january 1 2019 beginning january 2013 banks with regulators adopting these standards in full are required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 35 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 45 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 80 total capital to riskweighted assets the implementation of a capital conservation buffer effectively raising the minimum capital requirements will begin on january 1 2016 at 0625 and be phasedin over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

when fully phasedin the basel iii capital framework will require banks to maintain a a minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets of at least 45 plus a 25 capital conservation buffer b a tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 6 plus the capital conservation buffer c a minimum ratio of total that is tier 1 plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 80 plus the capital conservation buffer and d a minimum leverage ratio of 3 calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain offbalance sheet exposures as the average for each quarter of the monthend ratios for the quarter thus when the capital conservation buffer is fully phasedin minimum ratios will effectively be 7 for common equity tier 1 85 for tier 1 capital and 105 for total capital with the 3 leverage ratio being maintained basel iii also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a common equity tier 1 addon to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0 to 25 when fully implemented potentially resulting in total buffers of between 25 and 5 

the basel iii final capital framework provides for a number of adjustments to including new deductions from tier 1 capital these include for example the inclusion of the mark to market on the available for sale investment securities portfolio the deduction of the defined pension benefit asset the deduction of certain deferred tax assets and the requirement that mortgage servicing rights and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from common equity tier 1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of common equity tier 1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of common equity tier 1 implementation of the adjustments and new deductions from common equity tier 1 will begin on january 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year 

the final basel iii liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of liquidity risk exposure 

 

  

 both of these measures are subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements the basel iii liquidity framework provides specifically that revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio will be made by mid2013 with such ratio being introduced as a requirement on january 1 2015 revisions to the net stable funding ratio will be made by mid2016 and the net stable funding ratio will be introduced as a requirement on january 1 2018 

  

in january 2013 the basel committee issued its revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio important changes include a phasedin implementation introduction as planned on january 1 2015 but with minimum requirements beginning at 60 rising in equal annual steps of 10 to reach full implementation on january 1 2019 an expansion of the range of assets eligible to be highquality liquid assets and some refinements to the assumed inflow and outflow rates to better reflect actual experience in times of stress 

given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when corresponding us capital regulations are finalized while we have a strong liquidity position the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives including adding additional liquid assets issuing term debt and modifying our product pricing for loans commitments and deposits us regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the basel iii liquidity framework accordingly at this point it is premature to assess its impact 

proposed implementation of the basel iii capital framework 

on august 30 2012 the federal banking agencies jointly published three separate nprs seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise and replace their current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the doddfrank act as well as the implementation of the basel iii capital framework the comment period on these nprs ended on october 22 2012 

one npr the “basel iii npr” proposes the majority of the revisions to international capital standards in basel iii including a more restrictive definition of regulatory capital such as providing for the phaseout of trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital higher minimum regulatory capital requirements and the imposition of capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers it also proposes limitations on certain distributions and discretionary bonuses as well as revisions to the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations another npr the “standardized approach npr” proposes new methodologies for determining riskweighted assets such as by expanding the number and type of exposure categories providing a more comprehensive recognition of collateral and guarantees and introducing or applying more risksensitive treatment for certain exposures including certain highvolatility commercial real estate corporate equity foreign securitization derivative residential mortgage and 90 day or more past due exposures it also proposes detailed qualitative and quantitative public disclosure requirements relating to capital adequacy the final npr the “advanced approaches npr” proposes to revise the current advanced approaches riskbased capital rule to incorporate certain aspects of basel iii as well as certain other revisions to the basel capital framework published by the basel committee between 20092011 while key and keybank are subject to the basel iii and standardized approach nprs they are not subject to the advanced approaches npr 

implementation of the basel iii final capital framework was proposed to begin on january 1 2013 with minimum capital ratios and prompt corrective action requirements implemented by january 1 2015 and the capital conservation buffer phasedin from january 1 2016 through january 1 2019 on november 9 2012 however the agencies issued a joint press release the “november 2012 release” indicating that none of the basel iii standardized approach and advanced approaches nprs would become effective on january 1 2013 and that the agencies would take operational and other considerations into account when determining appropriate implementation dates and associated transition periods for them 

new proposed minimum capital requirements 

as originally proposed beginning january 1 2013 banking organizations subject to the basel iii and standardized approach nprs like key would be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december 31 2012 key had a tier 1 common equity ratio of 1136 under current basel i also at december 31 2012 based on the fully phasedin basel iii and standardized approach nprs key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios after adjustment for market risk pursuant to the new joint final market risk rule would be as set forth in the following table there can be no guarantee however that the basel iii and standardized approach nprs will be adopted in their current form what changes may be made before adoption or when ultimate adoption will occur 

  

estimated ratios vs proposed minimum capital ratios calculated under the fully phasedin basel iii and standardized approach nprs 

 

  

  

  

 revised prompt corrective action standards 

under the basel iii npr the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank are proposed to be revised the table below identifies the proposed capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under current law and the basel iii and standardized approach nprs 

proposed revised prompt corrective action well capitalized and adequately capitalized capital category ratios 

 

 we believe that as of december 31 2012 key and keybank would meet all capital adequacy and corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements under the basel iii and standardized approach nprs on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective there can be no guarantee that the basel iii and standardized approach nprs will be adopted in their current form what changes may be made before adoption or when ultimate adoption will occur 

as previously indicated the prompt corrective action requirements apply only to fdicinsured depository institutions and not to bhcs nevertheless if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to bhcs we believe that keycorp would meet all prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements for a wellcapitalized capital category at december 31 2012 under the basel iii and standardized approach nprs on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective 

  

capital planning and review of capital actions 

us bhcs with total consolidated assets of at least 50 billion including keycorp must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and notwithstanding written nonobjection to the capital plan must obtain in certain circumstances written approval or nonobjection to make capital distributions such bhcs are also subject to federal reserve supervisory guidance with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends capital redemptions and capital repurchases in the context of such bhc’s capital planning processes including the supervisory expectation for prior notification to and consultation with federal reserve supervisory staff regarding certain dividends and capital redemptions and repurchases 

the federal reserve’s supervisory review of a bhc’s capital plan includes an assessment of 

 

  

  

 nineteen of the largest bhcs including keycorp are required to submit a capital plan to the federal reserve for ccar ccar is an annual exercise by the federal reserve to ensure that the largest bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of financial and economic stress and robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates such bhc’s capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and plans to take capital actions including capital distributions keycorp filed its ccar 2013 capital plan on january 7 2013 on january 28 2013 the federal reserve announced that the results from ccar 2013 will be released on march 14 2013 

as part of ccar the federal reserve will continue to evaluate whether proposed capital actions are appropriate in light of the bhc’s plans to meet the proposed basel iii requirements as part of its capital plan submission the bhc should provide a transition plan that includes pro forma estimates under baseline conditions of the bhc’s regulatory capital ratios under the proposed basel iii capital framework as it would be implemented in the us bhcs that meet the minimum ratio requirement during the basel iii transition period but remain below the 7 tier 1 common equity target minimum plus capital conservation buffer will be expected to maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting the capital conservation buffer under the timeframe described in the basel iii npr subject to extension pursuant to the november 2012 release 

the federal reserve will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions for companies whose capital plans are approved by regulators and who are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to continue to operate as financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios even after making the planned capital distributions 

dividend restrictions 

federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in 

  

excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits in addition if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a banking organization such as keycorp and keybank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the organization could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such organization cease and desist from such practice 

during 2012 keybank paid keycorp a total of 18 billion in dividends nonbank subsidiaries did not pay any cash or noncash dividends to keycorp as of january 1 2013 keybank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to keycorp during 2012 keycorp did not make any capital infusions to keybank at december 31 2012 keycorp held 22 billion in shortterm investments which can be used to pay dividends to shareholders service debt and finance corporate operations 

federal deposit insurance act 

deposit insurance and assessments 

the fdic’s dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits which insurance is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank pursuant to the doddfrank act the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased permanently from 100000 to 250000 per depository and the coverage of noninterest bearing transaction accounts was unlimited through december 31 2012 

the fdic assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums the doddfrank act required the fdic to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity keybank’s current annualized deposit insurance premium assessments range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its assessment base depending on its scorecard performance factors incorporating keybank’s regulatory rating ability to withstand asset and funding related stress and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure 

on october 31 2012 the fdic amended its large bank assessment final rule applicable to keybank the amendment revises the definitions of certain risk assets specifically higherrisk commercial and industrial loans and securities and higherrisk consumer loans clarifies when an asset must be identified as higherrisk and clarifies the way securitizations are identified as higherrisk these definitions affect the higherrisk concentration measure higherrisk assets to tier 1 capital and reserves found in the large and highly complex institution scorecards the amendment generally becomes effective on april 1 2013 we estimate that our 2013 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be in the range of 37 to 41 million 

conservatorship and receivership of institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed the conservator or receiver under the fdia in such an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which such institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by the other party to the contract against the receivership or conservatorship the amount paid upon such claim would depend upon among other factors the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and the priority of the claim relative to the priority of others in addition the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision regarding termination default acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution the fdic as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors these provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of key’s bank subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as keybank including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors in the public markets 

  

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent bhc such as keycorp and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

the bank secrecy act 

the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things establish a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligenceknowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in our common shares or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry described below are certain risks and uncertainties the occurrence of which could have a material and adverse effect on us before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations andor access to liquidity andor credit could be materially and adversely affected “material adverse effect on us” if this were to happen the value of our securities — common shares series a preferred stock trust preferred securities and debt securities — could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

our erm program identifies key’s major risk categories including market compliance credit liquidity and operational together with reputation and strategic risks the following risk factors are grouped into categories consistent with the five preceding main categories of risk focused on in our erm program with an additional category for risks related to investment in our common shares 

i market risks 

the global financial markets continue to be strained as a result of economic slowdowns and concerns especially about the creditworthiness of the european union and its member states and financial institutions in the european union these factors could have international implications which could hinder the us economic recovery and affect the stability of global financial markets 

certain european union member states have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue which has caused investor concern over such countries’ ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth in their economies during 2012 the european debt crisis caused spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets and liquidity to be less abundant while the situation has started to stabilize the european debt crisis and measures adopted to address it have significantly weakened european economies a weaker european economy may cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of european financial institutions and the stability of european member economies 

  

a failure to adequately address sovereign debt concerns in europe could hamper economic recovery or contribute to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the financial markets including in the united states potential events which could have such an impact on the financial markets include i sovereign debt default default by one or more european governments in their borrowings ii european bank andor corporate debt default iii market and other liquidity disruptions and iv if stresses become especially severe and the collapse of the european union as a coherent economic group andor the collapse of its currency the euro although a financial institution in the united states may have little to no exposure to european sovereign debt or eurodenominated assets the european and american financial markets are substantially linked especially through the federal reserve which at times has offered stimulus funding to european governments and through larger us financial institutions which invest in european assets and institutions due to the interconnectedness of european and american financial markets a liquidity freezeup in europe could detrimentally impact key by causing among other things an increase in our cost of borrowed funds an inability to borrow funds through conventional markets negative impacts upon our counterparties and customers especially those with european business relationships or european assets and negative impacts upon the us economy should the global financial markets and the us economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors the likelihood for loan and asset growth at us financial institutions like key may deteriorate any combination of these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

the us economy remains vulnerable as the economic recovery continues to progress slowly 

the us economy showed signs of moderate growth during the second half of 2012 despite slow growth during the first half of the year according to the fomc despite signs of growth the recovery of the us economy continues to progress slowly certain downside risks to the us economy remain present strains in the global financial markets pose significant risk to the us economy high unemployment and underemployment the slow pace of job creation and slowing growth in business fixed investment are additional factors of concern fiscal austerity in the form of higher taxes and spending cuts would further hamper growth over the nearterm and policy uncertainty another constraint on growth may linger for some time the us economy could also be affected by the slowdown in economic activity abroad especially in europe and the significant fiscal challenges that remain for local governments in the us 

the continuation or worsening of these factors could weaken the us economic recovery underway the downgrade of us treasury securities by sp and political difficulties in addressing the economy within the us government have contributed to high levels of volatility in the financial markets should economic indicators deteriorate the us could face another recession which could affect us in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways as well as affect our borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations we have taken steps since the 20082009 financial crisis to strengthen our liquidity position nevertheless a return of the volatile economic conditions recently experienced including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets for an extended period of time particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our earnings on loans and other interestearning assets 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on 

  

loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “risk management — interest rate risk management” found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on us 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located — the rocky mountains and northwest the great lakes and the northeast — as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets outside of our footprint the delinquencies nonperforming loans and chargeoffs that we have experienced since 2007 have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions certain markets such as florida southern california phoenix arizona and las vegas nevada experienced more significant deterioration during the recession while values have stabilized over the past year they remain well below peak levels across markets the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources and in turn may have a material adverse effect on us 

ii compliance risks 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the doddfrank act and other financial reform initiatives banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes may subject us to additional compliance costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and the manner in which we operate our businesses increase our litigation and regulatory costs should we fail to appropriately comply with such laws regulations or policies and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report for further information 

additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institutionaffiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices if we were the subject of an enforcement action it could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

the regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states including the doddfrank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

the united states and other governments have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry we have faced increased regulation of our industry and will continue to face such regulation into 2013 as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus financial market stability and enhancement of the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions we have also faced increased regulation as a result of new efforts designed to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse 

we also expect more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels particularly due to both keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions for the enhanced prudential standards promulgated under the doddfrank act although many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect other parts are still in the implementation stage which is likely to continue for several years accordingly some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the doddfrank act as fully implemented compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase our costs and reduce our revenue and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities and to take certain types of corporate actions for more detailed information on the regulatory environment and the laws rules and regulations that may affect us see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

iii credit risks 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector are improving but remain relatively weak under continuing pressure by reduced asset values high vacancies and reduced rents commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of 2007 according to moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property index commercial real estate values were down approximately 22 from their peak as of november 2012 a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans these properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases which may also lead to existing lease turnover 

the us economy remains highly vulnerable and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the nascent recovery in commercial real estate the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents has continued to lag behind the overall economy or not occur at all these economic factors typically affect certain industries such as real estate and financial services more significantly to illustrate this point improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by 12 to 18 months our clients include entities active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time or fundamentals deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income it could have a material adverse effect on us 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the recession from december 2007 to june 2009 the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels the severe market dislocations in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining of the credit 

  

markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable for example a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks incurred in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to credit risk in the form of changes in interest rates changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate andor changes in the financial condition of our counterparties which changes could adversely affect us 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor further weakening of economic conditions caused by another recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 70 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 

we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmentalrelated covenants which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants our credit quality could be adversely affected the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is 

  

liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us additionally in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on us 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions however are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us any such losses could have a material adverse effect on us 

iv capital and liquidity risks 

capital requirements imposed by the doddfrank act together with new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the basel committee will result in banks and bhcs needing to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case 

new and evolving capital standards both as a result of the doddfrank act and the implementation of new capital standards adopted by the basel committee including “basel iii” will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of basel iii and possible revisions to current capital rules see the sections titled “supervision and regulation” and “capital” 

the full effect of the federal reserve’s possible revisions to the basel iii liquidity standards on key is uncertain at this time the need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand either organically or through acquisitions it could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid shortterm investments thereby reducing our ability to invest in longerterm assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective 

in addition the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution” such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has set forth the processes that bank holding companies should have in place to ensure they hold adequate capital under adverse conditions to maintain ready access to funding before engaging in any of these activities these rules could limit key’s ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares see “supervision and regulation —” in item 1 of this report 

there can be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government will continue to support increased stability in the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has intervened in an unprecedented manner in an effort to provide stability and liquidity to the financial markets the federal reserve is currently maintaining a variety of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy these policy measures have been maintained by the fomc over the last few years as economic growth unemployment and inflation have not been at levels mandated for the fomc to achieve 

  

market liquidity issues have been alleviated somewhat but us growth still lags levels mandated for the fomc to achieve and the us economy remains vulnerable in addition while the situation in europe has stabilized somewhat the region’s recession and ongoing fiscal challenges remain important risks to the us economy there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that these government initiatives will have on the financial markets the failure of the us government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the us economy on a stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening of current financial market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on us in the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets return or become exacerbated there may be a material adverse effect on us from i continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets ii continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically iii limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system or iv further recessionary conditions 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation” in item 1 of this report 

in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on us 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of which are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry the financial markets and the economy there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings 

on october 18 2012 sp maintained its “positive” outlook rating for each of keycorp and keybank sp’s ratings for keycorp’s shortterm borrowings and senior longterm debt are a2 and bbb respectively and keybank’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt are rated a2 a and bbb respectively 

in light of the various changes in the ratings methodologies underway as a result of the doddfrank act there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings if the securities of keycorp andor keybank suffer ratings downgrades such downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us thereby reducing our ability to generate income downgrades of the credit ratings of securities particularly if they are below investmentgrade could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 

  

although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2009 credit markets have improved since then and we have significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth exiting certain noncore lending businesses diversifying our funding base maintaining a liquid asset portfolio and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity many of these disrupted markets have shown signs of recovery throughout 2012 nonetheless if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time should our funding needs necessitate it we may need to expand our use of other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available under certain stressed conditions experienced in the liquidity crisis during 20072009 some of these alternative means of funding were not available should these forms of funding become unavailable it could have a material adverse effect on us 

v operational risks 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing revenue and reducing expenses through targeted investments technology enhancements and streamlining our operations as part of our efficiency initiative we have committed to achieving an annual expense run rate reduction of 150 to 200 million by december 2013 and a cash efficiency ratio in the target range of 60 to 65 by the first quarter of 2014 there may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing our efficiency initiative and there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the full benefits of or be able to sustain the annual cost savings anticipated by our efficiency initiative our inability to achieve the anticipated outcomes of our stated strategies may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability our strategic priorities also include developing maintaining and building longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our failure to execute our strategic initiatives relating to any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to operational risk 

we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats to cybersecurity and computertelecommunications malfunctions operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate 

  

resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or a failure to establish appropriate controls or to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us 

our methods of reducing risk exposure might not be effective 

instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications 

while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a possible failure interruption or breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that such action will not occur or if any does occur that it will be adequately addressed for example although we maintain commercially reasonable measures to ensure the cybersecurity of our information systems other financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems in addition several us financial institutions including key have recently experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means to date none of these efforts has had a material effect on our business or operations such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients although we have adjusted our cybersecurity program to anticipate that a breach is more likely and have placed a greater focus on detection and incident response our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm 

  

we are also increasingly reliant on third party service providers to perform significant operational services on our behalf these third party providers are subject to the same risks relating to cybersecurity breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees while we make every effort to mitigate these risks through specific contractual obligations relating to security and strong oversight of these service providers there can be no assurance that one or more of our third party service providers will not experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur that it will be adequately addressed 

any failure interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those of our third party service providers could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our offerings of mobile payments and other internet or webbased products notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity a disruptive event impacting the infrastructure that supports our business such as a failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could adversely affect our reputation result in a loss of customer business result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal actions against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 

we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act the creation of the cfpb and the uncertainty as to whether federal preemption of certain state consumer laws remains intact for federally chartered financial institutions like keybank and keycorp a weakening of federal preemption would potentially increase our compliance and operational costs and risks since we are a national bank with multistate operations and customers and we would potentially face state and local enforcement activity 

there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any damage to our reputation from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on us 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we 

  

have established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us 

vi strategic and reputation risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in recent years competition has intensified due to substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry a trend that may continue the competitive landscape was also affected by the liquidity crisis which led to the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives developing maintaining and building longterm customer relationships based on quality service competitive prices high ethical standards and safe sound assets and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry and our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on us 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want andor need to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the doddfrank act and other legislation and regulations in addition our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the federal reserve which may identify deficiencies in the structure causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us 

maintaining or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices for our products and services 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and smart phones requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks while new services allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have 

  

historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 

the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expenditures we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest margin and feebased products and services all factors which may have a material adverse effect on us 

our failure to effectively “crosssell” our products and services to customers could have a negative effect on our revenue growth and financial results 

selling more products or services to our customers or “crossselling” is an integral part of our business model and is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings during the current period of slow economic growth and regulatory reform many of our competitors also focus on crossselling especially in retail banking and mortgage lending this can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices reducing our net interest income and revenue from our feebased products it could also affect our ability to retain our existing customers as our competitors increase their crossselling efforts and new technologies require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers we may face difficulties in increasing our crossselling ratio or the average number of products sold to existing customers our failure to sell additional products or services to our existing or new customers who instead purchase such products from our competitors could have a material adverse effect on us 

damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 

our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry declined since the recent downturn in the us economy we continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry can also significantly adversely affect our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses 

our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues gives rise to reputational risk that could cause significant harm to us and our business prospects and may have a material adverse effect on us 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including 

 

    

        we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 

vii risks to our common shares 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

our common shares are not a bank deposit and therefore are not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of december 31 2012 keycorp and its subsidiaries and its employees directors and officers are defendants or putative defendants in a variety of legal proceedings in the form of regulatorygovernment investigations as well as private civil litigation and arbitration proceedings the private civil litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings by both government agencies and selfregulatory bodies these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication arbitration or investigation and involve a variety of claims including common law tort contract claims securities erisa and consumer protection claims at times these legal proceedings present novel claims or legal theories 

on at least a quarterly basis we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements these legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable we have not accrued legal reserves consistent with applicable accounting guidance based on information currently available to us advice of counsel and available insurance coverage we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition we note however that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves as a result the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operation for a particular period depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period

 economic overview 

the economy continued to tread water in 2012 with overall gdp and payroll growth remaining modest and inline with 2010 and 2011 levels the quarterly flow of data also followed a similar pattern as that of the prior two years with a relatively solid start midyear slump and modest recovery by yearend in both 2010 and 2011 slowing growth in the middle of the year was largely due to a series of external shocks — the sovereign debt crisis and bp oil spill in 2010 and the arab spring and japanese tsunami in 2011 the recovery was further challenged in 2011 by the debt ceiling debate and subsequent credit rating downgrade in 2012 the story was less about shocks and more about constant and at times strengthening headwinds once again the economy had a strong start but paused heading into the summer as the debt crisis and renewed recession in europe along with slowing growth in the emerging markets grabbed headlines and sapped export demand in addition to these global concerns rising political and policy uncertainty in the us led to a sharp pullback in business investment central banks around the world including the fed and the european central bank came to the rescue with a range of policy tools which stabilized financial markets and set the stage for a moderate uptick in growth in the second half of the year the sp 500 equity index managed to avoid a major market correction and ended the year up 13 compared to relatively no change during 2011 

for the year 217 million new jobs were added up from the 2011 total of 210 million jobs added the unemployment rate fell further from 85 to 78 while job growth was a factor improvement in this measure was also driven by a steady decline in the participation rate which stood at a 25year low at yearend with substantial labor market slack remaining wage growth deteriorated through much of the year and income growth was weak consumer spending meanwhile held up reasonably well resulting in a falling savings rate a slowing rate of inflation supported incomes and therefore spending through the first half of the year but shifted to a drag at midyear due to a sharp rise in energy prices by yearend inflation fell again as energy prices retreated with headline cpi of just 17 in december of 2012 compared to 30 one year earlier core inflation also moderated through the year ending 2012 at 14 down from 19 in 2011 

the housing market shifted from a drag to a boost in 2012 with solid improvement in nearly all metrics with the economy continuing its modest expansion and home prices appearing to stabilize demand for forsale housing posted steady gains sales of existing homes rose to an annualized pace of 494 million in december 2012 down slightly from the previous month but up 13 from 2011 new home sales also improved reaching a pace of 369000 as with existing homes sales were down monthovermonth but up 9 over 2011 levels as the share of distressed transactions fell prices stabilized in the first half of the year and registered consistent gains in the second half with the median price for existing homes up 11 yearoveryear in december 2012 housing starts accelerated further up 28 over the prior year’s pace driven by substantial gains in both multifamily and single family construction 

the federal reserve remained active and accommodative in 2012 keeping the federal funds target rate near zero expanding their balance sheet further and making significant changes to their communications after remaining on hold in the first half of the year the fed announced additional policy actions in june as growth deteriorated at that time operation twist the federal reserve’s process of buying and selling short and longterm bonds was extended through yearend in september the fed announced a third round of quantitative easing with 40 billion in mortgagebacked securities purchased each month importantly the fed left the program openended both in quantity and time also in september the fed extended their federal funds interest rate guidance to mid2015 in november the fed capped a busy year with additional asset purchases and the adoption of numerical thresholds based on these thresholds the federal funds rate will be kept near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 65 percent and the inflation forecast remains below 25 percent the 

  

movement in rates through the year partially reflected fed actions but also clearly tracked the economy and perception of risk looking at the 10year us treasury the yield moved from 19 at the beginning of the year approached 22 in march as the economy appeared to take off and fed commentary turned more hawkish and then fell below 15 in july as the economy stumbled and the european debt crisis reignited as europe stabilized and economic data improved the 10year yield moved higher ending the year at 18 even as fed accommodation grew 

longterm financial goals 

our longterm financial goals are as follows

corporate strategy 

we remain committed to enhancing longterm shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship business model growing our franchise and being disciplined in our management of capital to that end our 20122013 strategic focus is to build enduring relationships through clientfocused solutions and extraordinary service our strategic priorities for enhancing longterm shareholder value are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 strategic developments 

we initiated the following actions during 2012 and 2011 to support our corporate strategy 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 highlights of our 2012 performance 

financial performance 

for 2012 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 827 million or 88 per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 857 million or 92 per common share for 2011 

figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years 

  

figure 3 results of operations 

 

  

  

  

 in 2012 our fullyear result reflects success in executing our strategies to grow loans add payment capabilities to our product line in the form of credits cards and improved mobile banking and moving forward on our efficiency initiative 

our efficiency initiative ended 2012 with annual run rate savings of approximately 60 million we continue to invest in the future revenue growth of our company by upgrading our technology to meet the needs of our clients we remain committed to delivering on our goal of achieving a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65 as we enter 2014 

the net interest margin from continuing operations was 321 for 2012 this was an increase of five basis points from 2011 this increase was primarily attributable to lower funding costs and increased loan fees we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher cost certificates of deposit and growing lower cost transaction accounts our current expectation assuming the policy of low interest rates by the federal reserve continues is for the net interest margin to be in the 330 range for the first quarter of 2013 and for continued downward pressure in the one to three basis point range per quarter thereafter during 2013 

average total loans increased 18 billion or 36 during 2012 compared to 2011 the average balances of commercial financial and agricultural loans increased from 175 billion to 211 billion or approximately 208 which led our yearoveryear average loan growth we have continued to have success in growing our commercial loan portfolio by acquiring new clients in our focus industries as well as expanding existing relationships for 2013 we anticipate average total loans to grow in the mid to upper single digit range continuing to be led by growth in our commercial and industrial loans 

  

we originated new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses of approximately 378 billion during 2012 compared to approximately 366 billion in 2011 

our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 86 at december 31 2012 compared to 87 at december 31 2011 

our trend of improving the mix of deposits continued during 2012 as we experienced a 71 billion or 14 increase in nontime deposits approximately 50 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december 31 2012 with a 120 average cost are scheduled to mature over the next twelve months the maturation of these certificates of deposit and other liability repricing opportunities will continue help to offset repricing pressure on our assets this improved funding mix reduced the cost of interestbearing deposits during 2012 compared to 2011 

our asset quality statistics continued to improve during 2012 net chargeoffs declined to 345 million or 69 of average loan balances for 2012 compared to 541 million or 111 for 2011 in addition our nonperforming loans declined to 674 million or 128 of period end loans at december 31 2012 compared to 727 million or 147 at december 31 2011 our allowance for loan losses stood at 888 million or 168 of period end loans compared to 1 billion or 203 at december 31 2011 and represented 132 and 138 coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “credit risk management” our expectation for net charge offs and provision expense during 2013 is to remain within our longterm targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points 

our tangible common equity ratio and tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at december 31 2012 at 1015 and 1136 respectively as compared to 988 and 1126 at december 31 2011 these ratios have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group for these measures we have identified four primary uses of capital the first is investing in our businesses supporting our clients and our loan growth second is maintaining or increasing our common stock dividend third is to return capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders fourth is to be disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time our capital management remains focused on value creation to that end in 2012 we returned approximately 50 of our net income to shareholders through both common share repurchases and dividends we also used our capital to acquire market share in western new york and to develop new revenue streams in the credit card and payment systems businesses 

the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of our 2013 capital plan under the ccar process until such time as they have completed their review and have no objection to our plan we are not permitted to take any further actions to implement our plan for quarters subsequent to the first quarter of 2013 for the 2013 ccar process the federal reserve has advised that it will provide us and each bhc subject to ccar with the initial results of the federal reserve’s poststress capital analysis on march 7 2013 we will then have the opportunity to make a onetime downward adjustment to our 2013 capital plan if necessary before the federal reserve renders its final public objection or noobjection decision in the event the federal reserve would in whole or in part object to our plan in its final public decision we may submit a request for reconsideration of our plan within 10 days which the federal reserve is required to respond to within 10 days in such circumstances absent receipt of a noobjection following a request for reconsideration we would be required to resubmit our plan within 30 days upon receipt of a resubmitted capital plan the federal reserve has 75 days to notify the bhc of its objection or noobjection should we receive an objection it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year 

we continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network in 2012 our focus related to our branch network shifted more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint into more attractive markets during 2012 we closed 19 underperforming branches as part of our plan another 40 to 50 branch closures are planned for 2013 with the majority of these closures planned for the second quarter of 2013 

  

figure 4 presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” “return on tangible common equity” and “tier 1 common equity” tier 1 common equity a nongaap financial measure is a component of tier 1 riskbased capital tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations however since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations since early 2009 the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 common equity because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories the basel committee’s final basel iii framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation which us regulators propose to implement in the near future also makes tier 1 common equity a priority finally the enactment of the doddfrank act also changed the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital at the end of a threeyear phaseout period that commenced on january 1 2013 our trust preferred securities will be treated only as tier 2 capital the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 business of this report contains more information about these regulatory initiatives 

the table also shows the computation for preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our ability to absorb loan losses by presenting our results on a more comparable basis period to period 

the cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation management believes this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks additionally this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although investors frequently use nongaap financial measures to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap these nongaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies

 results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

  

  

  

 to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

  

figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past six years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2012 was 23 billion and the net interest margin was 321 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 23 billion and a net interest margin of 316 for the prior year total 2012 net interest income remained flat compared to the prior year as a reduction in interest income on earning assets was offset by interest expense savings on deposits and borrowings the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to a lower level and change in mix of average earning assets resulting from pay downs on higher yielding loans and investments the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to continued improvement in the mix of deposits through the maturity of higher costing certificates of deposit and the growth of low cost nontime and noninterest bearing deposit balances we also have benefitted from a reduction of longterm debt 

average earning assets for 2012 totaled 718 billion which was 11 billion or 2 lower than the 2011 level the reduction reflects a 30 billion reduction in our investments portfolio as securities were only partially reinvested to accommodate loan growth of 18 billion and debt maturities and redemptions

 noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2012 was 20 billion up 159 million or 9 from 2011 in 2011 noninterest income decreased by 146 million or 7 compared to 2010 

gains on leased equipment increased 86 million from 2011 primarily due to early terminations in the leveraged lease portfolio net gains losses from loan sales doubled from 2011 due to an increase in volume in our commercial mortgage banking business other income increased 64 million primarily due to gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities investment banking and capital markets income also increased 31 million from one year ago due to a 26 million improvement reduction of losses related to previouslyheld visa shares these increases were partially offset by a 47 million decline in operating lease income due to product runoff and a 42 million decrease in electronic banking fees as a result of government pricing controls on debit card transactions that went into effect on october 1 2011 

noninterest income for 2011 decreased 92 million from 2010 when excluding the gain realized from the sale of tuition management systems and the 54 million in income generated by that business unit during 2010 operating lease income decreased 51 million due to product runoff deposit service charges decreased 20 million during 2011 reflecting the fullyear impact of the implementation in the third quarter of 2010 of regulation e under the electronic fund transfer act of 1978 favorable results from letter of credit and loan fees and net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests were more than offset by declines in trust and investment services income corporateowned life insurance income net securities gains insurance income and investment banking and capital market income 

  

figure 7 noninterest income 

 

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income the primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in figure 8 the 2012 and 2011 decreases of 13 million or 3 and 10 million or 2 respectively were primarily attributable to lower institutional asset management and custody fees which more than offset increases in personal asset management and custody fees 

figure 8 trust and investment services income 

 

 a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2012 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 497 billion compared to 517 billion at december 31 2011 as shown in figure 9 decreases in the securities lending and money market portfolios were partially offset by increases in the equity and fixed income portfolios our securities lending business has been declining due to our deemphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes client departures and fewer assets under management the previously announced plan to liquidate the victory money market mutual funds was completed in 2012 the assets in these funds were either transferred back to key in the form of nontime deposits alternative investments or other money market mutual funds or back to the clients the decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds was attributable to our 2009 decision to wind down the operations of austin results included in discontinued operations the decline in the equity portfolio in 2011 from 2010 was due in part to asset outflows and market value declines 

  

figure 9 assets under management 

 

  

  

 service charges on deposit accounts 

the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in 2012 was primarily due to core deposit account growth the decrease in 2011 was primarily due to implementation of regulation e pursuant to the electronic fund transfer act of 1978 which went into effect on july 1 2010 for new clients and august 15 2010 for our existing clients partially offset by deposit account growth 

operating lease income 

operating lease income recorded in our equipment finance line of business decreased 47 million during 2012 and decreased 51 million in 2011 compared to the prior years due to product runoff accordingly as shown in figure 11 operating lease expense also declined 

investment banking and capital markets income loss 

as shown in figure 10 income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased 31 million in 2012 after having decreased 11 million in 2011 

investment banking income increased 19 million in 2012 as investment advisory fees increased 12 million and debt and equity underwriting fees increased 4 million other investment income decreased 8 million from 2011 resulting from lower gains on sale of certain investments made by our real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business in key corporate bank dealer trading and derivative income loss increased 26 million from 2011 primarily due to improved fixed income sales foreign exchange income decreased 6 million in 2012 due to lower transaction volume 

investment banking income decreased 20 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreased levels of equity financings and advisor fees other investment income increased 15 million from 2010 resulting from gains on sale of certain investments made by our real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business dealer trading and derivative income loss decreased 6 million from 2010 as a decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives was more than offset by an increase related to credit default swap valuation adjustments also impacting this line item was a 24 million charge resulting from visa’s late fourth quarter 2011 announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit 

  

figure 10 investment banking and capital markets income loss 

 

  

  

 corporateowned life insurance income 

corporateowned life insurance income remained essentially unchanged in 2012 from one year ago the 16 million or 12 decrease in corporateowned life insurance income from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the impact of a nonrecurring 12 million bonus dividend received in 2010 

net gains losses from loan sales 

net gains losses from loan sales are derived from two primary sources commercial mortgage banking activities and residential mortgage loan originations net gains from loan sales doubled in 2012 primarily due to an increase in volume in our commercial mortgage banking business results in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 the types of loans sold during 2012 and 2011 are presented in figure 20 

net gains losses from principal investing 

principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privatelyheld companies our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to mediumsized businesses these investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 627 million at december 31 2012 and 709 million at december 31 2011 during 2011 employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that serve as investment managers of these investments under this arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties these individuals are no longer employees of key as a result of these changes we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments totaling 234 million the net gains losses presented in figure 7 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments 

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 11 noninterest expense for 2012 was 29 billion up 117 million or 4 from 2011 in 2011 noninterest expense declined by 244 million or 8 from 2010 

  

in 2012 personnel expense increased by 98 million driven by higher levels of expense in each category shown in figure 12 nonpersonnel expense increased 19 million primarily due to increases in several expense categories — 19 million in intangible asset amortization 12 million in the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments 23 million in other expense 8 million in marketing and 7 million in business services and professional fees these increases in nonpersonnel expense were partially offset by a 37 million decrease in operating lease expense due to product runoff and a 21 million decrease in the fdic assessment 

of the overall 117 million increase in noninterest expense in 2012 61 million is attributable to the acquisition of the credit card portfolios and 37 branches in western new york and 25 million is cost attributable to key’s efficiency initiative 

in 2011 personnel expense increased by 49 million driven by higher levels of incentive compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 293 million primarily due to a 72 million decrease in the fdic assessment a 55 million decrease in net oreo expense a 48 million decrease in operating lease expense due to product runoff and favorable reductions across several expense categories as a result of our expense management efforts these favorable results were partially offset by the provision for unfunded commitments which was a credit of 28 million in 2011 compared to a credit of 48 million in 2010 

figure 11 noninterest expense 

 

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 12 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 98 million or 6 in 2012 following a 49 million or 3 increase in 2011 salaries increased 70 million due to several factors — higher levels of contract labor for technology investments attributable to the credit card portfolio acquisitions and related implementation of new payment systems and merchant services processing increased hiring of clientfacing personnel including our acquisition of 37 branches in western new york and base salary increases employee benefits increased 13 million primarily due to pension expense and higher medical claims incentive compensation increased 7 million as a result of higher commission expenses driven by increased activity in debt and equity placements stockbased compensation also increased 6 million while severance expense increased 2 million 

  

of the overall 98 million increase in personnel expense in 2012 8 million is attributable to the acquisition of the credit card portfolios and 37 branches in western new york and 18 million is attributable to key’s efficiency initiative technology contract programming expense increased 47 million 

the 2011 increase in personnel expense was largely due to a 40 million increase in incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability employee benefits expense increased 5 million due to increased medical claim expenses salaries expense increased 6 million due to higher levels of contract labor as the reduction in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees offset the impact of base salary increases severance expense also increased by 5 million while stockbased compensation decreased by 7 million 

figure 12 personnel expense 

 

  

 intangible asset amortization 

in 2012 the acquisition of the credit card portfolio as well as 37 branches in western new york resulted in an increase in intangible amortization of 19 million 

operating lease expense 

the decrease in operating lease expense in both 2012 and 2011 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as “operating lease income” 

fdic assessment 

fdic assessment expense decreased in 2012 and 2011 as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “deposit insurance and assessments” section in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 business of this report 

oreo expense 

in 2012 oreo expense increased modestly by 2 million in 2011 improved liquidity for incomeproducing properties that began in 2010 and carried through into 2011 resulted in an 8 million increase in net gains on sale of oreo while valuation writedowns decreased 43 million from 2010 

provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 

the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments fluctuated during the years shown as a result of variability in underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments 

  

other expense 

in 2012 the 23 million increase in other expense included 3 million in onetime expenses and 14 million in recurring expenses associated with the acquisition of the credit card portfolios and 37 branches in western new york in 2011 the 98 million decrease in other expense was due to favorable reductions across several expense categories as a result of our expense management efforts 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 239 million for 2012 compared to a tax provision of 369 million for 2011 and 186 million for 2010 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 218 for 2012 compared to 274 for 2011 and 234 for 2010 

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves in addition in 2012 our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the irs 

at december 31 2012 we have recorded a valuation allowance of 3 million against the gross deferred tax assets for certain state net operating loss and state credit carryforwards 

during 2010 we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of 32 million to reflect management’s change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in nonus subsidiaries

 key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 106 million for 2012 compared to 212 million for 2011 and 155 million for 2010 the decline in 2012 was due to an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in total revenue 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 52 million or 35 from 2011 average loans and leases grew 15 billion or 58 while average deposits increased by 1 billion or 22 compared to 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 58 million to net interest income 436 million to average loans and leases and 903 million to deposits the positive contribution to net interest income from the acquisitions was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits in 2012 compared to one year ago 

noninterest income increased by 27 million or 36 from 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 24 million mainly in credit card fees trust and investment services income and service charges on deposit accounts trust and investment services income increased 14 million due to an increase in assets under management resulting from market appreciation and increased production as well as the acquisitions other income increased 48 million primarily due to gains realized on the sale of certain tax credits and an increase in credit card fees net gains losses from loan sales were also 12 million higher in 2012 these increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a 42 million decline in electronic banking fees resulting from government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect october 1 2011 

the provision for loan and lease losses declined by 4 million or 25 from 2011 excluding the acquisition of the credit card portfolio and the chapter 7 bankruptcy loans the provision for loans and leases would have decreased by 86 million compared to 2011 net loan chargeoffs declined 82 million or 287 from 2011 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio 

noninterest expense increased by 150 million or 82 from 2011 the western new york branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed 61 million to the increase in noninterest expense spread across several expense categories including personnel loan servicing and intangible asset amortization various other 

  

expenses including internallyallocated support costs occupancy costs and overhead costs also increased from 2011 

in 2011 the 57 million increase in net income attributable to key compared to 2010 was due to decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses of 253 million partially offset by declines in taxableequivalent net interest income and noninterest income

 key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 15 key corporate bank recorded net income from continuing operations attributable to key of 453 million for 2012 compared to 568 million for 2011 and 427 million for 2010 the 2012 decline was driven by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by an increase in taxableequivalent net interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense 

  

taxableequivalent net interest income increased by 29 million or 41 in 2012 compared to 2011 average earning assets increased 14 billion or 75 from 2011 while the spread rate remained flat year over year resulting in a 33 million increase in the earning asset spread deposit balances grew 18 billion or 170 from 2011 but this growth in balance was offset by a reduction in the value of deposits due to historically low interest rates 

noninterest income increased by 2 million or 2 from 2011 driven by increases of 67 million in net gains losses from loan sales from commercial mortgage banking activities in the real estate capital line of business 10 million in letter of credit and loan fees and 6 million in investment banking and capital markets income these increases were offset by decreases of 32 million in operating lease revenue 24 million in trust and investment services income related to a reduction in assets under management and a 25 million decline in other income due to gains realized in 2011 related to the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business 

the provision for loan and lease losses was a charge of 24 million in 2012 compared to a credit of 198 million in 2011 the 2012 charge was driven by growth in the loan and lease portfolio but still reflects lower levels of net loan chargeoffs and a continued release of loss reserves due to improved credit quality net loan chargesoffs decreased 74 million from 2011 to 64 million in 2012 

noninterest expense declined by 16 million or 18 from 2011 primarily due to a 24 million decline in operating lease expense on product runoff this reduction was partially offset by a 9 million increase in net oreo expense resulting from a lower level of gains in 2012 than recorded in 2011 

the 2011 improvement in net income from continuing operations attributable to key compared to 2010 resulted from a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 91 million or 113 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreased deposit balances and a reduction in the value of deposits due to historically low interest rates noninterest income increased 28 million or 33 driven by increases in letter of credit and loan fees and gains on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business the provision for loan and lease losses decreased 170 million as a result of improved credit quality noninterest expense decreased 119 million or 119 driven by net oreo gains recorded in 2011 versus net oreo expense in 2010 along with decreases in operating lease expense on product runoff and decreases in other various expense categories

 other segments 

other segments consists of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios other segments generated net income attributable to key of 245 million for 2012 compared to 175 million for 2011 the 2012 results reflect increases in taxableequivalent net interest income and noninterest income of 32 million and 110 million respectively included in noninterest income was an increase in gains on leased equipment of 85 million primarily due to the termination of certain leveraged leases in 2012 and a 54 million gain on the redemption of certain trust preferred securities noninterest expense also declined 25 million these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of 67 million 

in 2011 other segments generated net income attributable to key of 175 million compared to a net loss of 1 million for 2010 the 2011 results reflected a 22 million decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income and a decline in the provision for loan and lease losses of 278 million offset by various other items

 at december 31 2012 total loans outstanding from continuing operations were 528 billion compared to 496 billion at the end of 2011 and 501 billion at the end of 2010 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 52 billion at december 31 2012 58 billion at december 31 2011 and 65 billion at december 31 2010 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section titled “consumer loan portfolio” within this discussion the increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past year results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial financial and agricultural portfolio along with the credit card portfolio and branch acquisition for more information on balance sheet carrying value see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the headings “loans” and “loans held for sale” 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 369 billion at december 31 2012 an increase of 21 billion or 60 compared to december 31 2011 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 16 our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represent 440 and 399 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and are the largest component of our total loans the loans consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans increased 35 billion or 176 from one year ago this growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio is primarily attributable to our clients in the manufacturing technology and healthcare industries we are experiencing growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and in our institutional and capital markets business additionally we are increasing loans to real estate investment trust “reit” clients and institutionallybacked commercial real estate “cre” funds reits and institutional cre funds effectively enable us to lend to entities that generally have more diverse cash flows lower debt levels and better access to the capital markets than private owners or developers 

commercial real estate loans our cre lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 14state banking franchise and keybank real estate capital a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of cre located both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 543 of our average yeartodate commercial real estate loans compared to 555 one year ago keybank real estate capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate 

cre loans represent 165 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2012 compared to 188 one year ago these loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties which at december 31 2012 represented 237 of our commercial loan portfolio compared to 269 one year ago these loans have decreased 626 million or 67 to 87 billion at december 31 2012 from 93 billion at december 31 2011 this decrease in our cre portfolio has resulted from many of our clients taking advantage of historically low longterm interest rates to refinance their loans in the permanent loan market we have also been derisking the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized cre 

figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank as shown in figure 17 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral 

  

as shown in figure 17 at december 31 2012 our cre portfolio included mortgage loans of 77 billion and construction loans of 10 billion representing 146 and 19 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represented 106 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represented 59 of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2012 was 35 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2012 had a balance of 73 million at december 31 2012 our average construction loan commitment was 39 million our largest construction loan commitment was 568 million and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was 567 million 

also shown in figure 17 at december 31 2012 640 of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 651 at december 31 2011 approximately 149 and 185 of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments a significant decline in economic growth and in turn in rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans 

figure 17 commercial real estate loans 

 

  

 during 2012 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 47 million from 174 million at december 31 2011 to 127 million at december 31 2012 as a result of continued improvement in asset quality and market conditions this compares to a decrease of 234 million during 2011 

since december 31 2011 our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately 501 million or 82 as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 

if the economic recovery stalls it may weaken the commercial real estate market fundamentals ie vacancy rates the stability of rental income and asset values leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments accordingly the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 

  

commercial lease financing we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our key equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 133 of commercial loans at december 31 2012 and 163 at december 31 2011 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions forgiveness of principal and other modifications loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performanced under the restructured loan terms over the past year 

if the loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements we transfer the loans to the asset recovery group for resolution during 2012 there were 284 million of new restructured loans of which 109 million related to commercial loans and 175 million to consumer loans 

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 5 “asset quality” 

figure 18 quantifies restructured loans and tdrs as of december 31 2012 72 million of secured loans discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower were reclassified as consumer tdrs regardless of delinquency status these loans were accounted for at the fair market value of the collateral less selling costs are classified as nonaccrual and are included in nonperforming loans 

figure 18 commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status 

 

   

we use an ab note structure for our tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches first we create an a note as the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in longterm markets and take out underwriting standards of our various lines of business appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes typically also allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification moreover the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically commercial real estate the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction and local markets are spared distressedfire sales 

the b note typically is an interestonly note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the a note we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current well documented evaluation of the credit which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition prospects for repayment under the modified terms and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral we wait a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

all loans processed as tdrs including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 

extensions project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but sometimes they are modified and extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for both the client and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees and a cash flow sweep some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in in those cases pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 

loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any therefore pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 

we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

  

guarantors we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary the high level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and near term debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly we may require certain information such as liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

as of december 31 2012 we had 39 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loantovalue ratio greater than 10 and were accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding increased by 11 billion or 78 from one year ago the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 959 of this portfolio at december 31 2012 is derived from our key community bank the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans in key community bank increased by 587 million or 64 over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values improved employment and favorable borrowing conditions 

as shown in figure 14 we hold the first lien position for approximately 55 of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31 2012 and 53 at december 31 2011 for consumer loans with real estate collateral we track borrower performance monthly regardless of the lien position credit metrics are refreshed quarterly including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loantovalue ratio this information is used in establishing the alll our methodology is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” 

regulatory guidance issued in january 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans at december 31 2012 45 of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages during the second quarter of 2012 approximately 49 billion of second lien home equity loans were reviewed by a third party service to determine the payment status of the associated first lien the resulting data identified approximately 48 million of second lien home equity loans with an associated first lien that is either 120 days or more past due or in foreclosure or for which the first mortgage delinquency timeframe is unknown in accordance with the above mentioned regulatory guidance these loans were classified as nonperforming in the second quarter of 2012 the classification of these identified second liens as nonperforming loans did not have an impact on the alll during the second quarter of 2012 or subsequent 

  

quarters because as noted above we have previously considered the risk characteristics of this portfolio of loans in our loss estimation methodology on at least a quarterly basis we will continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively and therefore prior periods were not adjusted 

in conjunction with the updated regulatory guidance that was issued in the third quarter of 2012 at december 31 2012 home equity loans include 72 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed

 loans held for sale 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale were 599 million at december 31 2012 compared to 728 million at december 31 2011 there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

at december 31 2012 loans held for sale included 477 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by 90 million from december 31 2011 and 85 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by 10 million from december 31 2011 valuations are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets including credit spreads treasury rates interest rate curves and risk profiles as well as our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios we review our assumptions quarterly for additional information related to the valuation of loans held for sale see note 6 “fair value measurements” 

during 2012 we recorded net gains losses from loan sales of 150 million on the income statement of which 59 million related to sales of loans classified as held for sale this 59 million was comprised of net unrealized losses of 4 million and net realized gains of 63 million we have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry having exited this business in 2006 

  

loan sales 

as shown in figure 20 during 2012 we sold 35 billion of commercial real estate loans 18 billion of residential real estate loans and 144 million of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio sales of mortgage loans held by our real estate investment entity leases and other loans not classified as held for sale generated net gains of 91 million in 2012 additionally there were no education loans sold included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet 

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are

 figure 21 shows loans that are either administered or serviced by us but not recorded on the balance sheet the table includes loans that have been sold 

figure 21 loans administered or serviced 

 

   

  

 in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 1 billion of the 108 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2012 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

figure 22 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2012 approximately 294 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year

 securities 

our securities portfolio totaled 16 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 181 billion at december 31 2011 availableforsale securities were 121 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 16 billion at december 31 2011 reflecting the liquidity needs arising from changes in our loan and deposit balances and investments in heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities were 39 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 21 billion at december 31 2011 primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgagebacked securities as we continue to prepare for potential future changes in regulatory capital rules essentially all of our heldtomaturity securities portfolio was invested in cmos at december 31 2012 

as shown in figure 23 all of our mortgagebacked securities which include both securities available for sale and heldtomaturity securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the availableforsale portfolio and at cost for the heldtomaturity portfolio for more information about these securities see note 6 “fair value measurements” under the heading “qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques” and note 7 “securities” 

  

figure 23 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 

 

  

 securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of cmos which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities cmos generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements at december 31 2012 we had 12 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 159 billion at december 31 2011 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

throughout 2012 our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times throughout the year served to provide the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities as well as the branch acquisition including credit card assets obtained in september 2012 in july 2012 and the acquisition of keybranded credit card assets in august 2012

 heldtomaturity securities 

federal agency cmos constitute essentially all of our heldtomaturity securities the remaining balance comprises foreign bonds and capital securities our heldtomaturity securities increased during the second half of 2011 and throughout 2012 due to purchases of federal agency cmos as we increased this portfolio in response to potential future changes in regulatory capital rules figure 25 shows the composition yields and remaining maturities of these securities

other investments 

principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 589 of other investments at december 31 2012 they include direct investments investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value 627 million at december 31 2012 and 709 million at december 31 2011 during the first half of 2011 employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that now serve as investment managers of these investments under this arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties these individuals are no longer employees of key as a result of these changes which were made during the second quarter of 2011 we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments totaling 234 million 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain real estaterelated investments that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information this review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry thirdparty data and other relevant factors during 2012 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 72 million which includes 15 million of net unrealized gains these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

deposits and other sources of funds 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding during 2012 average domestic deposits were 611 billion and represented 850 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 585 billion and 801 during 2011 the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled “net interest income” 

the increase in average domestic deposits in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to the growth from demand deposits as increases in interestbearing liquid deposits were largely offset by declines in certificates of deposit 100000 or more and other time deposits the western new york branch acquisition added approximately 2 billion of mostly nontime consumer deposits to the fourth quarter 2012 average balances 

approximately 50 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december 31 2012 mature over the next year at a 120 average cost repricing opportunities will continue to benefit our net interest margin improved funding mix and previous maturities of our certificates of deposit have reduced the cost of total deposits which is down from 2011 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 30 billion during 2012 compared to 34 billion during 2011 the change from 2011 resulted from a 40 million decrease in foreign office deposits a 206 million decrease in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings and a 167 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

at december 31 2012 key had 33 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

 capital 

at december 31 2012 our shareholders’ equity was 103 billion up 366 million from december 31 2011 the following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity 

ccar and capital actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires a bhc to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions as previously reported as authorized by our board and pursuant to our 2012 capital plan submitted to the federal reserve as part of ccar and not objected to by the federal reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2012 keycorp had authority to repurchase up to 344 million of our common shares for general repurchase and repurchases in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs 

we have remaining authority to repurchase up to 88 million of our common shares for general repurchase and repurchases in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date common share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2013 

as previously reported our 2012 capital plan also included an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from 03 to 05 per share which went into effect during the second quarter of 2012 future dividends will be evaluated by the board of directors based upon our earnings financial condition and other factors including regulatory review further information regarding the capital plan process and ccar is included in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report in item 1 business under the heading “capital assessment and review of capital actions” 

provisions of the doddfrank act and the basel iii npr provide for the phaseout of tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013 as a result our outstanding trust preferred securities will eventually become tier 2 capital the supervision and regulation section of this report contains more detailed information about the basel iii npr 

on july 12 2012 keycorp redeemed all of the enhanced trust preferred securities of keycorp capital x in the amount of 568 million and all of the trust preferred securities of keycorp capital vii in the amount of 139 million 

repurchase of tarp cpp preferred stock warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings 

as previously reported during 2011 we completed the repurchase of the 25 billion of series b preferred stock and corresponding warrant issued to the us treasury department as a result of the repurchase we recorded a 49 million onetime deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the 

  

repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase on april 20 2011 we repurchased the warrant directly from the us treasury for 70 million beginning with the second quarter of 2011 the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of 31 million and discount amortization of 4 million or 140 million on an annual basis related to these preferred shares in total we paid 2867 billion to the us treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends principal and repurchase of the warrant resulting in a return to the us treasury of 367 million above the initial investment of 25 billion on november 14 2008 

dividends 

during the first quarter of 2012 we made a dividend payment of 03 per share or 29 million on our common shares during each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 we made a dividend payment of 05 per share or 47 million on our common shares 

also in 2012 we made four quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share or 6 million on our series a preferred stock 

for additional information about quarterly dividends for 2012 and 2011 see figure 44 of this report 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 32084 holders of record at december 31 2012 our book value per common share was 1078 based on 9258 million shares outstanding at december 31 2012 compared to 1009 based on 9530 million shares outstanding at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 our tangible book value per common share was 967 compared to 911 at december 31 2011

 at december 31 2012 we had 912 million treasury shares compared to 640 million treasury shares at december 31 2011 during 2012 shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

in the past we have periodically repurchased common shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors the program does not have an expiration date and we have outstanding board authority to repurchase 88 million in common shares we did not repurchase any common shares during all of 2011 or 2010 other than the shares acquired from employees in connection with our stock compensation plan as discussed in further detail in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 business of this report we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management may propose to make during the year pursuant to that requirement we have submitted our capital plan for review to the federal reserve that contemplates among other uses of our capital additional share repurchases in 2013 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2012 our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to adjust to the regulations currently being proposed by the federal banking agencies to implement basel iii and provisions of 

  

the doddfrank act our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1151 at december 31 2012 compared to 1116 at december 31 2011 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 1015 at december 31 2012 compared to 988 at december 31 2011 

banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bhcs and their banking subsidiaries riskbased capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “riskweighted assets” riskweighted assets consist of total assets plus certain offbalance sheet and market risk items subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors currently banks and bhcs must maintain at a minimum tier 1 capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 400 and total capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 800 as of december 31 2012 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio and our total riskbased capital ratios were 1215 and 1513 respectively compared to 1299 and 1651 respectively at december 31 2011 

another indicator of capital adequacy the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskadjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 300 all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 400 as of december 31 2012 our leverage ratio was 1141 compared to 1179 at december 31 2011 

the enactment of the doddfrank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 capital the three year phaseout period which commenced january 1 2013 will ultimately result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier 2 capital these changes in effect apply the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs savings and loan holding companies and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 business of this report contains more detailed information regarding capital 

as of december 31 2012 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were 1215 1141 and 1513 respectively the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute 339 million or 43 40 and 43 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio respectively as of december 31 2012 the proposed new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of key at december 31 2012 calculated on a fully phasedin basis under the basel iii and standardized approach nprs are set forth in the new minimum capital requirements table in the supervision and regulation section in part 1 of this report 

federal bank regulators group fdicinsured depository institutions into five categories ranging from “wellcapitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” a “wellcapitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 600 for tier 1 riskbased capital 500 for tier 1 leverage capital and 1000 for total riskbased capital and must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure if these provisions applied to bhcs we believe we would qualify as “wellcapitalized” at december 31 2012 and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category analysis on an estimated basis accounting for the phaseout of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible and therefore as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2012 also determines that we would qualify as “wellcapitalized” under current regulatory guidelines basel i with the estimated tier 1 riskbased capital ratio estimated leverage ratio and estimated total riskbased capital ratio being 1173 1101 and 1513 respectively the revised prompt corrective action standards table in the “supervision and regulation” section in part 1 business of this report discloses the proposed new threshold capital ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution the regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in item 1 business in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report under the heading “capital” 

  

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations as a result of the financial crisis the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies including keycorp the capital modifications mandated by the doddfrank act and set forth in basel iii which the federal banking agencies have recently proposed to implement are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks bhcs and covered nonbank financial companies which resulted from the financial crisis tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4 in the “highlights of our performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to tier 1 common equity the corresponding nongaap measure our tier 1 common equity ratio was 1136 at december 31 2012 compared to 1126 at december 31 2011 

generally for riskbased capital purposes deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarterend date based on its projected future taxable income for the year or ii 10 of the amount of an institution’s tier 1 capital as we anticipated at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier 1 capital and riskweighted assets at december 31 2012 for key’s consolidated operations we had a federal net deferred tax asset of 83 million and a state deferred tax liability of 13 million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of 60 million and a state deferred tax liability of 24 million at december 31 2011 we have recorded a valuation allowance of 3 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards 

basel iii 

a detailed discussion of current rulemaking underway in the us to implement basel iii is in the “supervision and regulation” section in item 1 business of this report the “new minimum capital requirements” table in the “supervision and regulation” section discloses the proposed new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of key at december 31 2012 calculated on a fully phasedin basis under the basel iii and standardized approach nprs given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when us capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized while we also have a strong liquidity position the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives including adding additional liquid assets issuing term debt and modifying our product pricing for loans commitments and deposits

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 11 “variable interest entities” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2012 is presented in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

  

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 16 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 30 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2012 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 30 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

  

 guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as 

  

underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 16 under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit liquidity market compliance operational strategic and reputation risks our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

the keycorp board of directors serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective balanced and adds value for the shareholders the keycorp board of directors understands key’s risk philosophy approves the risk appetite inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks both actual and emerging and determines whether management is responding appropriately the board challenges management and ensures accountability 

the keycorp audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity regulatory and legal compliance independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and all risk review functions including internal audit the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance the audit committee has responsibility over financial reporting compliance risk and legal matters the implementation management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information security and fraud risk and associated reputation and strategic risks 

the keycorp risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies policies procedures and practices relating to the management of credit risk market risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk including the actions taken to mitigate these risks as well as reputational and strategic risks the risk committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital reviews the enterprise risk management erm reports and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 

the audit and risk committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

our erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the risk committee of our board of directors annually the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments membership of the risk governance committees includes representatives from each of the three lines of defense the first line of 

  

defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept own proactively identify monitor and manage risk the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating analyzing and reporting risk information risk review provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness appropriateness and adherence to keycorp’s risk management policies practices and controls 

the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions ensures appropriate ownership of risks provides input into performance and compensation decisions assesses aggregate enterprise risk monitors capabilities to manage critical risks and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 

federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and comport with regulatory expectations 

market risk management 

the cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads volatilities or equity prices these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline when market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 

interest rate risk management 

most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within board approved policy limits 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

 

  

  

   

 net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments including a most likely macro economic scenario simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 

typically the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months and term rates were to move in a similar fashion in light of the low interest rate environment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including a sustained flat yield curve an inverted slope yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance shifts investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2012 and 2011 at december 31 2012 our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive alco policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 as shown in figure 31 we are operating within these limits 

  

figure 31 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 the fomc has indicated it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2015 we continued to execute investment and hedging activities to migrate toward a more modest assetsensitive position hedging activities reflect the changes in the growth mix and maturity of customer deposits our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 

the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure 31 net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelvemonth horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve twentyfour and thirtysix month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

  

figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

figure 32 portfolio swaps by interest rate risk management strategy 

 

  

  

 management of other market risks 

key also incurs market risk as a result of trading investing and client facilitation activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets lines of business key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these products we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 

we use a statistical technique known as var as one of the tools to measure monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolios our market risk management group calculates and distributes daily varbased measurements to management in various lines of business using two years of historical information the model estimates the maximum potential oneday loss with a 95 confidence level statistically this means that losses will exceed var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter we perform backtesting procedures to evaluate the accuracy of our var model and continue to enhance the modeling techniques and inputs and assumptions used to ensure proper measurement and monitoring of market risks 

we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by our market risk committee as part of our erm program at december 31 2012 the aggregate oneday trading limit set by the committee was 62 million for all trading portfolios we are operating within these constraints during 2012 our aggregate period end daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 7 million 11 million 5 million and 2 million respectively during 2011 our aggregate period end daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 13 million 15 million 1 million and 21 million respectively 

in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis we monitor loss limits use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests and scenario analysis we report our market risk exposure and results of monitoring activities to the risk committee of the board of directors and to the market risk committee 

  

liquidity risk management 

we define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the risk committee of the keycorp board of directors the keybank board of directors the erm committee and the alco these groups regularly review various liquidity reports including liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive we communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

on march 8 2012 fitch a credit rating agency downgraded keycorp’s series a preferred stock to bb and keycorp’s trust preferred securities to bb these rating downgrades were a result of a change in fitch’s rating criteria that similarly affected securities ratings for many financial institutions 

our credit ratings at december 31 2012 are shown in figure 33 we believe that these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 

figure 33 credit ratings 

 

   

managing liquidity risk 

we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2012 totaled 86 billion consisting of 43 billion of unpledged securities 14 billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and 29 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2012 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 146 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 47 billion at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loan to deposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2012 our loan to deposit ratio was 86 which we calculate as total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs described in note 15 “longterm debt” that enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

  

in august 2012 keybank adopted a 20 billion global bank note program this program is similar to prior keybank note programs and allows keybank to issue notes domestically and abroad with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes these notes may be denominated in us dollars or in foreign currencies each note will be the sole obligation of keybank on january 29 2013 key issued 1 billion of senior bank notes due february 1 2018 under the global bank note program these notes have a coupon of 165 per annum and are not redeemable prior to maturity 

in 2012 key’s outstanding note balance decreased by 30 billion maturities of 19 billion in medium term notes and 300 million in subordinated notes occurred for keybank while keycorp had maturities of 438 million in medium term notes and payoffs totaling 707 million related to redeemed trust preferred securities 

liquidity for keycorp 

the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

we use three primary measures to assess parent company liquidity net cash position a cash coverage metric and the liquidity gap the net cash position measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets the cash coverage metric measures the ability to meet all projected obligations the “liquidity gap” represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons we generally issue term debt to manage our liquidity position within targeted ranges the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next 24 months at december 31 2012 keycorp held 22 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies 

typically the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration in 2012 keybank paid the parent 18 billion in dividends while nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent the parent did not make any capital infusions to keybank in 2012 as of january 1 2013 keybank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to keycorp 

during the first quarter of 2011 keycorp completed a 625 million equity offering at a price of 885 per common share at the same time keycorp issued 1 billion 51 senior mediumterm notes series i the proceeds from the sale of common shares and mediumterm notes were used along with other available funds to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of 31 million and discount amortization noncash of 4 million or 140 million on an annual basis related to these preferred shares 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has decreased as a result of debt maturities trust preferred securities redemptions and net customer loan and deposit flows however the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer term solution on january 29 2013 key issued 1 billion of senior bank notes due february 1 2018 under the global bank note program this issuance provided additional liquidity to support normal business flows and maintain our liquid asset portfolio within target levels 

  

from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means we periodically repurchase common shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors additional information on keycorp’s common share repurchase program is included in part ii item 2 unregistered sales of equity securities or use of proceeds of this report such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions regulatory requirements and other factors the amounts involved may be material individually or collectively 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities we have approximately 183 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2012 as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 29 million in taxes to be paid if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase by approximately 40 million accordingly we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2012 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

  

we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 2 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2012 we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was 76 million at december 31 2012 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk we utilize credit default swaps to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2012 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 547 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity at december 31 2012 the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of reducing our net credit default swap position was 40 million 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the trading income component of noninterest income 

we may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2012 the alll was 888 million or 168 of loans compared to 1 billion or 203 at december 31 2011 the allowance includes 35 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 411 million at december 31 2012 compared to 51 million that was allocated for impaired loans of 388 million one year ago for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2012 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 13175 of nonperforming loans compared to 13810 at december 31 2011 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 34 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 34 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

  

   

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in credit policies or underwriting standards and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 

for all commercial and consumer tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate we estimate the extent of impairment by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its expected cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full on at least a quarterly basis we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses the alll at december 31 2012 represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

as shown in figure 35 our alll decreased by 116 million or 12 during the past twelve months this contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio which has trended more favorably over the past twelve months asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving we attribute this improvement to improving economic activity more favorable conditions in the housing market and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments decreased by 16 million to 29 million at december 31 2012 compared to the same period one year ago when combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses our total allowance for credit losses represented 174 of loans at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 212 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 we expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during 2013 as a result of the continued improvement in credit quality that is anticipated

 our provision credit for loan and lease losses was a provision of 229 million for 2012 compared to a credit of 60 million for 2011 our net loan chargeoffs were 345 million for 2012 compared to 541 million for 2011 our net loan chargeoffs for 2012 included 33 million of chargeoffs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans and leases discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be chargedoff to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency additionally we continue to work down our exit loans and leases and reduce exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net chargeoffs 

  

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2012 totaled 345 million or 69 of average loans including 33 million of incremental net loan chargeoffs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged through chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency status in addition we incurred 13 million of net charge offs related to our two acquisitions completed in 2012 these results compare to net loan chargeoffs of 541 million or 111 for 2011 figure 36 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 37 

over the past twelve months net loan chargeoffs decreased 196 million as shown in figure 39 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 78 million or 23 of total net loan chargeoffs for 2012 net chargeoffs in the exit loan portfolio decreased by 37 million from 2011 due to decreases in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios

as shown in figure 38 nonperforming assets decreased during 2012 having declined for the past three years most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans nonperforming loans held for sale and oreo in the commercial real estate line of business as shown in figure 39 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 83 million or 11 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2012 compared to 119 million or 14 at december 31 2011 

at december 31 2012 the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 57 of their original contractual amount owed total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 73 of their contractual amount owed and total nonperforming assets represented 70 of their original contractual amount owed at the same date oreo represented 39 of its original contractual amount owed while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 60 of their contractual amount owed 

at december 31 2012 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 179 million representing 27 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations compared to 237 million representing 33 in the prior year 

figure 39 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2012 and 2011 the net chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of these loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 5 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2012 compared to 8 at december 31 2011 additional information about loan sales is included in the “loans and loans held for sale” section under “loan sales”

 operational risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 

the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee a senior management committee oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committee’s oversight of these controls 

fourth quarter results 

our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in figure 44 highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2012 are summarized below 

  

earnings 

our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was 193 million or 21 per common share compared to 201 million or 21 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 we incurred 16 million or 01 per common share of costs associated with our previously announced efficiency initiative fourth quarter 2012 net income attributable to key common shareholders was 197 million compared to 194 million for the same quarter one year ago 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 97 compared to 101 for the fourth quarter of 2011 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 770 for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 826 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 607 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the net interest margin was 337 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 563 million and a net interest margin of 313 for the fourth quarter of 2011 the increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was primarily a result of a change in funding mix from the redemption of certain trust preferred securities maturity of longterm debt and maturity of highercosting certificates of deposit during the past year 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 466 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 414 million for the yearago quarter net gains losses from loan sales increased 30 million from the yearago quarter due to an increase in volume in our commercial mortgage banking business investment banking and capital markets income also increased 23 million from one year ago the fourth quarter of 2011 included a 24 million charge resulting from visa’s announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit 

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 756 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 717 million for the same period last year personnel expense increased 46 million due to several factors – an increase in contract labor for technology investments attributable to the previously announced credit card portfolio acquisitions and related implementation of new payment systems and merchant services processing higher employee benefits due to an increase in medical claims expense and an adjustment to the annual retirement contribution accrual and severance expense associated with our efficiency initiative nonpersonnel expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 decreased 7 million from one year ago operating lease expense oreo and marketing expense decreased from the year ago quarter these declines were partially offset by an increase of 11 million related to the amortization of the intangible assets associated with the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the previously announced credit card portfolio as well as the branches in western new york 

provision for loan and lease losses 

our provision for loan and lease losses was 57 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to a credit of 22 million for the yearago quarter our allowance for loan and lease losses was 888 million or 168 of total periodend loans at december 31 2012 compared to 203 at december 31 2011 

net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2012 totaled 58 million or 44 of average loans compared to 105 million or 86 for the same period last year 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 55 million compared to a tax provision of 69 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 217 compared with 252 for the same quarter one year prior for the fourth quarter of 2012 the tax rate was lower due to lower pretax income and slightly higher tax credits earned during the period

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial and consumer troubled debt restructurings regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly 

  

from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2012 would indicate the need for a 16 million increase in the allowance the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 37 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 10 million or 01 per share a 37 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 23 million or 02 per share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2012 143 billion or 161 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2012 11 billion or 15 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

at december 31 2012 56 million or 1 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis approximately 36 of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 at december 31 2012 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

  

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 627 million at december 31 2012 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2012 earnings by approximately 63 million 39 million after tax or 04 per share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” new accounting guidance that was effective january 1 2012 for us permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2012 therefore the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill because the strength of the economic recovery remained uncertain during 2012 we continued to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly the acquisition of 37 retail banking branches in western new york resulted in a 62 million increase in the goodwill at the key community bank unit at december 31 2012 the key community bank reporting unit had 979 million in goodwill while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill additional information is provided in note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 19 “employee benefits” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2012 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

derivatives and hedging 

we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after 

  

taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 16 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2012 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe that it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

during 2012 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures the financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation continued during 2011 and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial institutions including through the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” least cost resolution process albeit at a slower pace than 2010 financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 157 banks that failed during 2010 representing 967 billion in total assets were redistributed through the fdic’s leastcost resolution process 

supervision and regulation 

the following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies financial holding companies and banks and provides certain specific information regarding material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the fdic and the banking system as a whole rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors as described in detail in item 1a risk factors comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing due to the passage of the doddfrank act we cannot predict changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies yet such changes may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

general 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” under the bhca pursuant to the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

under the doddfrank act and longstanding federal reserve policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when we may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of a bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bank holding companies but bank holding company affiliates are principally regulated by 

  

functional regulators such as the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” for national banks the sec for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of functional regulation although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks 

our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december 31 2011 we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary on january 17 2012 we opened another national bank subsidiary its activities are limited to those of a fiduciary the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over keybank and keycorp under the federal deposit insurance act as amended the “fdia” because domestic deposits in keybank are insured up to applicable limits and certain debt obligations of keybank and keycorp are guaranteed until maturity by the fdic 

we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations our brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

capital 

dividend restrictions 

federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries historically dividends paid to us by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits during 2008 2009 and 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011 keybank did not pay any dividends to us and nonbank subsidiaries paid 25 million in dividends during 2010 and 45 million in dividends during 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2011 keybank paid 300 million in dividends to us at january 1 2012 keybank has capacity to pay 13 billion in dividends to keycorp under the applicable supervisory guidance tests at december 31 2011 we held 21 billion in shortterm investments which can be used to pay dividends service debt and finance operations 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a banking organization including keycorp and keybank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice 

capital assessment and review of capital actions 

the federal reserve has issued supervisory guidance and published a capital plans final rule requiring bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in assets such as keycorp to consult with the federal reserve staff before taking actions such as increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments such guidance and final rule provide for a comprehensive 

  

capital analysis and review “ccar” including a supervisory capital assessment review and outlines the federal reserve’s expectations concerning the processes that such bank holding companies should have in place to ensure they hold adequate capital under adverse conditions to maintain ready access to funding the procedures require the implementation of a comprehensive capital plan and demonstration that the bank holding company will meet the basel iii regulatory capital standards including the basel iii fullyphased in 7 tier 1 common equity target after giving effect to proposed dividend increases or other capital actions keycorp is currently undergoing a capital assessment review pursuant to the supervisory program 

regulatory capital standards 

federal banking regulators have promulgated riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

under the riskbased capital requirements keycorp and its bank subsidiaries are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which include certain offbalance sheet assets such as standby letters of credit of 8 at least half of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders’ equity excluding the over or underfunded status of postretirement benefit obligations unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges net of deferred income taxes plus certain mandatorily redeemable equity investments this is called “tier 1 capital” the remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt certain hybrid capital instruments qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses this is called “tier 2 capital” each of the federal banking regulatory agencies including the federal reserve the occ and the fdic also have established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets the minimum leverage ratio is currently 3 for bank holding companies that are considered “strong” under the federal reserve board’s guidelines or which have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4 bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels depending upon their particular condition risk profile or growth plans at december 31 2011 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum leverage capital requirements and satisfied the ccar requirements set forth in supervisory guidance 

as part of the doddfrank act federal banking agencies are required to develop capital requirements that address systemically risky activities the effect of these capital rules will disallow trust preferred securities from counting as tier 1 capital at the holding company level for entities with greater than 15 billion in assets with a three year phasein period beginning on january 1 2013 

bank holding companies with securities and commodities trading activities that exceed specified levels are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk 

prompt corrective action 

the fdia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically 

  

undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered wellcapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure at december 31 2011 keybank was wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action standards federal law also requires that the bank regulatory agencies implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories with progressively more restrictions on operations management and capital distributions 

the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as keycorp however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the bank holding company based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary in certain instances the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary if such categories applied to bank holding companies we believe that keycorp would satisfy the wellcapitalized criteria at december 31 2011 an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or parent bank holding company and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank holding company 

basel accords 

overview 

the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” in 2004 the basel committee published a new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying their activities 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline in december 2007 us federal banking regulators issued a final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other institutions to elect to optin currently neither keycorp nor keybank is required to apply this final rule 

basel iii capital framework 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” basel iii is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector these measures aim to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress whatever the source improve risk management and governance and strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures basel iii requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress and the introduction of two global liquidity standards 

the basel iii final capital framework among other things introduces as a new capital measure “tier 1 common equity” and specifies that tier 1 capital consists of tier 1 common equity and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements 

  

the implementation of the basel iii final capital framework will commence january 1 2013 and be fully phasedin on january 1 2019 beginning january 2013 banks with regulators adopting these standards in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios – 35 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 45 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 80 total capital to riskweighted assets the implementation of a capital conservation buffer effectively raising the minimum capital requirements will begin on january 1 2016 at 0625 and be phasedin over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 the basel iii capital framework will require banks to maintain a a minimum ratio of tier 1 common equity to riskweighted assets of at least 45 plus a 25 “capital conservation buffer” b a tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 6 plus the capital conservation buffer c a minimum ratio of total that is tier 1 plus tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets of at least 80 plus the capital conservation buffer effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 105 upon full implementation and d a minimum leverage ratio of 3 calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain offbalance sheet exposures as the average for each quarter of the monthend ratios for the quarter thus when the capital conservation buffer is fully phasedin minimum ratios will effectively be 7 for tier 1 common equity 85 for tier 1 capital and 105 for total capital with the 3 leverage ratio being maintained at december 31 2011 we had a tier 1 common equity ratio of 1126 under current basel i basel iii also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a common equity tier 1 addon to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0 to 25 when fully implemented potentially resulting in total buffers of between 25 and 5 

the basel iii final framework provides for a number of adjustments to including new deductions from tier 1 capital these include for example the inclusion of the mark to market on the available for sale investment securities portfolio the deduction of the defined pension benefit asset the deduction of certain deferred tax assets and the requirement that mortgage servicing rights and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from tier 1 common equity to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of tier 1 common equity or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of tier 1 common equity implementation of the adjustments and new deductions from tier 1 common equity will begin on january 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year 

on january 13 2011 the basel committee issued its final “minimum requirements to ensure loss absorbency at the point of nonviability” document it requires that all noncommon tier 1 and tier 2 instruments eg noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and subordinated debt issued by an internationally active bank must have a provision that such instruments at the option of the relevant regulator are to either be writtenoff or converted into common equity upon the occurrence of certain trigger events the final loss absorbency requirements specify that instruments issued on or after january 1 2013 must meet the new criteria to be included in regulatory capital instruments issued prior to january 1 2013 that do not meet the criteria but that meet all of the entry criteria for additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital will be considered as instruments that no longer qualify as additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital and will be phased out from january 1 2013 in accordance with the basel iii framework these provisions are similar to the concept set forth in the doddfrank act of phasing out trust preferred securities cumulative preferred securities and certain other securities as tier 1 capital over a threeyear period beginning january 1 2013 as well as the application of similar capital standards to bhcs as are currently applied to depository institutions in connection with a rulemaking published in the federal register in january 2012 the federal reserve indicated that it is in the process of developing a rulemaking with other agencies to implement basel iii accordingly a notice of proposed rulemaking is expected during the first half of 2012 given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when corresponding us capital regulations are finalized 

  

basel iii liquidity framework 

the final basel iii liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of liquidity risk exposure 

 

  

 each of the components of these ratios is defined and the ratio calculated in accordance with detailed requirements in the basel iii liquidity framework although the basel committee has not asked for additional comment on these ratios both are subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements the basel iii liquidity framework provides specifically that revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio will be made by mid2013 with such ratio being introduced as a requirement on january 1 2015 revisions to the net stable funding ratio will be made by mid2016 and the net stable funding ratio will be introduced as a requirement on january 1 2018 

the federal reserve is expected to publish in the firsthalf of 2012 a notice of proposed rulemaking for the implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework while we have a strong liquidity position the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives including adding additional liquid assets issuing term debt and modifying our product pricing for loans commitments and deposits us regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the basel iii liquidity framework accordingly at this point it is premature to assess its impact 

federal deposit insurance act 

deposit insurance 

the fdic’s dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits which insurance is funded through assessments on banks like keybank during the period of 20072010 higher bank failures dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the dif pursuant to the doddfrank act the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased permanently from 100000 to 250000 per depository and the coverage of noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts is unlimited effective from december 31 2010 to december 31 2012 

deposit insurance assessments 

substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums the doddfrank act required the fdic to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and requires the dif reserve ratio to increase to 135 by september 30 2020 under the final rule which was effective on april 1 2011 keybank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its new assessment base depending on its new scorecard performance factors that will incorporate keybank’s regulatory rating ability to withstand asset and funding related stress and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure we estimate that our 2012 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be 45 million to 60 million 

conservatorship and receivership of institutions 

upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed the conservator or receiver under the fdia in such an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which such 

  

institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by the other party to the contract against the receivership or conservatorship the amount paid upon such claim would depend upon among other factors the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and the priority of the claim relative to the priority of others in addition the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision regarding termination default acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution the fdic as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors 

the above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of key’s bank subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions such as keybank including without limitation obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors in the public markets 

under the doddfrank act the fdic may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation of a systemically important financial institution the fdic has adopted certain rules to implement its orderly liquidation authority as keycorp has over 50 billion in assets we are subject to these requirements 

depositor preference 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company such as keycorp and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

the bank secrecy act 

the bank secrecy act the “bsa” requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things establish a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism the bsa includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligenceknowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsa requirements 

bank transactions with affiliates 

federal banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in our common shares or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry described below are certain risks and uncertainties the occurrence of which could have a material and 

  

adverse effect on us before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations andor access to liquidity andor credit could be materially and adversely affected “material adverse effect on us” if this were to happen the value of our securities — common shares series a preferred stock trust preferred securities and debt securities — could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

our enterprise risk management program the “erm program” identifies key’s major risk categories including market compliance credit liquidity and operational together with reputation and strategic risks as they relate to the foregoing the following risk factors are grouped into categories consistent with the five preceding main categories of risk focused on in our erm program with an additional category for risks related to investment in our common shares 

i market risks 

the global financial markets continue to be strained as a result of the economic slowdown abroad and concerns about the creditworthiness of member states of the european union these factors could have international implications which could hinder the us economic recovery and affect the stability of global financial markets 

certain european union member states have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue which has caused investor concern over such countries’ ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth in their economies during 2011 the european debt crisis caused spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets and liquidity to be less abundant the european debt crisis and measures adopted to address it have significantly weakened european economies a weaker european economy may cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of european financial institutions and the stability of european member economies a failure to adequately address sovereign debt concerns in europe could hamper economic recovery or contribute to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the financial markets including in the united states should the us economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors the likelihood for loan and asset growth at us financial institutions like key would deteriorate 

the us economy remains vulnerable as the economic recovery continues to progress slowly 

the recovery of the us economy continues to progress slowly with improvement expected to continue gradually into 2012 and 2013 according to the federal open market committee the “fomc” certain downside risks to the us economy remain present strains in the global financial markets pose significant downside risk to the us economy unemployment the slowing pace of business fixed investment and the depressed housing sector are additional factors of concern the us economy could also be affected by the slowdown in economic activity abroad often related to fiscal tightening and the significant fiscal challenges that remain for local governments in the us the continuation or worsening of these factors could weaken the us economic recovery underway the downgrade of us treasury securities by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” and political difficulties in addressing the economy within the us government have contributed to high levels of volatility in the financial markets should economic indicators deteriorate the us could face another recession which could affect us in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways as well as affect our borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations we have taken steps since the 20082009 financial crisis to strengthen our liquidity position nevertheless a return of the volatile economic 

  

conditions recently experienced including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets for an extended period of time particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our earnings on loans and other interestearning assets 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings we use simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet changes customer behavior new products new business volume product pricing competitor behavior the behavior of market interest rates and anticipated hedging activities simulation analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future risks and trends accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes actual hedging strategies employed changes in balance sheet composition and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events 

although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on us 

ii compliance risks 

the regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states including the doddfrank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

the united states as well as other governments have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry we expect to face increased regulation of our industry as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus financial market stability and enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and new efforts designed to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse we also expect more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels particularly due to both keybank’s and keycorp’s status as covered institutions for the enhanced prudential standards promulgated under the doddfrank act compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase our cost and reduce our revenue and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities 

many parts of the doddfrank act are now in effect while others are in an implementation stage likely to continue for several years the law requires that regulators some of which are new regulatory bodies created by the doddfrank act draft review and approve more than 300 implementing regulations and conduct numerous studies that are likely to lead to more regulations thus extending the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act on us 

  

a number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies including key conduct their business 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 it is clear that the reforms both under the doddfrank act and otherwise will have a significant effect on our entire industry although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects at this stage we believe compliance with the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis and may also limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to our businesses result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses additionally reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that we deal with in the course of our business such as rating agencies insurance companies and investors heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations resulting from the dodd frank act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds the dif and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things 

changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on us such changes will subject us to additional costs may limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer as well as the investments that we may make and the manner in which we operate our businesses these changes may increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products and could make them more attractive alternatives to customers failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or selfregulatory organizations civil money penalties financial loss andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or a failure to establish appropriate controls or to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us 

iii  credit risks 

should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector are improving but remain relatively weak under continuing pressure by reduced asset values high vacancies and reduced rents commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of 2007 after gaining approximately 30 since 2005 and 90 since 2001 according to moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property index november 2011 commercial real estate values were down 42 from their peak a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans these properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases which may also lead to existing lease turnover 

the us economy remains highly vulnerable and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the nascent recovery in commercial real estate the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents has continued to lag behind the overall economy or not occur at all these economic factors typically affect certain industries such as real estate and financial services more significantly to illustrate this point improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by 12 to 18 months our clients include entities active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time it could have a material adverse effect on us should fundamentals deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income it could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a failure to sustain reduced amounts of provision credit for loan and lease losses and provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments which has benefitted results of operation in recent periods could result in decreases in net income 

as was typical in the banking industry the economic downturn that started in 2007 resulted in key experiencing elevated levels of provision for loan and lease losses and provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments “provision” in the quarters from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2010 key’s provision for credit losses ranged from 847 million to 218 million for such quarters subsequently in part due to improvement in economic conditions as well as actions taken by us to manage our portfolio key’s provision declined substantially and in some quarters was a negative provision reaching an inflection point in the third quarter of 2010 when a negative provision of 88 million was recorded this decline in the provision has been a major contributor to our ability to maintain and grow our net income during this period if our provision were to rise back towards levels experienced during the height of the economic downturn it would have an adverse effect on our net income and could result in lower levels of net income than we have reported in recent periods 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

during the recent recession from december 2007 to june 2009 the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels the severe market dislocations in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining of the credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable for example a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks incurred in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses should such additional provisions become necessary they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to credit risk in the form of changes in interest rates andor changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate which changes could adversely affect us 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we 

  

operate increases in interest rates andor further weakening of economic conditions caused by another recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 70 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so however our loan portfolio still contains a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances 

we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmentalrelated covenants which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law we take steps to mitigate risks however should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants our credit quality could be adversely affected the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located — the rocky mountains and northwest the great lakes and the northeast — as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets outside of our footprint real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions certain markets such as florida southern california phoenix arizona and las vegas nevada experienced more significant deterioration during the recession real estate values in these markets in particular remain depressed the delinquencies nonperforming loans and chargeoffs that we have experienced since 2007 have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources and in turn may have a material adverse effect on us 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we measure monitor and mitigate our counterparty risks to reduce the risk of these exposures these measures include daily position measurement and reporting the use of scenario analysis and stress testing replacement cost estimation risk mitigation strategies and market feedback validation financial services institutions however are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients during 2008 key incurred 54 million 

  

of derivativerelated charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of lehman brothers another example of losses related to this type of risk are the losses associated with the bernie madoff ponzi scheme “madoff ponzi scheme” as a result of the madoff ponzi scheme our investment subsidiary austin determined that its funds had suffered investment losses up to 186 million 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us it is not possible to anticipate all of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks completely there can be no assurance that our erm program will effectively mitigate these risks in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a negative impact on us accordingly these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

iv liquidity risks 

capital requirements imposed by the doddfrank act together with new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the basel committee will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case 

new and evolving capital standards both as a result of the doddfrank act and the implementation of new capital standards adopted by the basel committee including the socalled “basel iii” accord will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies including key basel iii among other things narrows the definition of regulatory capital and establishes higher minimum riskbased capital ratios that when fully phasedin will require banking organizations including key to maintain a minimum tier 1 common ratio of 45 a tier 1 capital ratio of 60 and a total capital ratio of 80 a capital conservation buffer of 25 above each of these levels also is required which potentially may be supplemented by an additional countercyclical capital buffer in addition basel iii introduces new shortterm liquidity and term funding standards as well as a newlydefined leverage ratio the capital standards adopted by the basel committee and expected to be implemented in the united states increase the capital requirements for specific types of exposures and require that unconsolidated investments in financial entities mortgage servicing rights and certain types of deferred tax assets above certain thresholds be deducted from regulatory capital 

implementation of the new basel iii capital and liquidity standards as well as any additional heightened capital or liquidity standards that may be established by the federal reserve under the doddfrank act remain subject to rulemaking in the us and in many cases to extended observation and phasein periods as part of the implementation of basel iii the federal reserve will promulgate rules providing for the phaseout of trust preferred securities as tier 1 riskbased capital for purposes of the regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies as required by the doddfrank act currently our trust preferred securities represent 104 of our tier 1 riskbased capital or 105 billion of tier 1 riskbased capital by comparison our noncumulative preferred equity and our tier 1 common equity represent 29 and 867 respectively of our tier 1 riskbased capital as of december 31 2011 the anticipated phaseout as eligible tier 1 riskbased capital of our trust preferred securities will eventually result in us having less of a capital buffer above the wellcapitalized regulatory standard of 6 of tier 1 riskbased capital the federal reserve has indicated that it may make revisions to the basel iii liquidity standards the full effect of these standards on key is uncertain at this time 

the need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand either organically or through acquisitions it could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability 

  

to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid shortterm investments thereby reducing our ability to invest in longerterm assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective moreover although these new requirements are being phased in over time us federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements including under stressed conditions in approving actions that represent uses of capital such as dividend increases and share repurchases 

there can be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government to restore longterm liquidity and stability to the us financial system and reform financial regulation in the us will help stabilize the us financial system 

since 2008 the federal government has intervened in an unprecedented manner in an effort to provide stability and liquidity to the financial markets the federal reserve is currently maintaining a variety of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy these policy measures have been maintained by the fomc over the last few years as economic growth unemployment and inflation have not been at levels mandated for the fomc to achieve 

market liquidity issues have been alleviated somewhat but us economic indicators continue to present challenges for overall growth at levels mandated for the fomc to achieve and the us economy remains vulnerable there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that these government initiatives will have on the financial markets the failure of the us government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the us economy on a stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening of current financial market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on us for example during the liquidity crisis from late 2007 to 2009 regional financial institutions like key faced difficulties issuing debt in the fixed income debt markets these conditions could return and pose difficulties for the issuance of both mediumterm note and longterm subordinated note issuances in the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets return or become exacerbated there may be a material adverse effect on us from i continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets ii continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically iii limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system or iv further recessionary conditions 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank our largest subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to us during 2008 2009 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011 keybank did not pay any dividends to us nonbank subsidiaries paid us 25 million in dividends during 2010 and 45 million in dividends during 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2011 keybank paid 300 million in dividends to keycorp as it had sufficient capacity to pay dividends under its earnings retention test which requires keybank to only pay dividends from retained earnings generated over the most recent two full years plus the current year period at january 1 2012 keybank has capacity to pay 13 billion in dividends to keycorp under applicable supervisory guidance tests for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation — capital” of this report 

also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we are subject to changes in the financial markets which could adversely affect us 

traditionally market factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates interest rate levels and credit spreads changes in the equity markets and changes in the financial soundness of bond insurers sureties and other unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect current market values of financial instruments during 2008 market events demonstrated this to an extreme between july 2007 and october 2009 conditions in the fixed income markets specifically the wider credit spreads over benchmark us treasury securities for many fixed income securities caused significant volatility in the market values of loans securities and certain other financial instruments that are held in our trading or heldforsale portfolios during the second half of 2010 credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the fixed income debt markets ameliorated with the conclusion of the recession and the beginning of the gradual recovery as 2011 progressed the european debt crisis caused credit spreads to widen and the availability of liquidity in the fixed income debt markets to be somewhat less abundant than during the second half of 2010 opportunities to minimize the adverse affects of market changes are not always available substantial changes in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of which are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry the financial markets and the economy there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings on december 6 2011 sp announced a ratings review of 31 north american regional banks and their subsidiaries under its new bank ratings criteria announced november 9 2011 sp’s updated its ratings outlook on both keycorp and keybank from “stable” to “positive” and maintained the ratings for keycorp and keybank sp’s ratings for keycorp’s shortterm borrowings and senior longterm debt are a2 and bbb respectively and keybank’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt are rated a2 a and bbb respectively 

in light of the various changes in the ratings methodologies underway as a result of the doddfrank act there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings if the securities of keycorp andor keybank suffer ratings downgrades such downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us thereby reducing our ability to generate income downgrades of the credit ratings of securities particularly if they are below investmentgrade could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2009 credit markets have improved since then and we have significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth exiting certain noncore lending businesses diversifying our funding base maintaining a liquid asset portfolio and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity many of these disrupted markets have shown signs of 

  

recovery throughout 2011 nonetheless if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time should our funding needs necessitate it we may need to expand our use of other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available under certain stressed conditions experienced in the liquidity crisis during 20072009 some of these alternative means of funding were not available should these forms of funding become unavailable it is unclear what impact given current economic conditions unavailability of such funding would have on us a deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect on us 

v operational risks 

we are subject to operational risk 

we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct certain of our business activities we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems both internal and provided by third parties to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if any does occur that it will be adequately addressed we also maintain commercially reasonable measures to ensure cybersecurity of our information systems other financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyber attacks and other means 

given the rapidly expanding and changing cybersecurity threat landscape that exists today it is not commercially reasonable to expect that some sort of cybersecurity incident will never occur to key or the systems of any thirdparty providers key relies upon including overseas providers this is particularly true because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and attacks can originate from a wide array of sources including third parties outside the company such as persons involved in organized crimes or associated with external service providers those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our offerings of mobile payments and other internet or webbased products 

  

a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our own systems or thirdparty providers’ systems could cause serious negative consequences for key including significant disruption of our operations misappropriation of confidential information of the company or that of our customers or damage to our computers or operating systems or those of our customers and counterparties we have adjusted our cybersecurity program to anticipate that a breach is more likely and have put a greater focus on detection and incident response should these measures be insufficient fail or be breached our operations could be adversely affected possibly materially the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems including a cybersecurity breach of our systems implemented to protect our information systems security could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

maintaining or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices for our products and services 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and smart phones requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks using smart phones utilizing paypal or a financial account associated with a smart phone there is increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace with evolving preferences of consumers and businesses payment methods and financial service providers have evolved as the advancement of technology has made possible the delivery of financial products and services through different mediums and providers such as smart phones and paypal accounts thereby increasing competitive pressure in the delivery of financial products and services the adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify our existing products and services furthermore we might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval or sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base the introduction of new products and services has the potential to introduce risk which in turn can present challenges to us in operating within our risk tolerances while also achieving growth in our market share in addition there is increasing pressure from our competitors to deliver products and services at lower prices the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have an adverse impact on us these factors could reduce our revenues from our net interest margin and feebased products and services and have a material adverse effect on us 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in recent years while the breadth of the institutions that we compete with has increased competition has intensified as a result of consolidation efforts since 2009 competition has intensified as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to further redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to strong and large financial institutions we expect this trend to continue the competitive 

  

landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies during the liquidity crisis due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity the financial services industry’s competitive landscape could become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including 

 

       failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

our earnings andor financial condition may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws or the interpretation of them 

changes in or reinterpretations of us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on us although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could impact our financial statements thus affecting our performance ratios 

like all businesses we are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred tax assets the carrying value of these assets is dependent upon earnings forecasts and prior period earnings a significant change in our assumptions could affect the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including 

 

           

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal actions against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry the legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act the creation of the cfpb and the uncertainty as to whether federal preemption of certain state consumer laws remains intact for federally chartered financial institutions like keybank and keycorp present additional legal risk to the financial services industry including key furthermore we like other members of the banking industry may face additional regulatory and legal actions from state attorneys general the cfpb and other parties related to consumer rights there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any reputation damage from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on us 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want andor need to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position our performance including our competitive position could suffer and in turn have a material adverse effect on us although we have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse effect on us 

various restrictions on compensation of certain executive offers were imposed under the recovery act the doddfrank act and other legislation or regulations our ability to attract andor retain talented executives andor relationship managers may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us 

vi risks to our common shares 

you may not receive dividends on the common shares 

holders of our common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments furthermore our common shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding as of february 17 2012 there were 2904839 shares of keycorp’s series a preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 100 per share issued and outstanding 

we paid a quarterly dividend on our common shares for each quarter of 2011 as long as our series a preferred stock is outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions these factors could adversely affect the market price of our common shares also keycorp is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends 

in addition terms of keybank’s outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on keycorp’s capital stock including its common shares or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture if we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

our share price can be volatile 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common shares when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including 

 

          

       any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

our common shares are not a bank deposit and therefore are not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

 economic overview 

economic and political uncertainty and financial market volatility were the dominant themes throughout 2011 the year began with optimism that the economic recovery in the united states was finally gaining momentum three years after the financial crisis of 2008 sparked the worst recession since the great depression that optimism quickly faded during the first quarter of 2011 after multiple economic shocks interrupted the recovery first political unrest in north africa and the middle east resulted in volatility in oil and gas prices lessening the consumer’s discretionary purchasing power then the natural disasters in japan created manufacturing supply chain disruptions which slowed us industrial production and growth finally awareness of the sovereign debt crisis in europe increased and financial market volatility heightened equity markets reeled over fears that fiscal austerity in europe would lead to a weakening of their banking sector and european leaders were unable to allay those concerns the environment was further intensified by the us debt ceiling debate that ultimately led to the historic downgrade of the united states’ aaa credit rating by standard  poor’s 

us employers added 182 million jobs in 2011 this compares favorably to the 1 million jobs added in 2010 the unemployment rate in december of 2011 decreased to 85 compared to the 94 rate at the end of 2010 while the unemployment rate showed improvement throughout the year it remained considerably higher than the tenyear average unemployment rate of 65 despite the improving job market us consumers whose confidence had been rattled by the news headlines throughout the year were hesitant to spend the average monthly rate of consumer spending increased 03 for 2011 compared to an average monthly increase of 04 for 2010 spending was also tempered by rising inflationary pressures as consumer prices in december of 2011 increased at an annual rate of 30 up from the 15 increase for all of 2010 

the housing market remained weak throughout 2011 and continued to be a drag on the recovery in december of 2011 new home sales decreased 7 from december of 2010 while the median price of new homes decreased by 13 over the same period building activity improved modestly as housing starts at the end of 2011 increased 25 from a year earlier but still remained at historically low levels existing home sales also remained weak as lower mortgage rates and price discounts were not enough to lure buyers back into the market in december of 2011 existing home sales increased 4 from the same month a year ago and the median price of existing homes decreased by 3 over the same period while remaining historically elevated the number of new foreclosures decreased 20 in december of 2011 from a year earlier 

the federal reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero and took further accommodative monetary policy actions in 2011 the federal reserve continued to expand its holdings of treasury securities during the first half of the year as announced in november of 2010 as the economic outlook weakened in the second half of 2011 the federal reserve attempted to increase its transparency in august by stating that it would keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid2013 the federal reserve updated this communication in january of 2012 to indicate that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014 furthermore in an attempt to lower longerterm borrowing rates to consumers and businesses the federal reserve announced a program in september dubbed operation twist by investors this program involves the federal reserve purchasing 400 billion of u s treasury securities with longer maturities 

  

while selling the same amount of u s treasury securities with shorter maturities these actions along with the recognition of a weakening global economy contributed to a drop in benchmark term interest rates the benchmark twoyear us treasury yield declined from 060 at december 31 2010 to 024 at december 30 2011 the tenyear us treasury yield which began the year at 330 decreased by 142 to close 2011 at 188 the sp 500 equity index which had been up over 8 for the year through april of 2011 and then down almost 13 for the year through october of 2011 ended the year approximately unchanged

 highlights of our 2011 performance 

financial performance 

for 2011 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 857 million or 92 per common share these results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 413 million or 47 per common share for 2010 

figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years 

  

figure 3 results of operations 

 

  

  

  

 the earnings improvement in 2011 resulted from an improvement in credit quality expense control and our success in growing our business when compared to 2010 results in 2009 were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses writeoffs of certain intangible assets and writedowns of certain commercial real estate related investments 

in 2011 we benefited from the actions taken to strengthen our balance sheet reduce risk reposition our business and rebuild capital our 2011 full year results lead us to believe that we have returned to solid and sustainable profitability reached an inflection point in our loan portfolio and have established peer leading capital levels 

in 2012 we will continue to focus on cost control efforts as we invest in client facing positions and technology continue to optimize our nonclient facing positions and occupancy costs expend for marketing where we can deepen client relationships to improve future revenue and implement efficiency initiatives 

the net interest margin from continuing operations was 316 for 2011 this was a decrease of ten basis points from 2010 this decrease was primarily attributable to a lower yield on average earning assets compared to the prior year resulting primarily from the continuation of the low rate environment we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts this benefit along with reductions in administered rate deposits allowed us to maintain the spread between interest earning assets and our cost of funds during 2011 compared to 2010 our expectation for 2012 is for the net interest margin to show modest improvement as we continue to anticipate our funding costs to decline 

average total loans increased 656 million during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2011 this represented a 14 unannualized increase from the third quarter of 2011 and is the first time we have grown 

  

quarterly average loan balances since the fourth quarter of 2008 the average balances of commercial financial and agricultural loans increased from 174 billion to 183 billion or approximately 54 unannualized this is the third consecutive quarter average growth for the commercial financial and agricultural portfolio our utilization rate of commercial financial and agricultural loans improved from 444 in the third quarter of 2011 to 463 in the fourth quarter of 2011 this confirmed our belief that we reached an inflection point for loan growth in the third quarter of 2011 

our exit loan portfolio accounted for 119 million or 1385 of our nonperforming assets at december 31 2011 compared to 210 million or 157 at december 31 2010 and 599 million or 239 at december 31 2009 while we have made progress in decreasing our exit loan portfolio we believe these loan balances will be running down more slowly in the future due to the longer term nature of these remaining loan portfolios 

our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was 87 for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 90 for the fourth quarter of 2010 this continued decline was accomplished by growing our noninterestbearing deposits now and money market accounts reducing our reliance on wholesale funding exiting nonrelationship businesses and soft loan demand during the first half of 2011 

we originated new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses of approximately 105 billion during the fourth quarter and 366 billion for 2011 this annual amount compares to approximately 295 billion in 2010 an increase of 24 

our trend of improving the mix of deposits continued during 2011 where we experienced a 54 billion or 119 increase in nontime deposits approximately 68 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december 31 2011 will mature over the next four quarters and included in these totals are approximately 25 billion of higher costing certificates of deposit originated prior to 2009 the breakdown of these higher costing certificates of deposits is as follows 

 

  

  

  

 these repricing opportunities will continue to benefit our net interest margin 

we experienced an improvement in our asset quality statistics during the fourth quarter of 2011 net chargeoffs declined to 541 million or 111 of average loan balances for 2011 as compared to 16 billion and 291 for 2010 in addition our nonperforming loans declined to 727 million or 147 of period end loans at december 31 2011 compared to 11 billion or 213 at december 31 2010 our reserve for loan losses stood at 1 billion or 203 of period end loans compared to 16 billion or 320 at december 31 2010 and represented 138 and 150 coverage of nonperforming loans at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively also criticized loans outstanding declined at december 31 2011 for the 10th consecutive quarter information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “credit risk management” looking to 2012 we anticipate continued improvement in asset quality with lower levels of nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs for the year specifically with respect to net chargeoffs during the first half of 2012 we anticipate the amount to be comparable to the second half of 2011 

we anticipate the provision to be less than net chargeoffs in 2012 however we expect that as loan growth continues in 2012 we will migrate during the course of the year for the provision to be closer to the level of net chargeoffs there are a number of variables that impact the ultimate outcome including the composition of the loan portfolio at each quarterend 

  

our tangible common equity ratio and tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at december 31 2011 at 988 and 1126 respectively as compared to 819 and 934 at december 31 2010 these have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group on these ratios we have identified four primary uses of capital the first is investing in our businesses supporting our clients and our loan growth second is maintaining or increasing our common stock dividend third is to return capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders and then fourth is to be disciplined and opportunistic about how we could invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of our capital plan under the comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process until such time as they have completed their review and have no objection to our plan we are not able to take any further actions to implement our plan in the event the federal reserve would object to our plan in whole or in part we may submit a request for reconsideration of our plan within 10 days which the federal reserve is required to respond to within 10 days in such circumstances absent receipt of a nonobjection following a request for reconsideration we would be required to resubmit our plan within 30 days upon receipt of a resubmitted capital plan the federal reserve has 75 days to notify the bhc of its objection or nonobjection should we receive an objection it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year 

on january 11 2012 we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in buffalo and rochester ny the deposits associated with these branches total approximately 24 billion while loans total approximately 400 million we plan to use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth 

we are looking for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network in 2012 we plan to build approximately 20 new branches as compared to 40 new branches in 2011 our focus will shift more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint into more attractive market areas over the last two years we have built 79 new branches which net of closures and consolidations resulted in a net addition to our network of 51 branches in addition we have renovated approximately 129 branches during this time period in total approximately 40 of our branches are either new or have been renovated in the past five years as part of our branch modernization initiative 

figure 4 presents certain nongaap financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “tier 1 common equity” the tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors we believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations since the commencement of the ccar process in early 2009 the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity a nongaap financial measure because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories this increased focus on tier 1 common equity is also present in the basel committee’s basel iii guidelines which us regulators are expected to implement in the near future the enactment of the doddfrank act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier 1 eligible capital this three year phaseout period which commences january 1 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier 2 capital 

tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 4 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

  

the table also shows the computation for preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

 results of operations 

net interest income 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

  

   

  

 to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past six years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2011 was 23 billion and the net interest margin was 316 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 25 billion and a net interest margin of 326 for the prior year the decrease in 2011 net interest income is primarily attributable to a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year resulting primarily from pay downs on higher yielding loans and the continuation of the low rate environment decreasing the value of noninterest bearing liabilities we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts we have also benefitted from pricing reductions on administered rate deposits 

average earning assets for 2011 totaled 73 billion which was 55 billion or 7 lower than the 2010 level this reduction reflects a 54 billion decrease in loans during the year caused by soft demand for credit paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients deleveraged and the runoff in our exit portfolios 

the size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during 2011 2010 and 2009

 noninterest income 

noninterest income for 2011 was 18 billion down 146 million or 7 from 2010 in 2010 noninterest income decreased by 81 million or 4 compared to 2009 

noninterest income for 2011 decreased 92 million as compared to 2010 when excluding the gain realized from the sale of tuition management systems along with income generated by the business unit during 2010 totaling 54 million operating lease income decreased 51 million due to product runoff deposit service charges decreased 20 million during 2011 reflecting the fullyear impact of the implementation of regulation e in the third quarter of 2010 favorable results from letter of credit and loan fees and net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests were more than offset by declines in trust and investment services income corporateowned life insurance income net securities gains insurance income and investment banking and capital market income 

noninterest income for 2010 increased by 205 million as compared to 2009 when excluding the several significant items that affected noninterest income in 2009 in 2009 these items included net gains of 125 million from repositioning of the securities portfolio 78 million recorded in connection with the exchange of common shares for capital securities 32 million from the sale of our claim associated with the lehman brothers’ bankruptcy and a 105 million gain from the sale of visa inc shares 

as shown in figure 7 we benefited from a 187 million increase in investment banking and capital market income 76 million in net gains from loan sales in 2010 compared to a 1 million loss in 2009 and 66 million in net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2010 compared to a 4 million loss in 2009 these favorable results were partially offset by a 79 million decline in net gains on the sale of leased equipment 

  

figure 7 noninterest income 

 

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

trust and investment services income 

trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income the primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in figure 8 the 2011 and 2010 decreases of 10 million or 2 and 15 million or 3 respectively are primarily attributable to lower fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and institutional asset management and custody fees the increase in personal asset management and custody fees is largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional asset management and custody fees 

figure 8 trust and investment services income 

 

 a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2011 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 517 billion compared to 598 billion at december 31 2010 as shown in figure 9 the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in the equity and securities lending portfolios the decline in the equity portfolio was due in part to asset outflows and market value declines the decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of austin results included in discontinued operations our securities lending business has been declining due to our deemphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes client departures and fewer assets under management 

  

figure 9 assets under management 

 

  

  

 service charges on deposit accounts 

the decreases in service charges on deposit accounts in both 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the implementation of regulation e pursuant to the electronic fund transfer act of 1978 which went into effect on july 1 2010 for new clients and august 15 2010 for our existing clients partially offset by core deposit account growth 

operating lease income 

operating lease income recorded in our equipment finance line of business decreased 51 million during 2011 and decreased 54 million in 2010 compared to the prior years due to product runoff accordingly as shown in figure 11 operating lease expense also declined 

investment banking and capital markets income loss 

as shown in figure 10 income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased 11 million in 2011 other investment income increased 15 million from 2010 resulting from gains on sale of certain investments made by our real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business in key corporate bank dealer trading and derivative losses increased 6 million from 2010 as a decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives was more than offset by an increase related to credit default swap valuation adjustments also impacting this line item was a 24 million charge resulting from visa’s late fourth quarter announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit investment banking income decreased 20 million compared to 2010 due primarily to decreased levels of equity financings and advisor fees 

the 2010 increase as compared to 2009 was driven by lower losses from changes in the fair value of certain commercial real estate related investments totaling 109 million made by our real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business in key corporate bank we also experienced a 54 million decrease in losses associated with dealer trading and derivatives due largely to a 36 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives and a 14 million decrease related to credit default swap valuation adjustments investment banking income also increased 29 million due primarily to increased levels of debt and equity financings 

  

figure 10 investment banking and capital markets income loss 

 

  

  

 corporateowned life insurance income 

the 16 million or 12 decrease in our 2011 corporateowned life insurance income results primarily from the impact of a nonrecurring 12 million bonus dividend received in 2010 

net gains losses from loan sales 

we sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles of the overall loan portfolio net gains from loan sales remained relatively unchanged during 2011 compared to 2010 while 2009 results were impacted by distressed market conditions the types of loans sold during 2011 and 2010 are presented in figure 20 

net gains losses from principal investing 

principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privatelyheld companies our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to mediumsized businesses these investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 709 million at december 31 2011 and 898 million at december 31 2010 during the first half of 2011 employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward under this arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties these individuals are no longer employees of key as a result of these changes which were made during the second quarter of 2011 we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments totaling 234 million the net gains losses presented in figure 7 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments 

noninterest expense 

as shown in figure 11 noninterest expense for 2011 was 28 billion down 244 million or 8 from 2010 in 2010 noninterest expense declined by 520 million or 15 from 2009 

in 2011 personnel expense increased by 49 million driven by higher levels of incentive compensation nonpersonnel expense decreased 293 million due primarily to a 72 million decrease in the fdic assessment a 55 million decrease in net oreo expense a 48 million decrease in operating lease expense due to product runoff as well as favorable reductions across several expense categories as a result of our expense management efforts these favorable results were partially offset by the provision for unfunded commitments which was a credit of 28 million in 2011 compared to a credit of 48 million in 2010 

  

in 2010 personnel expense decreased by 43 million from 2009 excluding intangible assets impairment charges of 241 million nonpersonnel expense decreased by 279 million due primarily to a 53 million decrease in the fdic deposit insurance assessment a 53 million decrease in operating lease expense a 29 million decrease in costs associated with oreo and a 48 million credit recorded to the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments recorded during 2010 compared to a 67 million expense recorded for 2009 more information about the intangible assets impairment charges is provided in this section under the heading “intangible assets impairment” 

figure 11 noninterest expense 

 

  

 the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change 

personnel 

as shown in figure 12 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense increased by 49 million or 3 in 2011 following a 43 million or 3 decline in 2010 from 2009 the 2011 increase was due largely to a 40 million increase in incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability employee benefits expense increased 5 million due to increased medical plan expenses salaries expense increased 6 million due to higher levels of contract labor as the reduction in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees offset the impact of base salary increases severance expense also increased by 5 million while stockbased compensation decreased by 7 million 

the 2010 decrease was due largely to a 79 million decrease in our employee benefits expense the employee benefit expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our cash balance pension plan to freeze future service benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions for more information related to our pension plans see note 19 “employee benefits” the decrease in employee benefits expense was partially offset by 44 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability 

  

figure 12 personnel expense 

 

  

 intangible assets impairment 

during the third quarter of 2009 we recorded a 45 million charge to writeoff intangible assets other than goodwill associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets during the first quarter of 2009 we determined that the estimated fair value of our key corporate bank reporting unit was less than the carrying amount reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets as a result we recorded a pretax noncash accounting charge of 223 million of which 27 million related to the discontinued operations of austin as a result of this charge all of the goodwill that had been assigned to key corporate bank has been written off 

operating lease expense 

the decrease in operating lease expense in both 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 7 as “operating lease income” 

fdic assessment 

fdic assessment expense decreased in 2011 as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “deposits and other sources of funds” section under the “the doddfrank act reform of deposit insurance” heading fdic assessment expense was unfavorably impacted in 2009 primarily by a one time special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009 this increase was partially offset by opting out of the temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” transaction account guarantee “tag” program effective july 1 2010 

oreo expense 

improved liquidity for income producing properties that began in 2010 and carried through into 2011 resulted in a 8 million increase in net gains on sale of oreo in 2011 compared to the year ago while valuation writedowns decreased 43 million oreo expense decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily as a result of 7 million in net gains on sale recorded in 2010 compared to net loss on sales of 26 million in 2009 

provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 

the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments fluctuated during the years shown as a result of variability in underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments 

income taxes 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 369 million for 2011 compared to a tax provision of 186 million for 2010 and a tax benefit of 1035 billion for 2009 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 274 for 2011 compared to 234 for 2010 and 450 for 2009 

  

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves 

during 2010 we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of 32 million as the result of management’s change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in nonus subsidiaries in 2009 we recorded a 106 million credit to income taxes due primarily to the settlement of irs audits for the tax years 19972006 the credit includes a final adjustment of 80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues 

line of business results 

this section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments operating segments key community bank and key corporate bank during the first quarter of 2010 we realigned our reporting structure for our business segments prior to 2010 consumer finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or runoff portfolios and were included in our key corporate bank segment effective for all periods presented we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in other segments the automobile dealer floor plan business previously included in consumer finance has been realigned with the commercial banking line of business within the key community bank segment in addition other previously identified exit portfolios included in the key corporate bank segment have been moved to other segments note 21 “line of business results” describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business and explains “other segments” and “reconciling items” 

figure 13 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxableequivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income loss from continuing operations attributable to key” for each of the past three years

key community bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 14 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 213 million for 2011 compared to net income of 155 million for 2010 and a net loss of 68 million for 2009 the increase in 2011 was the result of improvement in the provision for loan and lease losses 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 130 million or 8 from 2010 as a result of a decline in average deposits and tighter deposit spreads average loans and leases declined by 736 million or 3 due to reductions in the commercial and home equity portfolios additionally average deposits declined 18 billion or 4 a 54 billion reduction in cd balances were partially offset by growth in noninterest bearing and now accounts which reflects changes in client preferences and liquidity levels among both consumer and business clients additionally higherpriced cds originated in prior years have continued to mature and reprice at prevailing market rates 

noninterest income decreased by 26 million or 3 from 2010 due in part to a decline of 16 million in service charges on deposits from the implementation of regulation e insurance income from the bankbased brokerage key investment services also decreased 11 million which is reflective of the current market and interest rate environment letter of credit and loan fees also decreased 3 million from 2010 these declines were partially offset by a 4 million increase in trust and investment services income and increased syndication fees which is representative of continued collaboration with key corporate bank government pricing controls which limited debit card interchange fees effective october 1 2011 caused a 15 million fourth quarter decrease in debit card income confirming our previously reported 50 to 60 million estimated annualized decline to our debit interchange revenue stream 

the provision for loan and lease losses declined by 253 million or 61 from 2010 net charge offs have declined 223 million or 44 from 2010 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in credit quality of the portfolio 

noninterest expense remained flat compared to 2010 we experienced a 66 million decline in fdic deposit insurance premiums which was partially offset by increases in the provision for unfunded commitments business services and professional fees reflecting the cost of our thirdparty mortgage operations and increased personnel and real estate costs which were commensurate with a continued investment in our branch network over the last two years we have built 79 new branches which net of closures and consolidations resulted in a net addition to our network of 51 branches in addition we have renovated approximately 129 branches during this time period in total approximately 40 of our branches are either new or have been renovated in the past five years as of our branch modernization initiative 

in 2010 the 223 million increase in net income attributable to key compared to 2009 was due to decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses of 318 million coupled with an increase in noninterest income of 14 million taxableequivalent net interest income decreased 104 million partially offsetting these positive results

 key corporate bank summary of operations 

as shown in figure 15 key corporate bank recorded net income from continuing operations attributable to key of 565 million for 2011 compared to net income of 424 million for 2010 and a net loss of 987 million for 2009 the 2011 improvement was primarily due to an increased credit in the provision for loan and lease losses as lower taxable equivalent net interest income was offset by improvements in noninterest income and noninterest expense 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 93 million or 12 in 2011 compared to 2010 this is primarily due to the deposit and borrowing spread which declined by 79 million or 28 this decline was driven by a reduction in the value of deposits resulting from historically low interest rates and the movement of 15 billion in escrow balances out of the real estate capital line of business to a third party in the first quarter of 2011 average earning assets fell by 31 billion or 14 due primarily to reductions in the real estate loan portfolios however strong commercial loan growth in the second half of 2011 resulted in a 483 million increase in period end loans from december 31 2010 lower average earning asset balances were offset by improved earning asset yields and an increase in loanrelated interest fees 

noninterest income increased by 27 million or 3 from 2010 due in part to increases of 22 million in letter of credit and loan fees and 39 million in gains on the disposition of certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business the growth in noninterest income was offset in part by a 15 million decrease in trust and investment services income related to a reduction in institutional asset management and custody fees and a 25 million decline in operating lease revenue 

the key corporate bank provision for loan and lease losses in 2011 was a credit of 198 million compared to a credit of 28 million in 2010 reflecting lower levels of net loan chargeoffs and a release of loss reserves due to improved credit quality net loan chargesoffs decreased 469 million from 2010 to 138 million in 2011 

noninterest expense declined by 121 million or 12 from 2010 due primarily to net oreo recoveries recorded in 2011 of 5 million versus 46 million in net oreo expense in 2010 further expense reductions were realized including a 21 million decline in operating lease expense on product runoff a 55 million decline in other various expense categories and a 16 million decline in internally allocated overhead and support costs these reductions were partially offset by a 43 million increase in personnel expense 

  

the 2010 improvement in net income from continuing operations attributable to key related to a decrease in the provision for loan losses an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in noninterest expense partially offset by a decrease in net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 74 million or 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased earning assets noninterest income increased 146 million or 21 driven by fair value adjustments on other real estate investments taken in 2009 and increased investment banking and debt placement fees the provision for loan and lease losses decreased 19 billion on improved credit quality noninterest expense decreased 251 million or 20 driven by the decreased provision for lending related commitments a decrease in intangible amortization expense decreased miscellaneous expense and the intangible asset impairment charge taken in 2009

 other segments 

other segments consists of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios that previously were included in the key corporate bank segment these exit portfolios were moved to other segments during the first quarter of 2010 prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current reporting of the financial information for each segment 

other segments generated net income attributable to key of 181 million for 2011 compared to net income attributable to key of less than 1 million for 2010 the 2010 results reflect a 15 million decrease in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of 278 million offset by various other items 

in 2010 other segments generated net income attributable to key of less than 1 million compared to a net loss attributable to key of 418 million for 2009 the 2009 results reflect a 273 million increase in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of 331 million offset by various other items

loans and loans held for sale 

figure 16 shows the composition of our loan portfolio at december 31 for each of the past five years 

figure 16 composition of loans 

 

   

at december 31 2011 total loans outstanding were 496 billion compared to 501 billion at the end of 2010 and 588 billion at the end of 2009 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 58 billion at december 31 2011 65 billion at december 31 2010 and 35 billion at december 31 2009 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section entitled “consumer loan portfolio” within this discussion the decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most of our portfolios with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans outstanding were 348 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 262 million or 1 since december 31 2010 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 16 our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represent 39 and 33 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and are the largest component of our total loans the loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans increased 29 billion or 18 from one year ago 

commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans represent approximately 19 of our total loan portfolio these loans include both owner and nonowneroccupied properties and constitute approximately 27 of our commercial loan portfolio as shown in figure 16 at december 31 2011 our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of 80 billion and construction loans of 13 billion the total commercial real estate loans for 2011 and 2010 represent 19 and 23 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represent 12 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represent 7 of our total loans the average size of mortgage loans originated during 2011 was 38 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2011 had a balance of 211 million at december 31 2011 our average construction loan commitment was 38 million our largest construction loan commitment was 56 million at december 31 2011 our largest construction loan outstanding was 481 million at december 31 2011 

our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 14state banking franchise and real estate capital and corporate banking services a national line of business within key corporate bank that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 56 of our average yeartodate commercial real estate loans during 2011 compared to 60 one year ago as shown in figure 17 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank 

  

figure 17 commercial real estate loans 

 

  

 during 2011 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 234 million attributable to improved asset quality and market conditions this compares to a decrease of 680 million during 2010 

for the period 2008 – 2010 the secondary market for incomeproperty loans was severely constrained during this period of time we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans beginning with the second half of 2010 and continuing throughout 2011 market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement consequently our clients’ need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowneroccupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances since december 31 2010 our nonowneroccupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately 18 billion or 23 

as shown in figure 17 at december 31 2011 65 of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 68 at december 31 2010 approximately 18 and 23 of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively typically construction properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases driving rental rates and occupancy rates down as we have experienced during 2011 we expect vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into 2012 

commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom and certain sectors eg apartments are showing signs of improvement according to property and portfolio research inc vacancy fell in the third quarter of 2011 in every major property type but it remained above yearago levels with the exception of apartments rent growth remains flat to negative again with the exception of apartments and is at or nearing a trough however modest declines are possible over the next year in office retail and warehouse property types once rents bottom the anticipated recovery will likely be modest 

  

if the economic recovery stalls andor job growth continues to disappoint vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain the resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components which comprise 23 of our commercial real estate loans 

commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007 having experienced increases of approximately 30 since 2005 and 90 since 2001 the most recent moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property price index november 2011 showed a 42 drop in values from the peak in october 2007 as of november 2011 the index was at 11136 a 137 increase from april 2011 april 2011 was the lowest point since the inception of the index in december of 2000 market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location over the past year competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative 

if the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market ie vacancy rates the stability of rental income and asset values leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 

commercial lease financing we conduct financing arrangements through our key equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 17 of commercial loans at december 31 2011 and 19 at december 31 2010 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or income sources 

modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance tdr classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions principal deferral or forgiveness of principal loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types as a result of improving economic conditions combined with the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower we have seen certain of our restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance under the restructured loan terms for each primary type of concession over the past year 

for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs see note 5 “asset quality” 

figure 18 quantifies restructured loans and tdrs 

  

figure 18 commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status 

 

  

 the benefits derived from ab note tdrs are recognized when the underlying assets predominantly commercial real estate have been stabilized with a level of leverage supportable by ongoing cash flows rightsizing the a note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition similarly appropriatelysized a notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset deleveraged and sustainable capital structure often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressedfire sales 

we use an ab note structure for tdrs breaking the existing loan into two tranches this approach has many benefits for us and for our borrowers 

first we create an a note as the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years 

appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status allowing us to resume recognizing interest income as the borrower’s payment performance improves these restructured notes also will allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification moreover the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically commercial real estate the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction and local markets are spared distressedfire sales 

the b note is typically an interestonly note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow this excess cash flow is customarily applied directly to the principal of the a note we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status in many cases the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 

all loans processed as a tdr including a notes and any nonchargedoff b notes are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 

  

returning an a note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time to that end our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments we evaluate primary repayment derived from property cash flow to assess continued sustainability secondary repayment collateral is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the a note with a sufficient excess generally 20 although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

extensions certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity however due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the marketwide decline in leasing activity and rental rates an increased number of loans have been extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for both the client and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms ie amortization covenants and term that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees andor a cash flow sweep as previously mentioned some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option pricing and loan terms cannot be altered most project loans by their nature are “collateraldependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan 

pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any therefore pricing may remain the same eg the loan is already priced at or above current market we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made—we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

guarantors a detailed guarantor analysis is conducted 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and near term debt maturities 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly in some cases disclosure of certain information including liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules may be required more frequently 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent in limited circumstances we would not seek to enforce the guaranty including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy andor it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment andor the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

as of december 31 2011 we had 119 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 10 and were accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or 

  

more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization ii a satisfactory borrower payment history and iii acceptable guarantor support 

consumer loan portfolio 

consumer loans outstanding decreased by 794 million or 5 from one year ago most of the decrease is attributable to our exit portfolio as shown in figure 39 in the “credit risk management” section which decreased by 636 million 

the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio approximately 95 of this portfolio at december 31 2011 is derived from our key community bank the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans from our key community bank decreased by 285 million or 3 over the past twelve months 

figure 19 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole 

figure 19 home equity loans 

 

  

 as previously reported we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio we expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealeroriginated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products we ceased originating new education loans effective december 5 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations 

in the latter half of 2010 there was public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders our number of home loan foreclosures is small the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by key and third parties initiated per month through december 31 2011 was 121 mortgage loans serviced by key and third parties outstanding at december 31 2011 were approximately 223000 loans and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio a review of our foreclosure processes completed in the first quarter of 2011 did not uncover any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits 

loans held for sale 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale increased to 728 million at december 31 2011 from 467 million at december 31 2010 loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business which are excluded from total loans held for sale at december 31 2010 totaled 15 million there were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at december 31 2011 

at december 31 2011 loans held for sale included 567 million of commercial mortgages which increased by 449 million from december 31 2010 and 95 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by 15 

  

million from december 31 2010 in the absence of quoted market prices we use valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost the models are based on thirdparty data as well as assumptions related to prepayment speeds default rates funding cost discount rates and other relevant market available inputs in light of the volatility in the financial markets we have reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect current market conditions as a result no significant adjustments to our assumptions were required during 2011 

during 2011 we recorded net unrealized losses of 32 million and net realized gains of 17 million on our loans held for sale portfolio these net gains are reported in “net gains losses from loan sales” on the income statement we have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry having exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006 

loan sales 

as shown in figure 20 during 2011 we sold 2 billion of commercial real estate loans 14 billion of residential real estate loans and 118 million of commercial loans most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio additionally there were no education loans sold included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet from figure 20 due to unfavorable market conditions we have not securitized any education loans since 2006 

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are

 in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 891 million of the 100 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2011 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

figure 22 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2011 approximately 33 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year

 securities 

our securities portfolio totaled 18 billion at december 31 2011 compared to 22 billion at december 31 2010 availableforsale securities were 16 billion at december 31 2011 compared to 219 billion at december 31 

  

2010 reflecting the liquidity needs arising from changes in our loan and deposit balances and investments in heldtomaturity securities heldtomaturity securities were 21 billion at december 31 2011 compared to 17 million at december 31 2010 primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgagebacked securities as we continue to prepare for potential future changes in regulatory capital rules at december 31 2011 we had 21 billion in cmos in our heldtomaturity securities portfolio 

as shown in figure 23 all of our mortgagebacked securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for more information about these securities see note 6 “fair value measurements” under the heading “qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques”

 securities available for sale 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of cmos which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities cmos generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements at december 31 2011 we had 159 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 217 billion at december 31 2010 

during 2011 we had net gains of 124 million from cmos and other mortgagebacked securities of which 126 million were net unrealized gains and 2 million were net realized losses the net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the aoci component of shareholders’ equity we continue to maintain a moderate assetsensitive interest rate risk position 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

throughout 2011 our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs for most of the first half of 2011 we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows and also sold approximately 16 billion of cmos these actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by key and rated by moody’s and also contributed to our preparations for tarp repayment in march 2011

 heldtomaturity securities 

federal agency cmos constitute most of our heldtomaturity securities along with foreign bonds and preferred equity securities the increase in our heldtomaturity securities was a result of purchases of federal agency cmos as we increased this portfolio in response to potential future changes in regulatory capital rules figure 25 shows the composition yields and remaining maturities of these securities

other investments 

principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 61 of other investments at december 31 2011 they include direct investments investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value 709 million at december 31 2011 and 898 million at december 31 2010 during the first half of 2011 employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward under this arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties these individuals are no longer employees of key as a result of these changes which were made during the second quarter of 2011 we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments totaling 234 million 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain real estaterelated investments that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information among other things our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry and third party data during 2011 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 78 million which includes 82 million of net unrealized gains these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement 

deposits and other sources of funds 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding during 2011 these deposits averaged 585 billion and represented 80 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 625 billion and 80 during 2010 the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 5 in the section entitled “net interest income” 

the decrease in average domestic deposits during 2011 compared to 2010 was due to a decline in certificates of deposit 100000 or more and other time deposits and was partially offset by an increase in now and money market deposit accounts and noninterestbearing deposits the mix of deposits continues to change as highercosting certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts such as now and money market savings accounts or look for other alternatives for investing in the current lowrate environment 

approximately 68 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december 31 2011 mature over the next four quarters and included in these totals are approximately 25 billion of higher costing certificates of deposit originated prior to 2009 the maturities of these certificates of deposit are as follows 238 million at a 495 cost mature in the first quarter of 2012 688 million at a 457 cost mature in the second quarter of 2012 1 billion at a 506 cost mature in the third quarter of 2012 and 529 million at a 488 cost mature in the fourth quarter of 2012 these repricing opportunities will benefit our net interest margin 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 34 billion during 2011 compared to 35 billion during 2010 the change from 2010 resulted from a 119 million decrease in foreign office deposits a 63 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and was partially offset by a 74 million increase in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings 

  

on january 11 2012 we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in buffalo and rochester ny the deposits associated with these branches total approximately 24 billion while loans total approximately 400 million we plan to use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth the transaction is expected to close in late second or early third quarter of 2012 

at december 31 2011 key had 47 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

 the doddfrank act’s reform of deposit insurance 

the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased permanently from 100000 to 250000 per depository and the coverage for noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts is unlimited effective from december 31 2010 to december 31 2012 pursuant to the doddfrank act accordingly since the beginning of 2011 keybank again offered noninterestbearing demand transaction accounts with unlimited fdic deposit insurance similar to when it participated in the tag program 

capital 

at december 31 2011 our shareholders’ equity was 99 billion down 12 billion from december 31 2010 the following discusses certain factors that contributed to the decline for other factors that contributed to the change see the consolidated statements of changes in equity 

as previously reported on january 1 2010 we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts classified as discontinued assets and liabilities as a result we consolidated our education loan securitization trusts and made a corresponding 45 million cumulative effect adjustment that consolidation added 28 billion in discontinued assets and the same amount of liabilities and equity to our balance sheet loans constituted 26 billion of the assets during the third quarter of 2011 we determined that the 45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on january 1 2010 was incorrect further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in note 13 “acquisition divestiture and discontinued operations” 

comprehensive capital assessment review and redemption notices for certain capital securities 

on january 9 2012 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ under the comprehensive capital analysis and review process our 20122013 comprehensive capital plan we are currently awaiting the results of this review 

on june 10 2011 we submitted to the federal reserve and provided to the occ an updated comprehensive capital plan which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities on august 1 2011 the federal reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan 

  

in august 2011 keycorp repurchased 226 million of capital securities issued by keycorp capital vii on september 1 2011 keycorp fully redeemed the following capital securities keycorp capital v keycorp capital vi keycorp capital viii and union state capital i during the fourth quarter of 2011 capital securities issued by union state statutory trust ii and union state statutory trust iv were redeemed on october 31 2011 and october 7 2011 respectively 

on october 31 2011 keycorp submitted notice to the property trustee for the redemption in full of the capital securities issued by keycorp capital ix such capital securities were redeemed on december 15 2011 

provisions of the doddfrank act provide for the phaseout of tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013 as a result the outstanding capital securities will eventually become tier 2 capital management continues to evaluate its options with respect to the remaining outstanding capital securities a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the implementation of basel iii which is expected to be published in the first half of 2012 this proposal is expected to include the phaseout of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital treatment 

repurchase of tarp cpp preferred stock warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings 

as previously reported key completed the repurchase of the 25 billion of series b preferred stock and corresponding warrant issued to the us treasury department as a result of the repurchase we recorded a 49 million onetime deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase beginning with the second quarter of 2011 the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of 31 million and discount amortization of 4 million or 140 million on an annual basis related to these preferred shares in total key paid 2867 billion to the us treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends principal and repurchase of the warrant resulting in a return to the us treasury of 367 million above the initial investment of 25 billion on november 14 2008 

dividends 

during the first quarter of 2011 we made dividend payments of 31 million to the us treasury on the series b preferred stock as a participant in the us treasury’s tarp cpp the repurchase of this preferred stock in march 2011 eliminated future quarterly dividends of 31 million or 125 million on an annual basis 

also in 2011 we made four quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share or 6 million on our series a preferred stock 

additionally during the second quarter of 2011 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 03 per common share or 12 on an annualized basis we made one quarterly dividend payments of 01 per share or 9 million and three quarterly dividend payments of 03 per share or 28 million on our common shares during 2011 

common shares outstanding 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key with 33873 holders of record of our common shares at december 31 2011 our book value per common share was 1009 based on 9530 million shares outstanding at december 31 2011 compared to 952 based on 8806 million shares outstanding at december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 our tangible book value per common share was 911 compared to 845 at december 31 2010

 at december 31 2011 we had 640 million treasury shares compared to 657 million treasury shares at december 31 2010 during 2011 shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

in the past we have periodically repurchased common shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors the program does not have an expiration date and we have outstanding board authority to repurchase 139 million shares we did not repurchase any common shares during all of 2011 or 2010 other that the shares acquired from employees in connection with our stock compensation plan as discussed in further detail in “supervision and regulation” in item 1 part i of this report we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the federal reserve setting forth capital actions including any share repurchases our board of directors and management may propose to make during the year pursuant to that requirement we have submitted our capital plan for review to the federal reserve that contemplates among other uses of our capital potential share repurchases in 2012 

2011 capital plan and proposed actions 

as part of its ongoing supervisory process the federal reserve requires a bhc to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile business strategies or corporate structure including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions on january 7 2011 we submitted our 20112012 comprehensive capital plan to the federal reserve on march 18 2011 the federal reserve informed us that it had no objection to our comprehensive capital plan following its comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” on june 10 2011 we submitted to the federal reserve 

  

and provided to the occ an updated comprehensive capital plan which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities on august 1 2011  the federal reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan 

capital adequacy 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31 2011 our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards expected to be promulgated under the doddfrank act or due to basel iii our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1116 at december 31 2011 compared to 1210 at december 31 2010 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 988 at december 31 2011 compared to 819 at december 31 2010 

banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries riskbased capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “riskweighted assets” riskweighted assets consist of total assets plus certain offbalance sheet and market items subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors currently banks and bank holding companies must maintain at a minimum tier 1 capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 400 and total capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 800 we expect us regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines in 2012 responding to both the dodd frank act and basel iii capital directives as of december 31 2011 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio and our total riskbased capital ratios were 1299 and 1651 respectively compared to 1516 and 1912 respectively at december 31 2010 

another indicator of capital adequacy the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskadjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 300 all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 400 as of december 31 2011 our leverage ratio was 1179 compared to 1302 at december 31 2010 

the enactment of the doddfrank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible tier 1 riskbased capital this three year phaseout period which commences january 1 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts “capital securities” being treated only as tier 2 capital these changes in effect apply the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs savings and loan holding companies and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important 

as of december 31 2011 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were 1299 1179 and 1651 respectively the capital securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute 12 billion or 136 123 and 136 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio respectively as of december 31 2011 

federal bank regulators group fdicinsured depository institutions into five categories ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” a “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 600 for tier 1 riskbased capital 500 for tier 1 leverage capital and 1000 for total riskbased capital and must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure if these provisions applied to bank holding companies we would qualify as “well capitalized” at december 31 2011 we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change analysis on a pro forma basis accounting for the phaseout of our capital securities as tier 1 eligible and therefore as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2011 also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines with the pro forma tier 1 riskbased capital ratio pro forma leverage ratio and pro forma total riskbased capital ratio being 

  

1164 1056 and 1651 respectively the current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or keybank a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in item 1 in the “supervision and regulation” section 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations as a result of the financial crisis the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies including keycorp the capital modifications mandated by the doddfrank act and set forth in basel iii which the federal reserve intends to implement in the near term are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks bhcs and covered nonbank financial companies which resulted from the financial crisis and therefore tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 4 in the “highlights of our performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to tier 1 common equity the corresponding nongaap measure our tier 1 common equity ratio was 1126 at december 31 2011 compared to 934 at december 31 2010 

at december 31 2011 we had a consolidated federal net deferred tax asset of 60 million and a state deferred tax liability of 24 million compared to combined net federal and state deferred tax assets of 442 million at december 31 2010 prior to the third quarter of 2009 we had been in a net deferred tax liability position generally for riskbased capital purposes deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarterend date based on its projected future taxable income for the year or ii 10 of the amount of an institution’s tier 1 capital based on these restrictions at december 31 2011 we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier 1 capital and riskweighted assets compared to 158 million at december 31 2010 we anticipate that we will not have a net deferred tax asset disallowed for riskbased capital purposes as we believe we will be in a net deferred tax liability position in the coming quarters 

basel iii 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” basel iii is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector and introduces for the first time an official definition and guideline for tier 1 common equity 

beginning on january 1 2013 banks with regulators adopting the basel iii capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios – 35 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 45 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 80 total capital to riskweighted assets the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at 0625 and be phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 when the requirements for the fully phasedin capital conservation buffer are included the resulting minimum levels for tier 1 capital and total riskbased capital will be higher than the us’s current “wellcapitalized” minimums a more thorough discussion of basel iii is included in item 1 “supervision and regulation” section of this report including a discussion of the fully phasedin requirements at january 1 2019 

given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when us capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized while we also have a strong liquidity position the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives including adding additional liquid assets issuing term debt and modifying our product pricing for loans commitments and deposits us regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the basel iii liquidity framework accordingly at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the basel iii liquidity framework accordingly a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the us implementation of the basel iii liquidity framework is expected in the first half of 2012

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

variable interest entities 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

  

  

 in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and in note 11 “variable interest entities” 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2011 is presented in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

  

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 16 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

figure 30 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2011 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

figure 30 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

  

 guarantees 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as 

  

underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 16 under the heading “guarantees” 

risk management 

overview 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit liquidity market compliance operational strategic and reputation risks we must properly and effectively identify assess measure monitor control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

our erm committee which consists of the chief executive officer and other senior executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the risk management committee of our board of directors annually the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

our board of directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprisewide risks in a manner that is effective balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging to assist in these efforts the board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the audit committee and the risk management committee 

the audit committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit financial reporting compliance risk and legal matters the implementation management and evaluation of operational risk and controls information security and fraud risk the audit committee also is responsible for evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance 

the risk management committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk market risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk including the actions taken to mitigate these risks as well as reputational and strategic risks the risk management committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital reviews the erm reports and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 

the audit and risk management committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and comport with regulatory expectations 

  

market risk management 

the cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline if market interest rates increase while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to “market risk” when the cash flows or value of the instrument is tied to such external factors most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk management 

interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and within policy limits established by the erm committee 

interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk 

 

  

  

  

 net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments including a most likely macro economic scenario simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 

typically the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over 

  

the next twelve months and term rates were to move in a similar fashion in light of the low interest rate environment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including a sustained flat yield curve an inverted slope yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance shifts investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 

figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2011 and 2010 at december 31 2011 our simulated exposure to a change in shortterm interest rates was moderately asset sensitive alco policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 as shown in figure 31 we are operating within these limits 

figure 31 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 as interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time we have gradually shifted from a liabilitysensitive position to an assetsensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances as the federal reserve’s fomc has indicated that it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014 we continue to invest available funds and execute hedges to moderate further increases in the assetsensitive position these activities will continue to recognize the shift in the mix and maturity of customer deposits our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of 

  

loan and deposit flows as changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile 

the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure 31 net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelvemonth horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 

economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve twentyfour and thirtysix month horizons eve measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths under the current level of market interest rates the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines 

management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

figure 32 portfolio swaps by interest rate risk management strategy 

 

  

   

derivatives not designated in hedge relationships 

our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in note 8 we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio using two years of historical information the model estimates the maximum potential oneday loss with a 95 confidence level statistically this means that losses will exceed var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter 

we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by the market risk committee which was established as part of our erm program at december 31 2011 the aggregate oneday trading limit set by the committee was 55 million we are operating within these constraints during 2011 our aggregate daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 17 million 12 million and 2 million respectively in 2010 our aggregate daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 18 million 12 million and 25 million respectively 

in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis we monitor loss limits use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests we report our market risk exposure to the risk management committee of the board of directors 

liquidity risk management 

we define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

governance structure 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 

oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the risk management committee of the keycorp board of directors the keybank board of directors the erm committee and the alco these groups regularly review various liquidity reports including liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive we communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues in addition we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds 

factors affecting liquidity 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

  

during the first quarter of 2011 moody’s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution which meets moody’s minimum ratings threshold as a result of this decision by moody’s on march 7 2011 keybank transferred approximately 15 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptablyrated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets keybank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits 

managing liquidity risk 

we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

at december 31 2011 we have no secured borrowings outstanding however we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer term strategy the liquid asset portfolio at december 31 2011 totaled 112 billion consisting of 64 billion of unpledged securities 19 billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and 29 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate over time due to excess liquidity heightened risk or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december 31 2011 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 123 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 45 billion at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 

longterm liquidity strategy 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however wholesale funds may be used to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives key’s clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is 90100 at december 31 2011 our loantodeposit ratio was 87 which we calculate as total loans loans heldforsale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of funding include customer deposits wholesale funding liquid assets and capital if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on 

  

wholesale funding or liquid assets conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets we actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources including short and longterm debt and secured borrowings 

liquidity programs 

we have several liquidity programs which are described in note 15 “longterm debt” that enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

liquidity for keycorp 

the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions and occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

our primary tools for assessing parent company liquidity is the net shortterm cash position which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets and a cash coverage metric which measures the ability to meet all projected obligations over 12 months another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons we generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods at december 31 2011 the parent company held 21 billion in shortterm investments which we project to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies 

typically the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2011 keybank paid 300 million in dividends to the parent and nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent 33 million in cash dividends and 12 million in noncash dividends during 2011 the parent did not make any capital infusions to keybank compared to 100 million during 2010 based upon existing regulatory guidance keybank has capacity to pay 13 billion in dividends to keycorp at january 1 2012 

during the first quarter of 2011 the parent company completed a 625 million equity offering at a price of 885 per common share in conjunction with the equity offering the parent company issued 1 billion 51 senior mediumterm notes series i during the first quarter of 2011 the proceeds from the sale of common shares and mediumterm notes were used along with other available funds to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of 31 million and discount amortization noncash of 4 million or 140 million on an annual basis related to these preferred shares 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has decreased as a result of capital securities redemptions and net customer loan and deposit flows however the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through a liquidity event liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals 

  

from time to time keycorp or its principal subsidiary keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities during 2011 we used the proceeds from our debt and common share offerings to repurchase our series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury as part of the tarp cpp and to pay dividends as previously noted the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of 31 million and discount amortization noncash of 4 million or 140 million on an annual basis related to these preferred shares 

we have approximately 183 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31 2011 as we consider alternative longterm strategic and liquidity plans opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately 30 million in taxes to be paid if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately 51 million accordingly we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31 2011 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings at december 31 2011 are shown in figure 33 we believe that these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of 2007 and 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 moody’s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities announced a one notch downgrade of keybanks’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt as a result of this decision by moody’s on march 7 2011 keybank transferred approximately 15 billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptablyrated institution resulting in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets for more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances and the related mortgage servicing assets see note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” more recently on december 6 2011 standard  poor’s announced a ratings review of 31 north american regional banks and their subsidiaries under its new bank ratings criteria announced november 9 2011 sp’s updated their ratings outlook on both keycorp and keybank from “stable” to “positive” and maintained the ratings for keycorp and keybank additional information on the liquidity risks presented to us in the event of a downgrade of our security ratings is included in item a risk factors

credit risk management 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 2 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20 of that amount as of december 31 2011 we had four client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these four individual net obligor commitments was 120 million at december 31 2011 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2011 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 986 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks at december 31 2011 the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was 360 million occasionally we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps these transactions with other lenders generated fee income 

  

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the trading income component of noninterest income 

we also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 34 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

figure 34 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

  

 watch and criticized assets 

watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 

criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead or have led to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources such as collateral liquidation criticized loan and lease outstandings showed improvement during 2011 decreasing 396 from one year ago 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

at december 31 2011 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1 billion or 203 of loans compared to 16 billion or 320 at december 31 2010 the allowance includes 51 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 388 million at december 31 2011 compared to 58 million that was allocated for impaired loans of 621 million one year ago for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2011 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 13810 of nonperforming loans compared to 15019 at december 31 2010 

we estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in credit policies or underwriting standards and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets for all commercial tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired commercial 

  

loans having an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full the allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31 2011 represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

as shown in figure 35 our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by 600 million or 37 during the past twelve months this contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio which has trended more favorably along with the decrease in loan levels over the past twelve months asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving we attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity more favorable conditions in the capital markets improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments decreased by 28 million to 45 million at december 31 2011 compared to the same period one year ago when combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses our total allowance for credit losses represented 212 of loans at the end of 2011 compared to 335 at the end of 2010 we expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during 2012 as a result of anticipated improvement in credit quality 

figure 35 allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

  

   

our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of 60 million for 2011 compared to a provision of 638 million for 2010 our net loan chargeoffs for 2011 exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by 601 million the decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances additionally we continue to work our exit loans and reduce exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net chargeoffs as these outstanding loan balances decrease so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision 

net loan chargeoffs 

net loan chargeoffs for 2011 totaled 541 million or 111 of average loans from continuing operations these results compare to net chargeoffs of 16 billion or 291 for the same period last year figure 36 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 37 

over the past twelve months net chargeoffs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by 912 million net chargeoffs for this line of business declined by 487 million from 2010 as shown in figure 39 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 115 million or 21 of total net loan chargeoffs for 2011 net chargeoffs in the exit loan portfolio decreased by 338 million from 2010 primarily driven by a decrease in net chargeoffs in the commercial loan portfolios

 nonperforming assets 

figure 38 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets these assets totaled 859 million at december 31 2011 and represented 173 of portfolio loans oreo and other nonperforming assets compared to 13 billion or 266 at december 31 2010 see note 1 under the headings “nonperforming loans” “impaired loans” and “allowance for loan and lease losses” for a summary of our nonaccrual and chargeoff policies

as shown in figure 38 nonperforming assets decreased during 2011 having declined for the past two years most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans nonperforming loans held for sale and oreo in the commercial real estate line of business as shown in figure 39 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 119 million or 14 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2011 compared to 210 million or 16 in 2010 

at december 31 2011 the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 62 of their original contractual amount owed total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 70 of their contractual amount owed and total nonperforming assets represented 65 of their original contractual amount owed at the same date oreo represented 41 of its original contractual amount owed while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 48 of their contractual amount owed 

at december 31 2011 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 237 million representing 33 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared to 306 million representing 29 respectively in the prior year 

figure 39 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2011 and 2010 the net chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of these loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 8 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2011 as compared to 11 at december 31 2010 additional information about loan sales is included in the “loans and loans held for sale” section under “loan sales”

 operational risk management 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 

operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards due to the passage of the doddfrank act large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities 

we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 

  

primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business our operational risk management function manages the operational risk management program which provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the operational risk committee a senior management committee oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committee’s oversight of these controls 

fourth quarter results 

our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in figure 44 highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2011 are summarized below 

earnings 

we had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 201 million or 21 per common share compared to a net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 292 million or 33 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2010 

the fourth quarter 2011 results were negatively impacted by a 24 million charge resulting from visa’s late fourth quarter announcement of a planned litigation escrow deposit in addition key recorded a 28 million gain on the sale of tuition management systems during the fourth quarter of 2010 fourth quarter 2011 net income attributable to key common shareholders was 194 million compared to net income attributable to key common shareholders of 279 million for the same quarter one year ago 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 101 compared to 153 for the fourth quarter of 2010 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 826 for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 1371 for the yearago quarter 

net interest income 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 563 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and the net interest margin was 313 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 635 million and a net interest margin of 331 for the fourth quarter of 2010 the decrease in net interest income is attributable to both a decline in earning assets and the net interest margin the net interest margin has been under pressure as a result of the continuation of the low rate environment contracting the spread between lending rates and funding costs 

noninterest income 

our noninterest income was 414 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 526 million for the yearago quarter investment banking and capital markets income decreased 39 million compared to the same period one year ago which includes a 24 million charge resulting from visa’s late fourth quarter announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit other income also decreased from the yearago quarter due to a 28 million gain from the sale of tuition management systems in the fourth quarter of 2010 also contributing to the decline in noninterest income were decreases in operating lease income of 17 million and net securities gains losses of 12 million electronic banking fees also declined 13 million as a result of new government pricing controls on debit transactions which were effective october 1 2011 

  

noninterest expense 

our noninterest expense was 717 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 744 million for the same period last year the improvement in expense levels resulted from declines of 20 million in fdic deposit insurance premiums 10 million in operating lease expense and reductions across several other expense categories these decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in employee benefits expense due to higher medical claims expense compared to the year ago quarter when key recorded a reduced amount due to favorable experience in addition the fourth quarter reflected a credit of 11 million in the provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments compared to a credit of 26 million in the same period one year ago 

provision for loan and lease losses 

our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of 22 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a credit of 97 million for the yearago quarter and a charge of 10 million for the third quarter of 2011 key’s allowance for loan and lease losses was 1 billion or 203 of total periodend loans at december 31 2011 compared to 235 at september 30 2011 and 320 at december 31 2010 

net loan chargeoffs for the quarter totaled 105 million or 86 of average loans these results compare to 256 million or 200 for the same period last year and 109 million or 90 for the previous quarter net loan chargeoffs have declined for the last eight consecutive quarters and were less than one percent of average loans for the second consecutive quarter 

income taxes 

for the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 69 million compared to a tax provision of 172 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 252 compared with 337 for the same quarter one year prior for the fourth quarter of 2011 the tax rate was lower due to lower pretax income and slightly higher tax credits earned during the period during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of 32 million as a result of our change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in nonus subsidiaries

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

as described below we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

for all commercial troubled debt restructurings regardless of size as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

  

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2011 would indicate the need for a 15 million increase in the level of the allowance the same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 35 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 15 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 9 million or 01 per share a 35 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 22 million or 02 per share 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

valuation methodologies 

we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our application of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

at december 31 2011 187 billion or 21 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2011 17 billion or 2 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

at december 31 2011 208 million or 2 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis approximately 9 of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 at december 31 2011 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses 

  

market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 709 million at december 31 2011 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2011 earnings by approximately 71 million 45 million after tax or 05 per share 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill due to the economic uncertainty experienced since 2007 we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill as necessary at december 31 2011 the key community bank reporting unit had 917 million in goodwill while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill 

as a result of our sale of tuition management systems in december 2010 customer relationship intangible assets of 15 million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during 2010 during 2009 we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of 241 million 192 million after tax or 28 per common share see note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 19 “employee benefits” 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2011 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

derivatives and hedging 

we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

  

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 16 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2011 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe that it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however if our assessments prove incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

during 2011 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates

acquisitions and divestitures 

 

the information presented in note 13 “acquisition divestiture and discontinued operations” is incorporated herein by reference 

 

competition 

 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures the financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions we compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards 

 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation continued during 2010 and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial institutions financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and the 

deposits and certain banking assets of the 157 banks that failed during 2010 representing 967 billion in total assets were redistributed through the fdic’s leastcost resolution process these factors have intensified the concentration of the industry over the last few years and placed increased competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services 

 

supervision and regulation 

 

the following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies financial holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the fdic and the banking system as a whole rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors we cannot necessarily predict changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies yet such changes may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

general 

 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” under the bhca pursuant to the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

 

our bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies we operate one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because domestic deposits in keybank are insured up to applicable limits and certain debt obligations of keybank and keycorp are temporarily guaranteed by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over keybank and keycorp under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” 

 

we also have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example our brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

capital actions dividend restrictions and the supervisory capital assessment program 

 

on november 14 2008 keycorp sold 25 billion of fixedrate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b the “series b preferred stock” and a warrant to purchase 35244361 common shares par value 100 the “warrant” to the us treasury in conjunction with its cpp the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock we will not be able to increase our dividends above the level paid in the third quarter of 2008 nor will we be permitted to repurchase any of its common shares or preferred stock without the approval of the us treasury subject to the availability of certain limited exceptions eg for purchases in connection with benefit plans 

 

the federal reserve advised in its supervisory letter sr 094 revised march 27 2009 that recipients of cpp funds should communicate reasonably in advance with federal reserve staff concerning how any proposed dividends capital redemptions and capital repurchases are consistent with the requirements of cpp and related federal reserve supervisory policy furthermore the federal reserve’s revised temporary addendum to sr 094 issued in november 2010 the “revised addendum” outlined its supervisory capital assessment program “scap” expectations and clarified that scap bank holding companies “bhcs” planned capital actions including plans to repay any outstanding us government investment in common or preferred shares requests to increase common stock dividends reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs or make other capital distributions would be evaluated as part of the supervisory assessment as with all of the nineteen scap bhcs should we seek to raise our common shares dividend following any repayment of the us treasury we must consult with the federal reserve and demonstrate that such actions are consistent with existing supervisory guidance 

 

federal banking law and regulations also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval historically dividends paid to us by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest on its debt the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and 

interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits our national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions during 2010 keybank did not pay any dividends to us nonbank subsidiaries paid us a total of 25 million in dividends during 2010 keybank could not pay dividends to us without prior regulatory approval because keybank’s net losses of 1151 billion for 2009 and 1161 billion for 2008 exceeded keybank’s net income during 2010 we made capital infusions of 100 million and 12 billion for 2010 and 2009 respectively into keybank in the form of cash at december 31 2010 we held 33 billion in shortterm investments which can be used to pay dividends service debt and finance corporate operations 

 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic for additional information on capital categories see the “regulatory capital standards and related matters —prompt corrective action” section below also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 

scap 

 

the federal reserve’s revised addendum related to the conduct of scap for 2011 requested that each scap bhc submit its comprehensive capital plan by january 7 2011 the comprehensive capital plan requirements include among other things 

 

  

pursuant to the doddfrank act the federal reserve is required beginning in 2012 to perform an annual supervisory assessment of certain covered bhcs and nonbanks and these same financial companies will be required to conduct semiannual stress tests currently we conduct stress testing on a quarterly basis the doddfrank act also requires the federal reserve to issue regulations concerning its supervisory assessment and stress testing by january 2012 which must 1 prescribe that three scenarios be used in the stress test—baseline adverse and severely adverse 2 establish the methodologies for the conduct of the test 3 establish the form and content of the report required to be submitted to the federal reserve and the financial institution’s primary regulator and 4 require companies to publish a summary of the required stress test these regulations have yet to be issued 

 

holding company structure 

 

bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital moreover if a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

 

source of strength doctrine under the doddfrank act and longstanding federal reserve policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when we may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of a bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law defines and prescribes minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalance sheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after certain deductions by riskweighted assets 

 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity including the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital limited amounts of term subordinated debt and mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses limited as a percentage of net riskweighted assets 

 

bank holding companies whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk 

 

on january 11 2011 the federal banking agencies published a proposal to revise their market risk capital rules the proposal would modify the scope of such rules to better capture positions for which the market risk capital rules are appropriate reduce procyclicality in market risk capital requirements enhance the rules’ sensitivity to risks that are not adequately captured under the current regulatory measurement methodologies and increase transparency through enhanced disclosures the proposal does not include the methodologies adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” for calculating the specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions because those methodologies relay on credit ratings which is impermissible under the doddfrank act consequently the proposal retains the current specific risk treatment for these positions until the agencies develop alternative standards of creditworthiness as required by the doddfrank act at december 31 2010 we had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased requirements including all required adjustments for market risk 

 

in addition to the riskbased standards bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 riskbased capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 at december 31 2010 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum leverage capital requirements and satisfied the scap requirements set forth in supervisory guidance 

 

our national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve on bank holding companies at december 31 2010 each of our national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve nor the occ has advised us or any of our national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratios applicable to us or such national bank subsidiary 

 

prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements under federal law such prompt corrective action includes imposing progressively more restrictions on operations management and capital distributions as an institution’s capital decreases fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well 

capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure at december 31 2010 keybank was well capitalized under the prompt corrective action standards federal law also requires that the bank regulatory agencies implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories with progressively more restrictions on operations management and capital distributions 

 

bank holding companies are not grouped into any of the five capital categories applicable to insured depository institutions if such categories applied to bank holding companies we believe that keycorp would satisfy the well capitalized criteria at december 31 2010 an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or parent bank holding company and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank holding company 

 

basel accords 

 

overview 

 

the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee in 2004 the basel committee published a new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying their activities 

 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline in december 2007 us federal banking regulators issued a final rule for basel ii implementation requiring banks with over 250 billion in consolidated total assets or onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion core banks to adopt the advanced approach of basel ii while allowing other institutions to elect to optin currently neither keycorp nor keybank is required to apply this final rule 

 

basel iii capital framework 

 

in december 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” basel iii is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector these measures aim to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress whatever the source improve risk management and governance and strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures basel iii requires higher and betterquality capital better risk coverage the introduction of an international leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress and the introduction of two global liquidity standards 

 

the basel iii final capital framework among other things 

 

 7 

 

  

the implementation of the basel iii final capital framework will commence january 1 2013 on that date banks with regulators adopting these standards in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios – 35 common equity tier 1 to riskweighted assets 45 tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and 80 total capital to riskweighted assets the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january 1 2016 at 0625 and be phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january 1 until it reaches 25 on january 1 2019 

 

the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from common equity tier 1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of common equity tier 1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of common equity tier 1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to common equity tier 1 will begin on january 1 2014 and will be phasedin over a fiveyear period 20 per year 

 

basel iii liquidity framework 

 

the basel iii final liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of liquidity risk exposure 

 

  

each of the components of these ratios is defined and the ratio calculated in accordance with detailed requirements in the basel iii liquidity framework although the basel committee has not asked for additional comment on these ratios both are subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements the basel iii liquidity framework provides specifically that revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio will be made by mid2013 with such ratios being introduced as a requirement on january 1 2015 revisions to the net stable funding ratio will be made by mid2016 and the net stable funding ratio will be introduced as a requirement on january 1 2018 

 

on january 13 2011 the basel committee issued its final “minimum requirements to ensure loss absorbency at the point nonviability” document it requires that all noncommon tier 1 and tier 2 instruments eg noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and subordinated debt issued by an internationally active bank must have a provision that such instruments at the option of the relevant regulator are to either be writtenoff or converted into common equity upon the occurrence of certain trigger events the final loss absorbency requirements specify that instruments issued on or after january 1 2013 must meet the new criteria to be included in regulatory capital instruments issued prior to january 1 2013 that do not meet the criteria but that meet all of the entry criteria for additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital will be considered as instruments that no longer qualify as additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital and will be phased out from january 1 2013 in accordance with the basel iii framework these provisions are similar to the concept set forth in the doddfrank act of phasing out of trust preferred securities cumulative preferred securities and certain other securities as tier 1 capital over a threeyear period beginning january 1 2013 as well as the application of similar capital standards to bhcs as are currently applied to depository institutions 

 

the us bank regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to basel iii however they have indicated informally that a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be released in mid2011 with final amendments to regulations becoming effective in mid2012 given our strong capital position we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework should us capital regulations corresponding to it be finalized while we also have a strong liquidity position the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives including adding additional liquid assets issuing term debt and modifying our product pricing for loans commitments and deposits us regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the basel iii liquidity framework accordingly at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the basel iii liquidity framework 

federal deposit insurance act 

 

deposit insurance coverage limits 

 

throughout 2010 the fdic standard maximum depositor insurance coverage limit was 250000 this limit which was made permanent by the doddfrank act applies per depositor per insured depository institution for each account ownership category also under the doddfrank act as amended by hr 6398 the fdic is required to provide temporary unlimited coverage for qualifying noninterestbearing transaction accounts including interest on lawyers trust accounts this temporary unlimited coverage is effective from december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 

 

deposit insurance assessments 

 

substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a riskbased assessment rate under the riskbased assessment system in effect during 2010 annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from 07 to 775 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category this system will remain in effect for the first quarter of 2011 in 2009 the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay on december 30 2009 their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 keybank’s assessment prepayment was 539 million for 2010 our fdic insurance assessment was 124 million as of december 31 2010 we had 388 million of prepaid fdic insurance assessment recorded on our balance sheet 

 

the doddfrank act requires the fdic to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and requires the dif reserve ratio to increase to 135 by september 30 2020 rather than 115 by december 31 2016 as previously required to implement these and other changes to the current deposit insurance assessment regime the fdic issued several proposed rules in 2010 on february 7 2011 the fdic adopted their final rule on assessments under the final rule which is effective on april 1 2011 keybank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its new assessment base depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating keybank’s regulatory rating ability to withstand asset and funding related stress and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure we estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be 60 to 90 million 

 

fico assessments 

 

all fdicinsured depository institutions have been required through assessments collected by the fdic to service the annual interest on certain 30year noncallable bonds issued by the financing corporation “fico” to fund losses incurred in the 1980s by the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation for 2010 the annualized fico assessment rate ranged from 0104 to 0106 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits 

 

temporary liquidity guarantee program 

 

in 2008 the fdic implemented its temporary liquidity guarantee program the “tlgp” the tlgp has two components a “debt guarantee program” temporarily guaranteeing the unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of qualifying newlyissued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities and a “transaction account guarantee” providing a temporary guarantee of depositor funds in qualifying noninterestbearing transaction accounts maintained at participating fdicinsured depository institutions for fdicguaranteed debt issued before april 1 2009 the debt guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or june 30 2012 for fdicguaranteed debt issued on or after april 1 2009 the debt guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or december 31 2012 the transaction account guarantee expired on december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 keycorp had 6875 million of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp and keybank had 10 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp keybank participated in the transaction account guarantee component of the tlgp during the first half of 2010 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions 

 

under the fdia an insured depository institution generally is liable to the fdic for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any commonly controlled insured institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled institution that is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

conservatorship and receivership of institutions 

 

if any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the fdic is appointed its conservator or receiver the fdic may under federal law disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by the other party to the contract against the receivership or conservatorship the amount paid upon such claim would depend upon among other factors the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and the priority of the claim relative to the priority of others in addition the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision regarding termination default acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution the fdic as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors 

 

depositor preference 

 

the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

 

regulatory reform developments 

 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed the doddfrank act into law the doddfrank act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies the doddfrank act implements numerous and farreaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies including banks and bank holding companies such as key for a review of the various reform measures being taken as a result of the doddfrank act we refer you to the risk factor on the doddfrank act on page 12 in item 1a risk factors 

 

the doddfrank act defers many of the details of its mandated reforms to future rulemakings by a variety of federal regulatory agencies for further detail on the doddfrank act see pub l 111203 hr 4173 for the full text of the act 

 

entry into certain covenants 

 

we entered into two transactions during 2006 and one transaction with an overallotment option in 2008 each of which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities “trust preferred securities” by delaware statutory trusts formed by us the “trusts” as further described below simultaneously with the closing of each of those transactions we entered into a socalled replacement capital covenant each a “replacement capital covenant” and collectively the “replacement capital covenants” for the benefit of persons that buy or hold specified series of longterm indebtedness of keycorp or its then largest depository institution keybank the “covered debt” each of the replacement capital covenants provide that neither keycorp nor any of its subsidiaries including any of the trusts will redeem or purchase all or any part of the trust preferred securities or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by keycorp and held by the trust the “junior subordinated debentures” as applicable on or before the date specified in the applicable replacement capital covenant with certain limited exceptions except to the extent that during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or purchase we have received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that i have equitylike characteristics that are the same as or more equitylike than the applicable characteristics of the trust preferred securities or the junior subordinated debentures as applicable at the time of redemption or purchase and ii we have obtained the prior approval of the federal reserve if such approval is then required by the federal reserve we will provide a copy of the replacement capital covenants to holders of covered debt upon request made in writing to keycorp investor relations 127 public square mail code oh01271113 cleveland oh 441141306

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

an investment in our common shares or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business ownership of our securities and our industry described below are certain risks and uncertainties the occurrence of which could have a material and adverse effect on us before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations andor access to liquidity andor credit could be materially and adversely affected “material adverse effect on us” if this were to happen the value of our securities — common shares series a preferred stock series b preferred stock trust preferred securities and debt securities — could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

 

risks related to our business 

 

our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 

 

on november 1 2010 moody’s announced a ratings downgrade for ten large us regional banks including keybank previously identified as benefiting from systemic support ratings for keybank’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt were downgraded one notch—from p1 to p2 a2 to a3 and a3 to baa1 respectively in conjunction with the ratings changes moody’s updated their ratings outlook on these ratings from “negative” to “stable” the new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by moody’s in connection with the securitizations that we service and impact the ability of keybank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by us and rated by moody’s these escrow deposit balances range from 150 to 185 billion since the downgrade keybank has been in discussions with moody’s regarding an alternative investment vehicle for these funds that would be acceptable to moody’s and maintain the funds at keybank subsequent to moody’s announcement that was issued on january 19 2011 moody’s indicated to keybank that these escrow deposit balances associated with our mortgage servicing operations will need to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011 as a result of this decision by moody’s keybank has determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets keybank expects to have ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position nevertheless the ratings downgrade could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us 

our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of which are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry the financial markets and the economy there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings 

 

if the securities of keycorp andor keybank suffer additional ratings downgrades such downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us thereby reducing our ability to generate income further downgrades of the credit ratings of securities particularly if they are below investmentgrade could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the federal reserve has acknowledged the possibility of further recession and deflation should this occur the financial services industry and our business could be adversely affected 

 

despite the conclusion of the recession the recovery of the us economy continues to progress slowly consumer confidence remains low unemployment remains high at 94 for december 2010 and the housing market remains an important downside risk with prices expected to fall through much of this year given the concerns about the us economy us employers continue to approach hiring with caution and as a result unemployment may rise furthermore the federal open market committee communicated in its december 2010 statement that measures of underlying inflation have continued to trend downward monetary and fiscal policy measures including the recent legislation formalizing the tax compromise between us congress and senate members the “tax compromise” aimed at lowering the risk of a doubledip recession may be insufficient to strengthen the recovery return unemployment to lower levels and restore stability to the financial markets furthermore federal reserve chairman bernanke and various governments in europe have acknowledged the need to commence a shift from fiscal stimulus efforts to fiscal constraint to reduce government deficits the recent tax compromise indicates that the shift in us fiscal policy will be postponed but only temporarily a coordinated shift from fiscal stimulus to fiscal reductions could hinder the return of a robust global economy and cause instability in the financial markets various governments in europe have announced budget reductions andor austerity measures as a means to limit fiscal budget deficits as a result of the economic crisis additionally many state and local governments in the us have also implemented budget reductions these factors could weaken the us economic recovery a weak us economic recovery could have a material adverse effect on us should economic indicators not improve the us could face a further recession and deflation such economic conditions could affect us in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways as well as affect our borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the failure of the european union to stabilize its weaker member economies such as greece portugal spain hungary ireland and italy could have international implications affecting the stability of global financial markets and hindering the us economic recovery 

 

on the eve of may 10 2010 greece was facing imminent default on its obligations on may 10 2010 finance ministers from the european union announced a deal to provide 560 billion in new loans and 76 billion under an existing lending program to countries facing instability the international monetary fund joined forces and announced that it was prepared to give 321 billion separately the european central bank also announced that it would buy government and corporate debt and the world’s leading central banks including the federal reserve bank of canada bank of england bank of japan and swiss national bank announced a joint intervention to make more dollars available for interbank lending these and other monetary and fiscal policy efforts appear to have stabilized the european union’s weaker member economies nevertheless should these monetary and fiscal policy measures be insufficient to restore stability to the financial markets the recovery of the us economy could be hindered or reversed which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the doddfrank act subjects us to a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements because the doddfrank act imposes more stringent regulatory requirements on the largest financial institutions key could be competitively disadvantaged 

 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed the doddfrank act into law the doddfrank act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies although many provisions remain subject to further rulemaking the doddfrank act implements numerous and farreaching changes across the 

financial landscape affecting financial companies including bank and bankholding companies such as key by among other things

the doddfrank act defers many of the details of its mandated reforms to future rulemakings by a variety of federal regulatory agencies while we cannot predict the effect of these various rulemakings which have yet to be issued we do anticipate a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements regulatory reform will likely place additional costs on larger financial institutions may impede growth opportunities and may place larger financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage in the market place additionally reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that we deal with in the course of our business such as rating agencies insurance companies and investors heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations resulting from the doddfrank act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the doddfrank act provides for the phaseout beginning january 1 2013 of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier 1 riskbased capital for purposes of the regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies 

 

currently our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities represent 15 of our tier 1 riskbased capital or 18 billion of our 118 billion of tier 1 riskbased capital by comparison the us treasury’s cpp investment noncumulative perpetual preferred securities and our common equity represent 21 2 and 62 respectively of our tier 1 riskbased capital as of december 31 2010 the anticipated phaseout as eligible tier 1 riskbased capital of our trust preferred securities and enhanced trust preferred securities will eventually result in us having less of a capital buffer above the current wellcapitalized regulatory standard of 6 of tier 1 riskbased capital accordingly we may eventually determine it is advisable or our regulators could require us based upon new capital or liquidity regulations or otherwise to raise additional tier 1 riskbased capital through the issuance of additional preferred stock or common equity should such issuances occur they would likely result in dilution to our shareholders currently we expect to have sufficient access to the capital markets to be able to raise any necessary replacement capital nevertheless should market conditions deteriorate our ability to raise capital may be diminished significantly which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us approximately 140 billion of trust preferred securities issued by us financial institutions will be affected by the doddfrank act phaseout of trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible many other institutions are faced with this same issue furthermore the doddfrank act and related or other rulemaking may result in new regulatory capital standards for institutions to be recognized as wellcapitalized these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

an offering of a significant amount of additional common shares or equity convertible into our common shares could cause us to issue a significant amount of common shares to a private investor or group of private investors and thus have a significant investor with voting rights 

 

any issuance or issuances totaling a significant amount of our common shares or equity convertible into our common shares could cause us to issue a significant amount of common shares to a private investor or group of investors and thus have a significant investor with voting rights having a significant shareholder may make some future transactions more difficult or perhaps impossible to complete without the support of such shareholder the interests of the significant shareholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders there can be no assurance that any significant shareholder will exercise its influence in our best interests as opposed to its best interests as a significant shareholder accordingly a significant shareholder may make it difficult to approve certain transactions even if they are supported by the other shareholders these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

we are subject to market risks including in the commercial real estate sector should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector remain weak under continuing pressure by reduced asset values high vacancies and reduced rents commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of 2007 after gaining approximately 30 since 2005 and 90 since 2001 according to moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property index december 2010 commercial real estate values were down 42 from their peak many of our commercial real estate loans were originated between 2005 and 2007 a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans these properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments weak economic conditions typically slow the execution of new leases such conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover as we experienced during 2010 vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space are expected to remain elevated and could increase in 2011 increased vacancies could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters the combination of these factors could result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market should these fundamentals continue to deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income it could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

 

during the recent recession in december 2007 to june 2009 the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets have experienced reached extreme levels the severe market dislocations in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable for example a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to credit risk in the form of changes in interest rates andor changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate which changes could adversely affect us 

 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor further weakening of economic conditions caused by a doubledip recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 

 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 69 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so however our loan portfolio still contains a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances 

 

we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmentalrelated covenants which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law we take steps to mitigate risks however should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants our credit quality could be adversely affected the deterioration of one or more of any of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

there can be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government to restore liquidity and stability to the us financial system and reform financial regulation in the us will help stabilize the us financial system 

 

since 2008 the federal government has intervened in an unprecedented manner in response to the recent financial crisis that affected the banking system and financial markets the eesa was enacted and signed into law by president bush in october 2008 in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions under the authority provided by eesa the us treasury established the cpp and the core provisions of the financial stability plan aimed at stabilizing and providing liquidity to the financial markets there 

can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the eesa the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “recovery bill” the doddfrank act the tax compromise or other programs and initiatives undertaken by the us government will have on the financial markets in addition the federal reserve has implemented a variety of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy nevertheless the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability experienced in late 2008 and through the third quarter of 2009 may return or persist during the liquidity crisis from late 2007 to 2009 regional financial institutions faced difficulties issuing debt in the fixed income debt markets these conditions could return and pose continued difficulties for the issuance of both medium term note and longterm subordinated note issuances the failure of the us government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the us economy on a stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening of current financial market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on us in the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets return or become exacerbated there may be a material adverse effect on us from 1 continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets 2 continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically 3 limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system or 4 recessionary conditions that return are deeper or last longer than currently anticipated 

 

issuing a significant amount of common equity to a private investor may result in a change in control of keycorp under regulatory standards and contractual terms 

 

should we obtain a significant amount of additional capital from any individual private investor a change of control could occur under applicable regulatory standards and contractual terms such change of control may trigger notice approval andor other regulatory requirements in many states and jurisdictions in which we operate we are a party to various contracts and other agreements that may require us to obtain consents from our respective contract counterparties in the event of a change in control the failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals or contractual consents due to a change in control may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

should we decide to repurchase the us treasury’s series b preferred stock future issuances of common shares may be necessary which if necessary may result in significant dilution to holders of keycorp common shares 

 

in conjunction with any repurchase of the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury we may elect or be required by our regulators to increase the amount of our tier 1 common equity through the sale of additional common shares in addition in connection with the us treasury’s purchase of the series b preferred stock pursuant to a letter agreement dated november 14 2008 and the securities purchase agreement — standard terms the us treasury received a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an initial per share exercise price of 1064 subject to adjustment which expires ten years from the issuance date and we have agreed to provide the us treasury with registration rights covering the warrant and the underlying common shares the terms of the warrant provide for a procedure upon repurchase of the series b preferred stock to determine the value of the warrant and purchase the warrant within approximately 40 days of the repurchase of the series b preferred stock however even if we were to redeem the series b preferred stock there is no assurance that this warrant will be fully retired and therefore that it will not be exercised prior to its expiration date the issuance of additional common shares as a result of the exercise of the warrant the us treasury holds would likely dilute the ownership interest of keycorp’s existing common shareholders 

 

the terms of the warrant provide that if we issue common shares or securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable for common shares at a price that is less than 90 of the market price of such shares on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement to sell such shares the number and the per share price of common shares to be purchased pursuant to the warrant will be adjusted pursuant to its terms we may also choose to issue securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares and such securities may themselves contain antidilution provisions such antidilution adjustment provisions may have a further dilutive effect on other holders of our common shares 

 

there can be no assurance that we will not in the future determine that it is advisable or that we will not encounter circumstances where we determine that it is necessary to issue additional common shares securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or commonequivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital nevertheless there can be no assurance that our regulators including the us treasury and the federal reserve will not conduct additional “stress test” capital assessments outside of typical examination cycles such as the scap andor require us to generate additional capital including tier 1 common equity in the future in the event of further negative economic circumstances in order for us to redeem our series b preferred stock held by the us treasury under the cpp or otherwise the market price of our common shares could decline as a result of such exchange offerings as well as other sales of a large block of our common shares or similar securities in the market thereafter or the perception that such sales could occur these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

we may not be permitted to repurchase the us treasury’s cpp investment if and when we request approval to do so 

 

while it is our plan to repurchase the series b preferred stock as soon as practicable in order to repurchase such securities in whole or in part we must establish to our regulators’ satisfaction that we have met all of the conditions to repurchase and must obtain the approval of the federal reserve and the us treasury there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase the us treasury’s cpp investment in our series b preferred stock subject to conditions that we find acceptable or at all in addition to limiting our ability to return capital to our shareholders the us treasury’s investment could limit our ability to retain key executives and other key employees and limit our ability to develop business opportunities these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our earnings on loans and other interestearning assets 

 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings we use simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet changes customer behavior new products new business volume product pricing competitor behavior the behavior of market interest rates and anticipated hedging activities simulation analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future risks and trends accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes actual hedging strategies employed changes in balance sheet composition and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events 

 

although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to changes in the financial markets which could adversely affect us 

 

traditionally market factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates changes in the equity markets and changes in the financial soundness of bond insurers sureties and other unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect current market values of financial instruments during 2008 market events demonstrated this to an extreme between july 2007 and october 2009 conditions in the fixed income markets specifically the wider credit spreads over benchmark us treasury securities for many fixed income securities caused significant volatility in the market values of loans securities and certain other financial instruments that are held in our trading or heldforsale portfolios opportunities to minimize the adverse affects of market changes are not always available substantial changes in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services to institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients during 2008 key incurred 54 million of derivativerelated charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of lehman brothers another example of losses related to this type of risk are the losses associated with the bernie madoff ponzi scheme “madoff ponzi scheme” as a result of the madoff ponzi scheme our investment subsidiary austin determined that its funds had suffered investment losses up to 186 million following lehman brothers’ failure we took several steps to better measure monitor and mitigate our counterparty risks and to reduce these exposures and implemented our enterprise risk management program to better monitor and evaluate risk presented enterprisewide these measures include daily position measurement and reporting the use of scenario analysis and stress testing replacement cost estimation risk mitigation strategies and market feedback validation 

many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us it is not possible to anticipate all of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks completely accordingly there is no assurance that our enterprise risk management program will effectively mitigate these risks accordingly these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels 

 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2009 credit markets have improved since then and we have significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth exiting certain noncore lending businesses diversifying our funding base maintaining a liquid asset portfolio and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity many of these disrupted markets are showing signs of recovery nonetheless if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time should our funding needs necessitate it we may need to expand the utilization of unsecured wholesale funding instruments or use other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets — domestic european and canadian — as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available under certain stressed conditions experienced in the liquidity crisis during 20072009 some of these alternative means of funding were not available should these forms of funding become unavailable it is unclear what impact given current economic conditions unavailability of such funding would have on us a deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 

 

we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks incurred in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses ie if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses should they become necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to operational risk 

 

we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a 

system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located — the northwest the rocky mountains the great lakes and the northeast — as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets outside of our footprint real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions certain markets such as florida southern california phoenix arizona and las vegas nevada have experienced more significant deterioration the delinquencies nonperforming loans and chargeoffs that we have experienced since 2007 have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession an act of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real estate could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in recent years while the breadth of the institutions that we compete with has increased competition has intensified as a result of consolidation efforts during 2009 competition continued to intensify as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to further redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to strong and large financial institutions we expect this trend to continue the competitive landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies during the liquidity crisis due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity the financial services industry’s competitive landscape could become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 

  

failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things keycorp as well as other financial institutions more generally have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns including with respect to stress testing capital levels asset quality provisioning and other prudential matters arising as a result of the recent financial crisis and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises 

 

congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes the passage of the doddfrank act has made it clear that a variety of significant changes to the banking and financial institutions’ 

regulatory regime will be implemented over the next few years it is not possible to predict the scope of such changes or their potential impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

these regulations or others designed to implement parts of comprehensive financial regulatory reform could limit our ability to conduct certain of our businesses such as funds that are managed by our investment advisor subsidiary victory capital management inc or funds sponsored and advised by our principal investing line of business which could require us to divest or spinoff certain of our business units and private equity investments furthermore as part of the scap key was identified as a financial institution that was one of nineteen firms that collectively hold twothirds of the banking assets and more than onehalf of the loans in the us banking system while it is difficult to predict the extent or nature of regulatory reform should regulatory reform limit the size of the scap banks our ability to pursue opportunities to achieve growth through the acquisition of other banks or deposits could be affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on us such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank our largest subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to us during 2008 and 2009 keybank did not pay any dividends to us nonbank subsidiaries paid us 25 million in dividends during 2010 during 2010 keybank could not pay dividends to keycorp because keybank’s net losses of 1151 billion for 2009 and 1161 billion for 2008 exceeded keybank’s net income during 2010 for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation — capital actions dividend restrictions and the supervisory capital assessment program” of this report 

 

also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our earnings andor financial condition may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws or the interpretation of them 

 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on us although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

 

like all businesses we are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred tax assets the carrying value of these assets is dependent upon earnings forecasts and prior period earnings among other things a significant change in our assumptions could affect the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 

  

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want andor need in order to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position our performance including our competitive position could suffer and in turn have a material adverse effect on us although we have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse effect on us because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel for our talented executives andor relationship managers 

 

pursuant to the standardized terms of the cpp among other things we agreed to institute certain restrictions on the compensation of certain senior executive management positions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified senior executives other restrictions were imposed under the recovery act the doddfrank act and other legislation or regulations our ability to attract andor retain talented executives andor relationship managers may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if any does occur that it will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we continually encounter technological change 

 

the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in 

marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

 

from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal actions against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment of the claims whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any reputation damage from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

risks associated with our common shares 

 

our issuance of securities to the us treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares if we are unable to redeem such preferred shares the dividend rate will increase substantially after five years 

 

in connection with our sale of 25 billion of the series b preferred stock to the us treasury in conjunction with its cpp we also issued a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an exercise price of 1064 the number of shares was determined based upon the requirements of the cpp and was calculated based on the average market price of our common shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval of our issuance which was also the basis for the exercise price of 1064 the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock we will not be able to increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend declared during the third quarter 2008 01875 per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our common shares or preferred stock without among other things us treasury approval or the availability of certain limited exceptions eg purchases in connection with our benefit plans furthermore as long as the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions these restrictions combined with the dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and as a result could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

unless we are able to redeem the series b preferred stock during the first five years the dividend payments on this capital will increase substantially at that point from 5 125 million annually to 9 225 million annually depending on market conditions at the time this increase in dividends could significantly impact our liquidity and as a result have a material adverse effect on us 

 

you may not receive dividends on the common shares 

 

holders of our common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments furthermore our common shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding as of february 17 2011 there were 2904839 shares of keycorp’s series a preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 100 per share issued and 

outstanding and 25000 shares of the series b preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 100000 per share issued and outstanding 

 

in july 2009 we reduced the quarterly dividend on our common shares to 001 per share as long as our series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock are outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions in addition prior to november 14 2011 unless we have redeemed all of the series b preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of the series b preferred stock to third parties the consent of the us treasury will be required for us to among other things increase our common shares dividend above 1875 except in limited circumstances should we redeem the us treasury’s investment our ability to increase our dividend these factors could adversely affect the market price of our common shares also keycorp is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends 

 

in addition terms of keybank’s outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on keycorp’s capital stock including its common shares or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture if we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

there may be future sales or other dilution of our equity which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

we are not restricted from issuing additional common shares including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common shares as described above in connection with our sale of 25 billion of series b preferred stock to the us treasury we issued to the department of the treasury a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an exercise price of 1064 subject to adjustment although we have the right to repurchase the warrant at a negotiated price we may not desire or be able to do so and if we do not repurchase the warrant the us treasury could either exercise the warrant or sell it to third parties the issuance of additional common shares as a result of exercise of this warrant or the issuance of convertible securities would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common shares in addition we have in the past and may in the future issue options convertible preferred stock andor other securities that may have a dilutive effect on our common shares the market price of our common shares could decline as a result of any such offering other capital raising strategies or other sales of a large block of shares of our common shares or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 

 

our common shares are equity and are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other noncommon equity claims against our subsidiaries 

 

our common shares are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness as such our common shares will rank junior to all of our current and future indebtedness and to other nonequity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us including in the event of our liquidation additionally holders of our common shares are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the holders of our common shares in addition our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary’s liquidation or otherwise and thus the ability of a holder of our common shares to benefit indirectly from such distribution will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized as a result our common shares will effectively be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries as of december 31 2010 we had 138 billion of borrowed funds and 606 billion of deposits and the aggregate liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock was 27 billion 

 

our share price can be volatile 

 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common shares when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

 23 

  

general market fluctuations market disruption industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

 

our common shares are not a bank deposit and therefore are not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

risks associated with our industry 

 

maintaining or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices for our products and services 

 

the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences there is increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace with evolving preferences of consumers and businesses payment methods and financial service providers have evolved as the advancement of technology has made possible the delivery of financial products and services through different mediums and providers such as cell phones and paypal accounts thereby increasing competitive pressure in the delivery of financial products and services the adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify our existing products and services furthermore we might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval or sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base the introduction of new products and services has the potential to introduce risk which in turn can present challenges to us in operating within our risk tolerances while also achieving growth in our market share in addition there is increasing pressure from our competitors to deliver products and services at lower prices these factors could reduce our revenues from our net interest margin and feebased products and services and have a material adverse effect on us 

 

certain industries including the financial services industry are more significantly affected by certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values should the improvement of these economic factors lag the improvement of the overall economy or not occur we could be adversely affected 

 

should the stabilization of the us economy lead to a general economic recovery the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall economy or not occur at all these economic factors typically affect certain industries such as real estate and financial services more significantly for example improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months our clients include entities active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on 

loans should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time it could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry business and results of operations 

 

the dramatic deterioration experienced in the housing market since 2007 led to weakness across geographies industries and ultimately the broad economy during this period the housing market experienced falling home prices increasing foreclosures unemployment and underemployment rose significantly and weakened commercial real estate fundamentals negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and commercial and investment banks the resulting writedowns to assets of financial institutions caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital to merge with larger and stronger institutions and in some cases to seek government assistance or bankruptcy protection it is not possible to predict if these economic conditions will reemerge which of our markets products or other businesses may ultimately be affected and whether our actions and government remediation efforts may effectively mitigate these factors if economic conditions deteriorate it could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

if economic conditions deteriorate we may face the following risks including but not limited to 

 

  

financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 

 

technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on us

strategic developments 

 

we initiated the following actions during 2010 and 2009 to support our corporate strategy 

 

  

economic overview 

 

the strength of the economic recovery in the united states varied throughout 2010 however the year ended with a positive tone during the first quarter gross domestic product “gdp” increased 37 the second biggest quarterly increase since the recession began in december of 2007 gdp growth continued into the second and third quarters although at a lower level the average quarterly gdp growth of 27 for the first three quarters of 2010 represents a significant improvement from the 2009 average quarterly change in gdp of 25 and also outpaces the tenyear average of 17 growth in 2010 was supported by businesses rebuilding inventory levels and capital spending on equipment and software growth was also sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending which grew at an average monthly rate of 3 for 2010 matching the rate of growth in 2009 

 

despite the strength in consumer spending employers remained reluctant to add a significant number of employees to payrolls us payrolls increased by 9 million during 2010 compared to a decline of 51 million in 2009 2010 was the first year of job growth since the recession began over 8 million americans lost their jobs during the recession the unemployment rate declined to 94 in december of 2010 compared to 99 in december of 2009 

housing continued to be a drag on consumer wealth in 2010 as home buying activity declined after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit offered as part of the the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 historically low mortgage rates were not enough to attract buyers sales of existing homes declined by 3 in 2010 compared to a 15 rise in 2009 the median price of existing homes in december 2010 declined 1 from december 2009 compared to a 3 annual decline a year earlier a reduced level of foreclosures helped to stabilize existing home prices the number of foreclosures in december 2010 declined 26 from the december 2009 level new home sales declined by 8 in 2010 compared to a 6 decline in 2009 the median price of new homes increased by 8 new home construction in december 2010 declined 8 from the same month in 2009 

 

due to an improved economic outlook and functioning of the financial markets the federal reserve ceased its purchases of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities and closed most of its emergency liquidity facilities during the first quarter of 2010 as the economic outlook moderated during the second and third quarters the federal reserve decided at the november federal open market committee meeting to reinstate quantitative easing through additional agency security purchases the federal reserve also held the federal funds target rate near zero throughout all of 2010 benchmark term interest rates declined during 2010 due to these federal reserve actions and expectations of a slow economic recovery during 2010 investors sought the safety of treasury securities at times of heightened fears related to the european sovereign debt crisis as a result of these factors the benchmark twoyear treasury yield decreased to 60 at december 31 2010 from 114 at december 31 2009 and the tenyear treasury yield decreased to 330 at december 31 2010 from 384 at december 31 2009 

 

regulatory reform developments 

 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed the doddfrank act into law this act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies the doddfrank act implements numerous and farreaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies including banks and bank holding companies such as key for a review of the various changes that the doddfrank act implements see the “supervision and regulation — regulatory reform” in item 1 business of this report many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed andor implemented 

 

interchange fees 

 

on december 16 2010 the federal reserve released proposed rules governing interchange fees that merchants pay to banks when consumers make purchases with their debit cards the “proposal” the proposal would implement provisions of the doddfrank act the proposal was open for public comment through february 22 2011 with the federal reserve expecting implementation of any proposed interchange fee standards by july 21 2011 should the proposal be adopted 

 

as previously announced we currently estimate that approximately 100 million in debit interchange revenue could be impacted by the proposal until the regulations are finalized by the federal reserve it is premature to assess the impact on this combined revenue stream of the proposal it is possible that the effect could be significant to the revenue we derive from these activities 

 

regulation e pursuant to the electronic fund transfer act of 1978 

 

during the third quarter of 2010 the federal reserve’s final rules regarding regulation e became effective regulation e is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers regulation e became effective july 1 2010 for new clients and on august 15 2010 for existing clients regulation e among other items prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client without receiving consent from the client to “optin” to the financial institutions overdraft services for atm and everyday debit card transactions 

 

based on the number of clients whom have optedin we estimate the impact to us was an annualized decline of approximately 40 million in our deposit service charge income during the fourth quarter of 2010 this decline is consistent with our previously reported expectations however this amount is subject to change as additional clients make their overdraft decisions 

 

fdic rulemaking developments 

 

several significant developments have impacted deposit insurance assessments substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a riskbased assessment rate under the riskbased assessment system in effect during 2010 annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from 07 to 775 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category this system will remain in effect for the first quarter of 2011 in 2009 the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay on december 30 2009 their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 

the amount of keybank’s assessment prepayment was 539 million for 2010 our fdic insurance assessment was 124 million as of december 31 2010 we had 388 million of prepaid fdic insurance assessment recorded on our balance sheet 

 

the doddfrank act requires the fdic to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and requires the dif reserve ratio to increase to 135 by september 30 2020 rather than 115 by december 31 2016 as previously required to implement these and other changes to the current deposit insurance assessment regime the fdic issued several proposed rules in 2010 on february 7 2011 the fdic adopted their final rule on assessments under the final rule which is effective on april 1 2011 keybank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its new assessment base depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating keybank’s regulatory rating ability to withstand asset and funding related stress and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure we estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be 60 to 90 million 

 

demographics 

 

we have two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank the effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business segments operate 

 

key community bank serves consumers and small to midsized businesses by offering a variety of deposit investment lending and wealth management products and services these products and services are provided through a 14state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions rocky mountains and northwest great lakes and northeast 

 

commercial and industrial loan growth in our middlemarket portfolio is improving we are particularly encouraged as we experienced commercial loan growth during the fourth quarter of 2010 in the northeast region trends are improving in the great lakes rocky mountains and northwest regions as the economic recovery migrates across the country merger and acquisition activity is also increasing and we expect businesses to begin to draw on their available credit facilities and cash to make investments in their production capabilities that have been postponed over the past several years 

 

figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of our key community bank segment’s average core deposits commercial loans and home equity loans 

 

figure 2 key community bank geographic diversity 

 

 

 

  

key corporate bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally within and beyond our 14state branch network as well as internationally 

 

the real estate capital and corporate banking services business consists of two business units real estate capital provides lending debt placements servicing and equity and investment banking services to developers brokers and owner investors dealing primarily with nonowneroccupied properties corporate banking provides a full array of commercial banking products and cash management services 

 

equipment finance meets the equipment leasing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients 

 

the institutional and capital markets business consists of two business units keybanc capital markets provides commercial lending treasury management investment banking derivatives foreign exchange equity and debt underwriting and trading and 

syndicated finance products and services to large corporations and middlemarket companies victory capital management manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios for a national client base 

 

additional information regarding the products and services offered by our key community bank and key corporate bank segments are described further in this report in note 21 “line of business” 

 

since the beginning of the financial crisis results for key corporate bank have been adversely affected by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets in 2010 credit losses in the key corporate bank declined and the overall recovery in the equity markets led to growth in the market values of assets under management and stability in the market value of other assets primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading 

 

we saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of 2010 we used this as an opportunity to continue to sell certain of our nonperforming assets we were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at prices that were close to their carrying value as recorded on our books 

 

figure 22 which appears later in this report in the “loans and loans held for sale” section shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location as previously reported we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and since december 31 2007 we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties portion of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by 3 billion or 85 to 525 million additional information about loan sales is included in the “credit risk management” section 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note 1 should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 

 

in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them 

 

we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions a brief discussion of each of these areas follows 

 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses for example we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions lending policies underwriting standards and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 

 

for all tdr’s regardless of size as well as all other impaired loans with an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate for example a specific allowance may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain that the loan will be repaid in full 

 

we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower however since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 

 

at december 31 2010 the key community bank reporting unit had 917 million in goodwill while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses for example class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment conversely the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile in either case historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management’s determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31 2010 would indicate the need for a 16 million increase in the level of the allowance the same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a 35 million increase in the allowance such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results following the above examples a 16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 10 million or 01 per share a 35 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately 22 million or 02 per share 

 

as we make decisions regarding the allowance we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes nonetheless if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note 1 under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” 

 

valuation methodologies 

 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements in the absence of quoted market prices we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models which are based on thirdparty data as well as our judgment assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant market available inputs we describe our adoption of this accounting guidance the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note 1 under the heading “fair value measurements” and in note 6 “fair value measurements” 

 

at december 31 2010 253 billion or 28 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2010 22 billion or 3 of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level 1 or level 2 

 

at december 31 2010 296 million or 03 of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis approximately 13 of these assets were classified as level 1 or level 2 at december 31 2010 there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

 

valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued to determine the values of assets and liabilities as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates asset returns prepayment rates and other factors the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities including loans held for sale principal investments goodwill and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

 

a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note 1 under the heading “loans held for sale” 

 

our principal investments include direct and indirect investments predominantly in privatelyheld companies the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors including the target company’s financial condition and results of operations values of public companies in comparable businesses market liquidity and the nature and duration of resale restrictions the fair value of principal investments was 898 million at december 31 2010 a 10 positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2010 earnings by approximately 90 million 56 million after tax or 06 per share 

 

the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading “goodwill and other intangible assets” the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach we perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable however if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 

 

the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value suggesting goodwill impairment in such a case we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit 

representing the unit’s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit’s net assets excluding goodwill any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

as a result of our sale of tuition management systems in december 2010 customer relationship intangible assets of 15 million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during 2010 during 2009 we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of 241 million 192 million after tax or 28 per common share see note 10 “goodwill and other intangible assets” for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges 

 

due to the economic uncertainty experienced since 2007 we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill as necessary 

 

the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions are presented in note 19 “employee benefits” 

 

when potential asset impairment is identified we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie temporary or otherthantemporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment for example unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity those deemed “otherthantemporary” are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity based on certain factors additional information regarding temporary and otherthantemporary impairment on securities available for sale at december 31 2010 is provided in note 7 “securities” 

 

derivatives and hedging 

 

we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship 

 

the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices however interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve in the future these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading “derivatives” and note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

 

contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes 

 

contingent liabilities arising from litigation and from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations are summarized in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note 16 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31 2010 

 

it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 

 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and in particular our projections for future taxable income we currently believe that it is morelikelythannot that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods however changes to the evidence used in our assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of 

operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note 12 “income taxes” 

 

during 2010 we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates 

 

highlights of our 2010 performance 

 

financial performance 

 

for 2010 we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 390 million or 47 per common share these results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 1629 billion or 227 per common share for 2009 

 

figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years our financial performance for each of the past six years is summarized in figure 4 

 

figure 3 results of operations 

 

 

 

  

the earnings improvement in 2010 resulted from improved preprovision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses when compared to 2009 results in 2009 were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses writeoffs of certain intangible assets and writedowns of certain commercial real estate related investments 

 

with three consecutive profitable quarters and continued signs of increased economic activity on the part of our clients we believe that we are positioned well to compete with other businesses in 2011 our core financial measures – strong capital enhanced liquidity adequate loan and lease loss reserves as well as our exit from riskier lending categories – represent a firm foundation for the year ahead 

 

net interest margin from continuing operations was 326 for 2010 this was an increase of 43 basis points from 2009 this increase was primarily due to lower funding costs which began in the latter part of 2009 we continue to experience an improvement in our mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts this benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay downs on loans during 2009 our net interest margin was under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels throughout the year this resulted in a larger decrease in interest rates on earning assets than that experienced on interestbearing liabilities 

we saw an increase in loan demand within our core commercial client base during the fourth quarter of 2010 excluding the impact of our exit portfolios our commercial and industrial and leasing portfolios both experienced loan growth for the first time since the fall of 2008 however there can be no assurance this will continue in 2011 as many clients have sufficient liquidity resources to meet current operating needs 

 

in 2010 credit quality also continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both key community bank and key corporate bank net loan chargeoffs and nonperforming loans declined each quarter during 2010 at december 31 2010 nonperforming assets stood at their lowest level since the third quarter of 2008 

 

net chargeoffs for 2010 were 16 billion a decrease of 687 million from 2009 during the same period commercial loan net chargeoffs decreased by 673 million primarily driven by lower chargeoffs from the commercial real estate construction portfolio 

 

at december 31 2010 our nonperforming loans totaled 11 billion and represented 213 of periodend portfolio loans compared to 372 at december 31 2009 nonperforming assets at december 31 2010 totaled 13 billion and represented 266 of portfolio loans oreo and other nonperforming assets compared to 25 billion and 425 at december 31 2009 most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in the commercial financial and agricultural the real estate – commercial mortgage and the real estate – construction portfolios 

 

our exit loan portfolio accounted for 210 million or 1570 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2010 compared to 599 million or 2386 at december 31 2009 

 

our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to 16 billion from 26 billion one year ago at december 31 2010 our allowance represented 320 of total loans and 15019 of nonperforming loans compared to 431 and 11587 respectively at december 31 2009 one of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio in addition we are continuing to work down the loan portfolios that have been identified for exit to improve our riskadjusted returns further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “credit risk management” 

 

at december 31 2010 our tier 1 common equity and tier 1 riskbased capital ratios were 934 and 1516 compared to 750 and 1275 respectively at december 31 2009 in 2009 we completed a series of successful transactions that generated approximately 24 billion of new tier i common equity to strengthen our overall capital 

 

additionally we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions during 2010 while in the midst of weak loan demand and a soft economy our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was 90 for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 97 for the fourth quarter of 2009 this improvement was accomplished by growing our noninterestbearing deposits now and money market deposits reducing our reliance on wholesale funding exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities during 2010 we originated approximately 295 billion in new or renewed lending commitments 

 

over the last two years we have opened 77 new branches and renovated approximately 145 others expanding key’s 14state branch network to 1033 branches further we plan to build an additional 3540 new branches in 2011 we also recently announced that we scored significantly higher than our four largest competitor banks in a third quarter of 2010 customer satisfaction survey conducted by the american customer satisfaction index our scores were significantly better than bank industry scores across multiple dimensions most notably in customer loyalty 

figure 4 selected financial data 

 

 

  

figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “tier 1 common equity” the tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors we believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations since the commencement of the scap in early 2009 the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital this focus on tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories this increased focus on tier 1 common equity is also present in the basel committee’s basel iii guidelines which us regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations expected to be issued in the summer of 2011 the enactment of the doddfrank act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities excluding tarp cpp preferred stock issued to the united states or any federal government entity before october 4 2010 being treated as tier 1 eligible capital this three year phaseout period which commences january 1 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier 2 capital 

 

tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier 1 common equity we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases figure 5 also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding nongaap measures 

 

the table also shows the computation for preprovision net revenue which is not formally defined by gaap management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 

 

nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

line of business results 

 

this section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments operating segments key community bank and key corporate bank during the first quarter of 2010 we realigned our reporting structure for our business segments prior to 2010 consumer finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or runoff portfolios and were included in our key corporate bank segment effective for all periods presented we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in other segments the automobile dealer floor plan business previously included in consumer finance has been realigned with the commercial banking line of business within the key community bank segment in addition other previously identified exit portfolios included in the key corporate bank segment have been moved to other segments note 21 “line of business results” describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business and explains “other segments” and “reconciling items” 

 

figure 6 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxableequivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income loss from continuing operations attributable to key” for each of the past three years

key community bank summary of operations 

 

as shown in figure 7 key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of 161 million for 2010 compared to a net loss of 56 million for 2009 and net income of 356 million for 2008 the increase in 2010 was the result of improvements in noninterest income reductions in noninterest expense and a significant decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses 

 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 104 million or 6 from 2009 as a result of a decrease in average earning assets a decline in average deposits and tighter deposit spreads average loans and leases declined by 27 billion or 9 due to reductions in the commercial loan and home equity portfolios while average deposits declined 29 billion or 6 the decrease in average deposits reflects a strong mix shift in the portfolio as average certificates of deposit declined 7 billion in 2010 highercosting certificates of deposit originated in prior years matured and repriced to current market rates partially offset by growth in noninterestbearing deposits and now accounts 

 

noninterest income increased by 18 million or 2 from 2009 due in part to an increase in trust and investment services income of 20 million derivative revenue increased 21 million from 2009 due primarily to a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives in addition electronic banking fees increased 12 million or 11 from 2009 these positive results were offset in part by a 28 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts resulting from both changes in customer behavior and the implementation of regulation e 

 

the provision for loan and lease losses declined by 318 million or 44 from 2009 key community bank’s provision in excess of chargeoffs for loan and lease losses declined by 372 million from 2009 reflecting improving economic conditions from one year ago the improvement in this provision was partially offset by a 54 million increase in net loan chargeoffs 

 

noninterest expense decreased by 106 million or 6 from 2009 due in part to a 40 million decrease in the fdic deposit insurance assessment also contributing to the yearoveryear change in noninterest expense was a charge of 21 million recorded to the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments in 2009 compared to a credit of 20 million recorded in 2010 finally corporate allocated costs declined 52 million the improvement in these areas was partially offset by higher business services and professional fees reflecting the cost of our thirdparty mortgage operations and the continued investment in our branch network over the last two years we have opened 77 new branches and renovated approximately 145 others as part of our branch modernization initiative 

 

in 2009 the 412 million decrease in net income attributable to key was due in part to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of 452 million coupled with a decrease in noninterest income of 57 million in addition noninterest expense 

increased 157 million primarily due to an increase in fdic deposit insurance expense these changes more than offset a 15 million increase in net interest income

key corporate bank summary of operations 

 

as shown in figure 8 key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of 434 million for 2010 compared to a net loss attributable to key of 1058 billion for 2009 and a net loss attributable to key of 136 million for 2008 the 2010 improvement was primarily due to a substantial decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses improvement in noninterest income and a decrease in noninterest expense this improvement was moderated by a decline in net interest income that resulted from a reduction in average earning assets 

 

taxableequivalent net interest income declined by 77 million or 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to a reduction in average earning assets offset in part by improved earning asset yields and an increase in deferred loan fees average earning assets fell by 71 billion or 24 due primarily to reductions in the commercial loan portfolios average deposits declined by 484 million or 4 

 

noninterest income increased by 170 million or 24 from 2009 due in part to net gains on certain commercial real estate investments during 2010 these gains on certain commercial real estate investments totaled 7 million as compared to losses of 137 million in 2009 which reflected reductions in the fair values of certain commercial real estate related investments made by the real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business also contributing to the improvement in noninterest 

income was a 48 million improvement in net losses from loan sales a 29 million improvement in investment banking income and a 28 million gain from the sale of tuition management systems in december 2010 the growth in noninterest income was offset in part by a 35 million decrease in trust and investment services income which was primarily due to reduced brokerage commissions in the institutional and capital markets line of business noninterest income was also adversely impacted by a 29 million decline in operating lease revenue and a 13 million decrease in letter of credit fees 

 

the provision for loan and lease losses declined by 1854 billion from 2009 reflecting lower levels of net loan chargeoffs primarily from the commercial loan portfolio key corporate bank’s provision for loan and lease losses was less than net loan chargeoffs by 635 million as we continued to experience improved asset quality 

 

during 2009 noninterest expense was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment charges totaling 241 million these charges resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value of the key corporate bank reporting unit caused by weakness in the financial markets and the writeoff of other intangible assets related to our leasing operation excluding these intangible asset charges noninterest expense declined by 86 million or 8 from 2009 due primarily to a 21 million credit to provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments recorded during 2010 compared to a 45 million charge recorded in 2009 a 20 million decline in operating lease expense lower fdic deposit insurance assessment and a decrease in internally allocated overhead and support costs also contributed to the decrease in noninterest expense these factors were partially offset by a 20 million increase in oreo expense and increases in both personnel expense and miscellaneous expense 

 

in 2009 results were less favorable than they were in 2008 due to a 38 million or 4 reduction in net interest income an 11 million or 2 decrease in noninterest income and a 1322 billion increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and a 121 million or 10 increase in noninterest expense noninterest expense in 2008 included an intangible asset impairment charge of 217 million compared to the 241 million charge in 2009 and a 7 million credit provision for losses on lending relatedcommitments compared to the 45 million charge in 2009 

 

consistent with our strategy to focus on core relationship businesses we sold tuition management systems in december 2010

other segments 

 

other segments consists of corporate treasury our principal investing unit and various exit portfolios that previously were included in the key corporate bank segment these exit portfolios were moved to other segments during the first quarter of 

2010 prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current reporting of the financial information for each segment other segments generated a net loss attributable to key of 14 million for 2010 compared to a net loss attributable to key of 359 million for 2009 the results reflect a 277 million increase in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of 331 million noninterest income results declined 173 million as increases in net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests of 70 million net gains on loan sales of 23 million and income from corporateowned life insurance of 22 million were more than offset by declines in net securities gains of 126 million gains on sales of leased equipment of 75 million and net gains of 78 million related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities during 2009 noninterest expense results declined 110 million as oreo expense decreased 46 million operating lease expense decreased 31 million and support and overhead charges decreased 20 million 

 

in 2009 other segments generated a net loss attributable to key of 359 million compared to a net loss attributable to key of 12 billion for 2008 the results reflect a 564 million increase in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of 165 million in 2008 net interest income was negatively impacted as a result of certain leveraged lease financing transactions that were challenged by the irs noninterest income results improved 315 million as a result of increases in net securities gains of 125 million net gains of 78 million related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities during 2009 gains on sales of leased equipment of 55 million and net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests of 51 million noninterest expense results declined 197 million as the oreo expense increase of 54 million was more than offset by a decline in various other expense categories 

 

results of operations 

 

net interest income 

 

one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including 

 

  

to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxableequivalent basis” ie as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate for example 100 of taxexempt income would be presented as 154 an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 — would yield 100 

 

figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense and their respective yields or rates over the past six years this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxableequivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years the net interest margin which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 

 

taxableequivalent net interest income for 2010 was 2537 billion and the net interest margin was 326 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 2406 billion and a net interest margin of 283 for the prior year the increase in the 2010 net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts this benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset during 2010 by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year resulting primarily from pay downs on loans we also experienced improved yields on loans due to lower levels of nonperforming loans compared to the prior year funding costs were also reduced by maturities of longterm debt and the 2009 exchanges of capital securities for our common shares 

 

in the prior year the net interest margin remained under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels this resulted in a larger decrease in the interest rates on earning assets than that experienced for interestbearing liabilities further compression of the 2009 net interest margin came from higher levels of nonperforming assets and the termination of certain leveraged lease financing arrangements 

 

average earning assets for 2010 totaled 784 billion which was 67 billion or 8 lower than the 2009 level this reduction reflects a 124 billion decrease in loans during the year caused by soft demand for credit paydowns on our portfolios as 

commercial clients deleveraged and the runoff in our exit portfolios the decline in loans was partially offset by an increase of 76 billion in securities available for sale 

 

the size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during 2010 and 2009

noninterest income 

 

noninterest income for 2010 was 1954 billion down 81 million or 4 from 2009 in 2009 noninterest income increased by 188 million or 10 compared to 2008 

 

several significant items affected noninterest income in 2010 and 2009 in 2010 we realized a gain of 28 million from the sale of tuition management systems which is recorded in miscellaneous income in 2009 significant items include net gains of 125 million from the repositioning of the securities portfolio 78 million recorded in connection with the exchange of common shares for capital securities 32 million from the sale of our claim associated with the lehman brothers’ bankruptcy and 105 million gain from the sale of visa inc shares 

 

excluding the above items noninterest income for 2010 increased by 231 million as shown in figure 11 we benefited from a 187 million increase in investment banking and capital market income 76 million in net gains from loan sales in 2010 compared to a 1 million loss in 2009 and 66 million in net gains from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2010 compared to a 4 million loss in 2009 these favorable results were partially offset by a 79 million decline in net gains on sale of leased equipment 

 

significant items also influence a comparison of noninterest income for 2009 with that reported for 2008 we recorded a 105 million gain from the sale of visa inc shares in 2009 compared to a 165 million gain from the partial redemption of visa shares during 2008 

 

excluding the above items noninterest income for 2009 increased by 13 million as shown in figure 11 we benefited from an 81 million reduction in net losses from loan sales a 59 million increase in net gains on sales of leased equipment a 50 million decrease in net losses from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interest and an increase in other income due primarily to mortgage banking activities and the volatility associated with the hedge accounting applied to debt instruments these factors were substantially offset by less favorable results from investment banking and capital 

market activities as well as reductions in trust and investment services income service charges on deposit accounts and operating lease income 

 

figure 11 noninterest income 

 

 

 

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change 

 

trust and investment services income 

 

trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income the primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in figure 12 the 2010 decrease of 15 million or 3 is primarily attributable to lower fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and fees the increase in personal asset management and custody fees is largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional asset management and custody fees 

 

in 2009 we experienced a decrease of 50 million or 10 in trust and investment services income which is attributable to reductions in both institutional and personal asset management income as well as lower income from brokerage commissions and fees 

 

figure 12 trust and investment services income 

 

 

 

a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management at december 31 2010 our bank trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 

598 billion compared to 669 billion at december 31 2009 as shown in figure 13 most of the decrease was attributable to reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios offset by an increase in the equity portfolio the decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities a decline on spreads and client departures when clients’ securities are lent out the borrower must provide us with cash collateral which is invested during the term of the loan the difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client this business although profitable generates a significantly lower rate of return commensurate with the lower level of risk than other types of assets under management the decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies the decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of austin 

 

figure 13 assets under management 

 

 

 

 

  

service charges on deposit accounts 

 

the 2010 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts is due primarily to changing client behaviors involving lower overdraft transactions which generate overdraft fees as well as a decline in other deposit service charge related fees a recent component of the decrease was due to the implementation of regulation e which went into effect on july 1 2010 for new clients and august 15 2010 for our existing clients the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated with existing regulation e rules was in line with our expectations 

 

the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to lower overdraft transactions which generated fewer overdraft fees additionally because of the prevailing low interest rates and unlimited fdic insurance our corporate clients maintained larger amounts on deposit which has the effect of reducing transaction service charges on their noninterestbearing deposit accounts 

 

operating lease income 

 

reduced originations of operating leases in 2010 were due to the related economics and resulted in a 54 million decrease in operating equipment leases recorded in the equipment finance line of business accordingly as shown in figure 15 depreciation expense associated with operating leases also declined the 43 million decrease in 2009 operating lease income is also due to reduced originations 

 

investment banking and capital markets income loss 

 

as shown in figure 14 income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased 187 million in 2010 other investment income increased 109 million from 2009 resulting from lower losses from changes in the fair value of certain investments made by our funds management group within real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business in key corporate bank at december 31 2010 these securities had a carrying amount of approximately 1 million representing 3 of their face value dealer trading and derivative losses decreased 54 million from 2009 due largely to a 36 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives and 14 million decrease related to credit default 

swap valuation adjustments investment banking income also increased 29 million due primarily to increased levels of debt and equity financings 

 

the 2009 decline was driven by losses related to certain commercial real estate related investments primarily due to changes in their fair values net losses from investments made by the real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business rose by 68 million from 2008 we also experienced a 36 million increase in losses associated with dealer trading and derivatives due largely to credit default swap valuation adjustments 

 

figure 14 investment banking and capital markets income loss 

 

 

 

net gains losses from loan sales 

 

we sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles of the overall loan portfolio during 2010 we recorded 76 million of net gains from loan sales compared to net losses of 1 million during 2009 we saw market liquidity strengthen beginning in the latter half of 2010 and took the opportunity to continue to sell our nonperforming loans we were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at values close to their carrying values recorded on our books the types of loans sold during 2010 and 2009 are presented in figure 22 

 

net gains losses from principal investing 

 

principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privatelyheld companies our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to mediumsized businesses these investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 898 million at december 31 2010 and 10 billion at december 31 2009 we had 66 million in gains from principal investing for 2010 as presented in figure 11 these gains are derived largely from changes in fair values in our indirect and venture capital areas as well as sales of principal investments 

 

noninterest expense 

 

as shown in figure 15 noninterest expense for 2010 was 3034 billion down 520 million or 15 from 2009 in 2009 noninterest expense rose by 78 million or 2 from 2008 

 

in 2010 personnel expense decreased by 43 million excluding intangible assets impairment charges of 241 million nonpersonnel expense decreased by 279 million due primarily to a 115 million decrease in provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments a 53 million decrease in fdic assessment expense a 53 million decrease in operating lease expense and a 29 million decrease in oreo expense 

 

the decrease in provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments is due to a 48 million credit during 2010 as a result of improved credit quality and a lower level of unfunded commitments 

 

fdic assessment expense decreased because we recorded a onetime special assessment in the second quarter of 2009 the result of opting out of the tag program effective july 1 2010 and because insured deposits decreased 

 

oreo expense decreased as a result of improved liquidity for income producing properties in 2010 resulting in fewer writedowns compared to one year ago 

 

in 2009 personnel expense decreased by 67 million from 2008 excluding intangible assets impairment charges nonpersonnel expense increased by 373 million due primarily to a 167 million increase in the fdic deposit insurance assessment a 81 million increase in costs associated with oreo a 46 million increase in business services and professional fees and a 67 million provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments recorded during the current year compared to a 26 million credit recorded for 2008 additionally nonpersonnel expense for 2009 was reduced by a 23 million credit included in “miscellaneous expense” representing the reversal of the remaining litigation reserve associated with the previously reported 

honsador litigation settled in september 2008 the increase in nonpersonnel expense compared to 2009 was moderated by decreases of 29 million in operating lease expense and 15 million in marketing expense more information about the intangible assets impairment charges is provided in this section under the heading “intangible assets impairment”

as shown in figure 16 personnel expense the largest category of our noninterest expense decreased by 43 million or 3 in 2010 following a 67 million or 4 decline in 2009 from 2008 the 2010 decrease was due largely to a 79 million decrease in our employee benefits expense the employee benefits expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions for more information related to our pension plans see note 19 “employee benefits” severance expense also decreased by 17 million the decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by 44 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability and an increase of 1 million in stockbased compensation the 8 million increase in salaries includes an 18 million decline in levels of deferred compensation which has the effect of increasing salaries and the impact of base salary increases which are partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and the impact of a 7 decrease in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees from 2009 

 

the 2009 decrease was due largely to a reduction in incentive compensation accruals and salaries expense the 44 million decrease in salaries includes a 38 million decline in levels of deferred compensation which has the effect of increasing salaries and the impact of base salary increases which are partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and the impact of an 8 decrease in the number of average fulltime equivalent employees we also experienced a substantial increase in pension expense in 2009 attributed primarily to lower expected returns and an increase in the amortization of losses resulting from the decrease in the value of pension plan assets following steep declines in the equity markets in 2008

intangible assets impairment 

 

during the third quarter of 2009 we recorded a 45 million charge to writeoff intangible assets other than goodwill associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets during the first quarter of 2009 we determined that the estimated fair value of our key corporate bank reporting unit was less than the carrying amount reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets as a result we recorded a pretax noncash accounting charge of 223 million of which 27 million related to the discontinued operations of austin as a result of this charge we have now written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to key corporate bank 

 

operating lease expense 

 

the decrease in operating lease expense in both 2010 and 2009 is primarily attributable to product runoff income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in figure 11 as “operating lease income” 

 

fdic assessment 

 

fdic assessment expense was unfavorably impacted in 2009 primarily by a one time special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009 this increase was partially offset by opting out of the tag program effective july 1 2010 

 

oreo expense 

 

oreo expense decreased in 2010 primarily as a result of 7 million in net gain on sales recorded in 2010 compared to net loss on sales of 26 million in 2009 oreo expense increased 81 million in 2009 from 2008 due largely to valuation writedowns totaling 60 million 

 

provision credit for losses on lendingrelated commitments 

 

the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments fluctuated during the prior year as a result of variability in underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments 

 

income taxes 

 

we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of 186 million for 2010 compared to a tax benefit of 1035 billion for 2009 and a provision of 437 million for 2008 the effective tax rate which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes was 234 for 2010 compared to 450 for 2009 and 514 for 2008 

 

our federal tax benefit expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate primarily because we generate income from investments in taxadvantaged assets such as corporateowned life insurance earn credits associated with investments in lowincome housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves during 2010 we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of 32 million as the result of management’s change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in nonus subsidiaries additionally in 2009 we recorded a 106 million credit to income taxes due primarily to the settlement of irs audits for the tax years 19972006 the credit includes a final adjustment of 80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues in 2008 we recorded 586 million tax provision in connection with the leverage lease tax litigation which became final in 2009

at december 31 2010 total loans outstanding were 501 billion compared to 588 billion at the end of 2009 and 728 billion at the end of 2008 loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business and excluded from total loans were 65 billion at december 31 2010 35 billion at december 31 2009 and 37 billion at december 31 2008 further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section entitled “consumer loan portfolio” within this discussion the decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most of our portfolios with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio 

 

commercial loan portfolio 

 

commercial loans outstanding were 345 billion at december 31 2010 a decrease of 74 billion or 18 since december 31 2009 this decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients’ use of the strength of the capital markets to raise debt and equity pay downs on our portfolios and the runoff in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk we are beginning to see pockets of improvements in commercial lending as business is strengthening in certain regions 

 

commercial financial and agricultural as shown in figure 17 our commercial financial and agricultural loans also referred to as “commercial and industrial” represent 33 of our total loan portfolio at december 31 2010 and 2009 and are the largest component of our total loans the loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large middle market and small business clients these loans decreased 28 billion or 15 from one year ago most of the decrease which occurred during the first half of 2010 was attributable to our clients using the capital markets to pay down their bank debt in the latter half of 2010 our commercial financial and agricultural portfolio began to stabilize 

 

commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans represent approximately 23 of our total loan portfolio these loans include both owner and nonowneroccupied properties and constitute approximately 34 of our commercial loan portfolio as shown in figure 18 at december 31 2010 our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of 95 billion and construction loans of 21 billion the total commercial real estate loans for 2010 and 2009 represent 23 and 26 respectively of our total loans nonowneroccupied loans represent 16 of our total loans and owneroccupied loans represent 7 of our total loans the average mortgage loan originated during 2010 was 29 million and our largest mortgage loan at december 31 2010 had a balance of 121 million at december 31 2010 our average construction loan commitment was 38 million our largest construction loan commitment was 49 million 481 million of which was outstanding at december 31 2010 

 

our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources our 14state banking franchise and real estate capital and corporate banking services a national line of business within key corporate bank that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system this line of business deals primarily with nonowneroccupied properties generally properties for which at least 50 of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties and accounted for approximately 60 of our average yeartodate commercial real estate loans during 2010 compared to 59 one year ago our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and owners as shown in figure 18 this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank

during 2010 nonperforming loans related to our nonowneroccupied properties decreased by 680 million attributable to improved asset quality and market conditions this compares to an increase of 605 million during 2009 which was due to the deteriorating market conditions in both the income properties and residential properties segments of our commercial real estate construction portfolio as previously reported we have undertaken a process to reduce our exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans 

 

the secondary market for income property loans has been severely constrained for the past three years and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future in years prior to the economic downturn we did not provide permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgagebacked securities market or other lenders with other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained we are currently providing interim financing for certain of our relationship clients when their commercial real estate construction projects are completed during 2010 and 2009 we extended the maturities for up to five years of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion we applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longerterm extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates in cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements we have transferred these loans to the asset recovery group for resolution in 2010 there were 204 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans of which 67 million related to commercial real estate 

 

as shown in figure 18 at december 31 2010 68 of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowneroccupied properties compared to 71 at december 31 2009 approximately 23 and 40 of these loans were construction loans at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively typically these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases driving rental rates and occupancy rates down as we have experienced during 2010 we expect vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into 2011 

 

commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom and certain sectors ie apartments are showing solid signs of improvement according to property and portfolio research inc vacancy fell in the third quarter of 2010 in every major property type but it remained above yearago levels with the exception of apartments rent growth remains flat to negative again with the exception of apartments and is at or nearing a trough however modest declines are possible over the next year in office retail and warehouse property types once rents bottom the anticipated recovery will likely be modest 

 

if the economic recovery stalls andor job growth continues to disappoint vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain the resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components which comprise 27 of our commercial real estate loans 

 

commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007 having experienced increases of approximately 30 since 2005 and 90 since 2001 the most recent moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property price index december 2010 shows a 42 drop in values from the peak up 32 in the past year as of october 2010 prices were up a modest 13 over the prior month the second consecutive monthly gain while overall prices may be reaching a bottom market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location competition for the best assets in the top markets is driving prices higher while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative 

 

if the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market ie vacancy rates the stability of rental income and asset values and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 

 

commercial lease financing we conduct financing arrangements through our equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business commercial lease financing receivables represented 19 of commercial loans at december 31 2010 and 18 at december 31 2009 as previously reported we ceased conducting new business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009 

 

commercial loan modification and restructuring 

 

certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower in many cases borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital collateral guarantees or income sources 

 

modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs in accordance with applicable accounting guidance tdr classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 

 

our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions principal deferral or forgiveness of principal loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types the table below provides the amount of tdrs by the primary type of concession made at each period end since our volume of tdr activity is relatively new over the last five quarters it is too early to gauge the success of the different types of concessions our success will be significantly influenced by economic conditions going forward although we have restructured these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrowers given the uncertainty of the current economic situation we are not able to predict how these restructured notes will ultimately perform 

 

figure 19 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs 

 

figure 19 commercial loan accruing and nonaccruing tdrs 

 

 

 

  

figure 20 quantifies restructured loans tdrs using our threenote structure 

 

figure 20 commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status 

 

 

 

 59 

 

the benefits derived from multiple note tdrs are recognized when the underlying assets predominantly commercial real estate have been stabilized with a level of leverage supportable by ongoing cash flows rightsizing the a note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition similarly appropriately sized a notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset deleveraged and sustainable capital structure often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressedfire sales 

 

as the objective of the multiple notes tdr is to achieve a fully performing and wellrated a note we focus on sizing the a note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards this typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 12 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years 

 

the b note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal the b note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the a note is under consideration in many cases the b note has then been chargedoff contemporaneously with the a note being returned to accrual status alternatively both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above in many cases where a three a b c note structure has been utilized the c notes are fully chargedoff at the time of the tdr in the very few instances where the c note is not chargedoff there is a pending equity event additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the c note balance shortly after the tdr 

 

all loans processed as a tdr including a notes and any nonchargedoff b or c notes are reported as tdrs during the year in which they are consummated returning an a note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time 

 

our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment collateral is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the a note with a sufficient excess generally 20 although our policy is a guideline considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances 

 

extensions 

 

certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity however due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the marketwide decline in leasing activity and rental rates an increased number of loans have been extended extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship the status of the project and nearterm prospects for both the client and the collateral in all cases pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms ie amortization covenants and term that are appropriate for the risk typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown increased amortization additional collateral increased guarantees andor a cash flow sweep as previously mentioned some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option pricing and loan terms cannot be altered most project loans by their nature are “collateraldependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan 

 

pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any therefore pricing may remain the same eg the loan is already priced at or above current market we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made in the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 

 

guarantors 

 

a detailed guarantor analysis is conducted 1 for all new extensions of credit 2 at the time of any material modificationextension and 3 typically annually as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures this analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets income statements tax returns and real estate schedules 

 

while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities including size quality and nature of asset base 

net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value leverage standing liquidity recurring cash flow contingent and direct debt obligations and near term debt maturities 

 

borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90120 days of the calendarfiscal year end income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly in some cases disclosure of certain information including liquidity certifications status of asset sales or debt resolutions and real estate schedules may be required more frequently 

 

we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent in limited circumstances we would not seek to enforce the guaranty including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy andor it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition we are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment andor the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss cost and the expense of collections 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had 507 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 10 and were accounted for as performing loans these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization a satisfactory borrower payment history and acceptable guarantor support 

 

consumer loan portfolio 

 

consumer loans outstanding decreased by 13 billion or 8 from one year ago as shown in figure 41 in the “credit risk management” section the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment 

 

the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio virtually all of this portfolio 93 at december 31 2010 is derived primarily from the regional banking line of business within our key community bank the remainder of the portfolio which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007 was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments home equity loans within key community bank decreased by 534 million or 5 over the past twelve months 

 

figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five years as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole 

 

figure 21 home equity loans 

 

 

 

  

as previously reported we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio we expect the portfolio continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealeroriginated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products and discontinue the education lending business we ceased originating new education loans effective december 5 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations 

 

in the latter half of 2010 there has been public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders our number of home loan foreclosures is small the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by key and third parties initiated per month through december 31 2010 is 140 compared to approximately 238000 such mortgage loans and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio a review of our foreclosure processes which is still ongoing has not uncovered any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits 

 

loans held for sale 

 

as shown in note 4 “loans and loans held for sale” our loans held for sale increased to 467 million at december 31 2010 from 443 million at december 31 2009 loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business which are excluded from total loans held for sale at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 totaled 15 million and 434 million respectively 

 

at december 31 2010 loans held for sale included 118 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by 53 million from december 31 2009 and 110 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by 29 million from december 31 2009 in the absence of quoted market prices we use valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost the models are based on thirdparty data as well as assumptions related to prepayment speeds default rates funding cost discount rates and other relevant market available inputs in light of the volatility in the financial markets we have reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect current market conditions as a result no significant adjustments to our assumptions were required during 2010 

 

during 2010 we recorded net unrealized losses of 10 million and net realized gains of 44 million on our loans held for sale portfolio these net gains are reported in “net gains losses from loan sales” on the income statement we have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry having exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006 

 

loan sales 

 

as shown in figure 22 during 2010 we sold 12 billion of commercial real estate loans 16 billion of residential real estate loans 370 million of commercial loans and 64 million of commercial lease financing most of these sales came from the heldforsale portfolio additionally we sold 487 million of education loans included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet which are excluded from figure 22 due to unfavorable market conditions we have not securitized any education loans since 2006 

 

among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are 

 

  

figure 22 summarizes our loan sales for 2010 and 2009

figure 23 shows loans that are either administered or serviced by us but not recorded on the balance sheet the table includes loans that have been sold 

figure 23 loans administered or serviced 

 

 

 

  

in the event of default by a borrower we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately 736 million of the 118 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31 2010 additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “recourse agreement with fnma” 

 

we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold we earn noninterest income recorded as “other income” from fees for servicing or administering loans this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets in addition we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 9 “mortgage servicing assets” 

 

maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

 

figure 24 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates at december 31 2010 approximately 38 of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year 

 

figure 24 remaining maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates 

 

 

 

  

securities 

 

our securities portfolio totaled 220 billion at december 31 2010 compared to 167 billion at december 31 2009 at each of these dates most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale with the remainder consisting of heldtomaturity securities of less than 25 million 

 

securities available for sale 

 

the majority of our securities availableforsale portfolio consists of cmos which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgagebacked securities cmos generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements at december 31 2010 we had 217 billion invested in cmos and other mortgagebacked securities in the availableforsale portfolio compared to 164 billion at december 31 2009 

 

as shown in figure 25 all of our mortgagebacked securities are issued by governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value we employ an outside bond pricing service to determine the fair value at which these securities should be recorded on the balance sheet in performing the valuations the pricing service relies on models that consider securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions we review valuations derived from the models to ensure they are consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets 

 

figure 25 mortgagebacked securities by issuer 

 

 

 

during 2010 we had net gains of 203 million from cmos and other mortgagebacked securities all of which were unrealized the net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the aoci component of shareholders’ equity we continue to maintain a moderate assetsensitive exposure to nearterm changes in interest rates 

 

we periodically evaluate our securities availableforsale portfolio in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning 

 

in addition the size and composition of our securities availableforsale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required or elect to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits although we generally use debt securities for this purpose other assets such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles 

 

during 2010 our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs we purchased 98 billion in cmos and had maturities and cash flows of 47 billion the purchases were in cmos issued by governmentsponsored entities or gnma we are able to either pledge these securities to the federal reserve or federal home loan bank for secured borrowing arrangements sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future

heldtomaturity securities 

 

foreign bonds and preferred equity securities constitute most of our heldtomaturity securities figure 27 shows the composition yields and remaining maturities of these securities

other investments 

 

principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 66 of other investments at december 31 2010 they include direct investments investments made in a particular company as well as indirect investments investments made through funds that include other investors principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value 898 million at december 31 2010 and 10 billion at december 31 2009 

 

in addition to principal investments “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments such as certain real estaterelated investments that are carried at fair value as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost 

 

most of our other investments are not traded on an active market we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information among other things our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential the values of public companies in comparable businesses the risks associated with the particular business or investment type current market 

conditions the nature and duration of resale restrictions the issuer’s payment history our knowledge of the industry and third party data during 2010 net gains from our principal investing activities including results attributable to noncontrolling interests totaled 66 million which includes 59 million of net unrealized gains these net gains are recorded as “net gains losses from principal investing” on the income statement 

 

deposits and other sources of funds 

 

domestic deposits are our primary source of funding during 2010 these deposits averaged 625 billion and represented 80 of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets compared to 662 billion and 78 during 2009 the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 9 in the section entitled “net interest income” 

 

the decrease in average domestic deposits compared to 2009 was due to a decline in certificates of deposit 100000 or more and other time deposits this decline was offset by an increase in now and money market deposit accounts and noninterestbearing deposits the mix of deposits continues to change as highercosting certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts such as now and money market savings accounts or look for other alternatives for investing in the current lowrate environment 

 

wholesale funds consisting of deposits in our foreign office and shortterm borrowings averaged 35 billion during 2010 compared to 43 billion during 2009 the change resulted from a 124 million increase in foreign office deposits and a 426 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase which was offset partially by a 14 billion decline in bank notes and other shortterm borrowings 

 

substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic accordingly we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic on november 17 2009 the fdic published a final rule to announce an amended dif restoration plan requiring depository institutions such as keybank to prepay on december 30 2009 their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 on that date keybank paid the fdic 539 million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods for 2010 our fdic insurance assessment was 124 million at the end of the year we had 388 million of prepaid fdic insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet 

 

on february 7 2011 the fdic adopted their final rule on assessments under the final rule which is effective on april 1 2011 keybank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from 025 to 45 for each 100 of its new assessment base depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating keybank’s regulatory rating ability to withstand asset and funding related stress and relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybank’s failure we estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be 60 to 90 million 

 

at december 31 2010 key had 68 billion in time deposits of 100000 or more figure 28 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits

capital 

 

at december 31 2010 our shareholders’ equity was 111 billion up 454 million from december 31 2009 the following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity for other factors that contributed to the change see the section entitled “statement of changes in equity”

effective january 1 2010 we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance that required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts classified as discontinued assets and liabilities thereby adding 28 billion in assets liabilities and equity to our balance sheet as a result of adopting this new guidance we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment aftertax of 45 million to beginning retained earnings on january 1 2010 

 

dividends 

 

during 2010 we made dividend payments of 125 million to the us treasury on our series b preferred stock as a participant in the us treasury’s cpp 

 

also we made four quarterly dividend payments of 19375 per share or 6 million per quarter on our series a preferred stock 

 

additionally during 2010 we made four quarterly dividend payments of 01 per share or 9 million per quarter on our common shares 

 

common shares outstanding 

 

our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol key at december 31 2010 our book value per common share was 952 based on 8803 million shares outstanding at december 31 2010 compared to 904 based on 8785 million shares outstanding at december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 our tangible book value per common share was 845 compared to 794 at december 31 2009

at december 31 2010 we had 657 million treasury shares compared to 678 million treasury shares at december 31 2009 during 2010 shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stockbased compensation awards and for other corporate purposes 

 

we repurchase common shares periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the board of directors the program does not have an expiration date and we have outstanding board authority to repurchase 139 million shares we did not repurchase any common shares during 2010 or 2009 further in accordance with the terms of our participation in the cpp until the earlier of three years after the issuance of or such time as the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock issued by us under that program we will not be able to repurchase any of our common shares without the approval of the us treasury subject to certain limited exceptions eg for purchases in connection with benefit plans 

 

capital availability and management 

 

as a result of market disruptions in previous periods we closely monitor the availability of capital which had been severely restricted for financial services companies to different degrees since august 2007 while we have been successful in raising additional capital lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per common share results while the capital markets have recently been more favorable we cannot predict whether those more favorable market conditions will continue 

 

we determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses in that regard we will continue to emphasize our client relationship strategy 

 

capital adequacy 

 

capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance all of our capital ratios remain strong at december 31 2010 our strong capital and improved liquidity position us to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the doddfrank act our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 1210 at december 31 2010 compared to 1143 at december 31 2009 our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 819 at december 31 2010 compared to 756 at december 31 2009 

 

banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries riskbased capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “riskweighted assets” riskweighted assets consist of total assets plus certain offbalance sheet and market items subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors currently banks and bank holding companies must maintain at a minimum tier 1 capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 400 and total capital as a percent of riskweighted assets of 800 as of december 31 2010 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio increased 241 basis points from 2009 to 1516 and our total riskbased capital ratio increased 217 basis points from 2009 to 1912 

 

another indicator of capital adequacy the leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve’s riskadjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 300 all other bhcs must maintain a minimum ratio of 400 as of december 31 2010 our leverage ratio increased by 130 basis points from 2009 to 1302 

 

the enactment of the doddfrank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities excluding cpp preferred stock issued to the united states or any federal government entity before october 4 2010 being eligible tier 1 riskbased capital 

 

this three year phaseout period which commences january 1 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier 2 capital these changes in effect apply the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs savings and loan holding companies and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important 

 

as of december 31 2010 our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio represented 1516 1302 and 1912 respectively the trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp and union state bank capital trusts contribute 18 billion or 229 196 and 229 basis points to our tier 1 riskbased capital ratio tier 1 leverage ratio and total riskbased capital ratio respectively as of december 31 2010 

 

under the fdia prompt corrective action standards federal bank regulators group fdicinsured depository institutions into five categories ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” a “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 600 for tier 1 riskbased capital 500 for tier 1 leverage capital 1000 for total riskbased 

capital and must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure if these provisions applied to bank holding companies we would qualify as “well capitalized” at december 31 2010 we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change analysis on a pro forma basis accounting for the phaseout of our trust preferred securities as tier 1 eligible and therefore as tier 2 instead as of december 31 2010 also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines with the pro forma tier 1 riskbased capital ratio pro forma leverage ratio and pro forma total capital ratio being 1284 1098 and 1909 respectively the current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or keybank 

 

traditionally the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations as a result of the financial crisis the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 riskbased capital known as tier 1 common equity and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies including keycorp because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity essentially tier 1 riskbased capital less preferred stock qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 riskbased capital such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard the modifications mandated by the doddfrank act are consistent with the renewed focus on tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks bhcs and covered nonbank financial companies which resulted from the financial crisis because tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure figure 5 in the “highlights of our 2010 performance” section reconciles key shareholders’ equity the gaap performance measure to tier 1 common equity the corresponding nongaap measure our tier 1 common equity ratio was 934 at december 31 2010 compared to 750 at december 31 2009 

 

at december 31 2010 we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of 442 million compared to 569 million at december 31 2009 in prior years we had been in a net deferred tax liability position generally for riskbased capital purposes deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarterend date based on its projected future taxable income for the year or ii 10 of the amount of an institution’s tier 1 capital based on these restrictions at december 31 2010 158 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from tier 1 capital and riskweighted assets compared to 514 million at december 31 2009 we anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for riskbased capital purposes will decline in coming quarters 

 

basel iii 

 

on december 15 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation now officially identified as “basel iii” 

 

as discussed more fully in this report’s supervision and regulation section beginning on page 5 basel iii requires higher and better quality capital better risk coverage the introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop to the riskbased requirement measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress the use of contingent capital to provide an additional level of protection for depositors and creditors and the introduction of two global liquidity standards basel iii introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for tier 1 common equity when the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included the resulting minimum levels for tier 1 capital and total riskbased capital will be higher than the us’s current “wellcapitalized” minimums we have prepared pro forma estimates of our capital ratios using the basel iii capital guidelines these estimates indicate that our capital levels are currently above the basel iii minimums including the capital conservation buffer and the phasingout of trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital pursuant to the doddfrank act the us banking regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to basel iii the basel iii final capital framework provides for implementation to commence january 1 2013 in light of basel iii’s timeline and us regulators support for basel iii a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be issued in mid2011

the doddfrank act’s reform of deposit insurance 

 

the doddfrank act makes permanent the current fdic deposit insurance limit of 250000 and provides for temporary unlimited fdic deposit insurance until january 1 2013 for non interestbearing demand transaction accounts at all insured 

depository institutions effective december 31 2010 concurrent with the expiration date of the current tag program extension accordingly effective december 31 2010 keybank will again offer noninterestbearing demand transaction accounts with unlimited fdic deposit insurance similar to when it participated in the tlgp 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we are party to various types of offbalance sheet arrangements which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 

 

variable interest entities 

 

a vie is a partnership limited liability company trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria 

 

  

in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations we also consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie we are considered to be the primary beneficiary additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “basis of presentation” and note 11 “variable interest entities” 

 

we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20 to 50 but not controlling unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20 generally are carried at cost investments held by our registered brokerdealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 

 

commitments to extend credit or funding 

 

loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay further information about our loan commitments at december 31 2010 is presented in note 16 “commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees” under the heading “commitments to extend credit or funding” figure 32 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan 

 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other offbalance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and other relationships such as liquidity support provided to assetbacked commercial paper conduits indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees information about such arrangements is provided in note 16 under the heading “other offbalance sheet risk” 

contractual obligations 

 

figure 32 summarizes our significant contractual obligations and lendingrelated and other offbalance sheet commitments at december 31 2010 by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire 

 

figure 32 contractual obligations and other offbalance sheet commitments 

 

 

 

  

guarantees 

 

we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties as guarantor we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate foreign exchange rate or other variable including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event these variables known as underlyings may be related to an asset or liability or another entity’s failure to perform under a contract additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 16 under the heading “guarantees” 

 

risk management 

 

overview 

 

like all financial services companies we engage in business activities and assume the related risks the most significant risks we face are credit liquidity market compliance operational strategic and reputation risks we must properly and effectively 

identify assess measure monitor control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 

 

during 2010 our management team continued to enhance our erm program our erm committee which consists of the chief executive officer and other senior executives is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy policy framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company the erm committee reports to the risk management committee of our board of directors annually the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories we continue to enhance our erm program and related practices and to use a riskadjusted capital framework to manage risks this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 

 

our board of directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprisewide risks in a manner that is effective balanced and adds value for the shareholders the board inquires about risk practices reviews the portfolio of risks compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging to assist in these efforts the board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the audit committee and the risk management committee 

 

the audit committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit financial reporting compliance risk and legal matters the implementation management and evaluation of operational risk and controls information security and fraud risk and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance 

 

the risk management committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk market risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk including the actions taken to mitigate these risks as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing the risk management committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital the risk management committee reviews the erm reports and in conjunction with the audit committee reviews reports of material changes to the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee charters and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 

 

the audit and risk management committees meet jointly as appropriate to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities in addition to regularly scheduled bimonthly meetings the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 

 

federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and comport with regulatory expectations 

 

market risk management 

 

the values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates foreign exchange rates equity values commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective market rates or prices for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline if market interest rates increase similarly the value of the us dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies the holder of a financial instrument faces “market risk” when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations 

 

interest rate risk management 

 

interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity in accordance with our risk appetite and within policy limits established by the erm committee 

 

interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates including economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk gap risk yield curve risk and option risk 

  

net interest income simulation analysis   the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions and the current and projected interest rate environments the simulation assumes that projections of our on and offbalance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends targets and plans established by the alco committee and the lines of business and consensus economic forecasts 

 

typically the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months and term rates were to move in a similar fashion in light of the low interest rate environment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment the analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables including other market interest rates and the mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity including a sustained flat yield curve an inverted slope yield curve changes in credit spreads an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities other loan and deposit balance changes investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies 

 

simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the following inputs balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates realized investment hedging and funding activities actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from anticipated or unknown events we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and offbalance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile 

 

figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31 2010 and 2009 at december 31 2010 our simulated exposure to a change in shortterm interest rates was moderately asset sensitive alco policy limits for risk management call for the identification of actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4 as shown in figure 33 we are operating within these limits 

figure 33 simulated change in net interest income 

 

 

 

as interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time we have gradually shifted from a liabilitysensitive position to an assetsensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities and this has served to moderate further increases in the assetsensitive positioning our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and pricing of loan and deposit flows as changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile 

 

the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure 33 net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 

 

we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a twoyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelvemonth horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 

 

economic value of equity modeling   eve complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve and twentyfour month horizons eve measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths under the current level of market interest rates the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we identify actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15 in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines 

 

management of interest rate exposure   we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate asset liability management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 

 

figure 34 shows all swap positions which we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixedpay variable” interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note 8 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

figure 34 portfolio swaps by interest rate risk management strategy 

 

 

 

  

derivatives not designated in hedge relationships 

 

our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in note 8 we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio using two years of historical information the model estimates the maximum potential oneday loss with a 95 confidence level statistically this means that losses will exceed var on average five out of 100 trading days or three to four times each quarter 

 

we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by the risk capital committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the market risk committee established as part of key’s erm program at december 31 2010 the aggregate oneday trading limit set by the committee was 69 million we are operating within these constraints during 2010 our aggregate daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 18 million 12 million and 25 million respectively in 2009 our aggregate daily average minimum and maximum var amounts were 28 million 21 million and 37 million respectively 

 

in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis we monitor loss limits use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests we report our market risk exposure to the risk management committee of the board of directors 

 

liquidity risk management 

 

we define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 

 

governance structure 

 

we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions it also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient funding 

 

oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the keycorp board’s risk management committee the keybank board of directors the erm committee and the alco these groups regularly review various liquidity reports including liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make when liquidity pressure is elevated monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive we meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues in addition we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds 

 

factors affecting liquidity 

 

our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

on november 1 2010 moody’s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities announced the downgrade of ratings of ten large us regional banks including keybank previously identified as benefiting from systemic support keybank’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt ratings received a one notch downgrade from p1 to p 2 a2 to a3 and a3 to baa1 respectively 

 

the new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by moody’s in connection with the securitizations that key services and impact the ability of keybank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by key and rated by moody’s these escrow deposit balances range from 150 to 185 billion since the downgrade keybank has been in discussions with moody’s regarding an alternative investment vehicle for these funds that would be acceptable to moody’s and maintain the funds at keybank subsequent to moody’s announcement that was publicly issued on january 19 2011 moody’s indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011 as a result of this decision by moody’s keybank has determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets keybank has ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position 

 

managing liquidity risk 

 

we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a “heightened monitoring mode” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they estimate the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 

 

we continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio during the third quarter of 2009 our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source 

 

we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding the portfolio at december 31 2010 totaled 117 billion the liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of 91 billion of unpledged securities 22 billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and 362 million of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account additionally as of december 31 2010 our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was 113 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and 18 billion at the federal home loan bank 

 

longterm liquidity strategy 

 

our longterm liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding key community bank supports our client insightdriven relationship strategy with the objective of achieving greater reliance on depositbased funding to reduce our liquidity risk we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor this strategy our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90100 which we calculate as total loans loans heldforsale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 

 

sources of liquidity 

 

our primary sources of funding include customer deposits wholesale funding liquid assets and capital if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets we actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources including short and longterm debt and secured borrowings 

 

liquidity programs 

 

we have several wholesale funding programs which are described in note 14 “shortterm borrowings” which enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning 

normally the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 

 

liquidity for keycorp 

 

the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and pay dividends to shareholders 

 

our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net shortterm cash position which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twentyfour months or less with existing liquid assets another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons we generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods 

 

typically the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national bank’s dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during 2010 keybank did not pay any dividends to the parent however nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent 25 million in dividends as of the close of business on december 31 2010 keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval to compensate for the absence of dividends the parent company has relied upon the issuance of longterm debt and stock during 2010 the parent made capital infusions of 100 million to keybank compared to 12 billion during 2009 

 

the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twentyfour months at december 31 2010 the parent company held 33 billion in shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations 

 

during 2010 the parent company issued 750 million of a fiveyear mediumterm fixedrate senior note we believe that this successful issuance demonstrates our ability to access the wholesale funding markets without an fdic guarantee additional cash flow at the parent included 602 million of maturing debt 286 million of interest and dividend payments and various other cash flows netting to a 24 million outflow 

 

our liquidity position and recent activity 

 

over the past twelve months we have increased our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals 

 

from time to time keycorp or its principal subsidiary keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity and capital requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

 

we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities during 2010 we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of shortterm investments to increase the balance of our securities availableforsale portfolio during 2009 the issuance of common shares was used to fund the reduction of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt and to increase the balance of our securities availableforsale portfolio 

 

the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings at december 31 2010 are shown in figure 35 we believe that these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009 however the availability of credit is limited and the cost of funds is higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption 

 

figure 35 reflects the credit ratings of keycorp securities at december 31 2010 if our credit ratings fall below investmentgrade that event could have a material adverse effect on us such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of 

investors and counterparties willing to lend to us ultimately credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income 

 

on april 27 2010 moody’s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities indicated that if enacted into law the financial reform bill then proposed by senator christopher dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen us banks including keybank because the legislation could weaken moody’s assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions moody’s has publicly reported that keycorp holding company ratings did not benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by moody’s keybank longterm deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to systemic support 

 

subsequently on july 27 2010 moody’s announced its review for possible downgrade of the ratings of the ten large us regional banks including keybank according to moody’s the ratings reviewed benefited from an expectation of increased government support since 2009 moody’s review considered its government support assumptions in light of the recent passage of the doddfrank act keybank longterm deposit shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated longterm debt ratings were previously identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade 

 

on november 1 2010 moody’s announced the downgrade of keybank’s shortterm borrowings senior longterm debt and subordinated debt one notch from p1 to p2 a2 to a3 and a3 to baa1 respectively in conjunction with the ratings changes moody’s upgraded their ratings outlook on the ratings from “negative” to “stable” subsequent to moody’s announcement that was publicly issued january 19 2011 moody’s indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits related to our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011 for information on the impact that moody’s action has had see note 9 “mortgage servicing assets”

credit risk management 

 

credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk 

 

credit policy approval and evaluation 

 

we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 

 

our credit risk management is responsible for credit approval is independent of our lines of business and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans only credit risk management is authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 

 

loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrower’s management the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit risk mitigants affect the expected recovery assessment 

credit risk management uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 

 

we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the strength of the borrower our legal lending limit is approximately 2 billion for any individual borrower however internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to approximately 25 of that amount as of december 31 2010 we had two client relationships with loan commitments of more than 200 million the average amount outstanding on these two individual obligor commitments was 94 million at december 31 2010 in general our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 

 

we manage industry concentrations using several methods on smaller portfolios we may set limits based on a percentage of our total loan portfolio on larger or higher risk portfolios we may establish a specific dollar commitment level or a maximum level of economic capital 

 

in addition to these precautions discussed above we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party at december 31 2010 we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of 985 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations we also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks at december 31 2010 the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was 431 million occasionally we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps these transactions with other lenders generated fee income 

 

credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value related gains or losses as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection are included in the trading income component of noninterest income these swaps decreased our operating results by 23 million for 2010 compared to a decrease of 37 million last year 

 

we also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 

 

selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure 36 the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section 

 

figure 36 selected asset quality statistics from continuing operations 

 

 

 

  

watch and criticized assets 

 

watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 

 

criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead or have led to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources such as collateral liquidation criticized assets showed significant improvement during 2010 from one year ago 

 

allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

at december 31 2010 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 16 billion or 320 of loans compared to 25 billion or 431 at december 31 2009 the allowance includes 58 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of 621 million at december 31 2010 compared to 300 million that was allocated for impaired loans of 16 billion one year ago for more information about impaired loans see note 5 “asset quality” at december 31 2010 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 15019 of nonperforming loans compared to 11587 at december 31 2009 

 

we estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” under the heading “allowance for loan and lease losses” briefly we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions changes in credit policies or underwriting standards and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets for all tdrs regardless of size as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than 25 million we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate a specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full the allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31 2010 represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 

 

as shown in figure 37 our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by 930 million or 37 during the past twelve months in general this decrease is attributed to an improved economic outlook more favorable conditions in the capital markets improvement in client income statements and continued run off in the exit loan portfolio more specifically this contraction was associated with favorable risk rating migration experienced in the loan portfolio throughout the year coupled with a decline in loans outstanding and a reduction in our general allowance which encompasses the application of historical loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics and assessment of factors such as changes in economic condition and changes in credit policies or underwriting standards 

 

both key community bank and key corporate bank showed a decline in their level of allowance during 2010 the largest declines occurred in the real estate capital and corporate banking services and national leasing lines of business these lines of business experienced the most significant improvement in the underlying credit metrics which determine the allowance our delinquency trends continued to decline during 2010 

 

our liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments decreased since 2009 by 48 million to 73 million at december 31 2010 when combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses our total allowance for credit losses represented 335 of loans at the end of 2010 compared to 452 at the end of 2009 

figure 37 allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our provision for loan and lease losses was 638 million for 2010 compared to 32 billion for 2009 our net loan chargeoffs for 2010 exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by 932 million the decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances additionally we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle and reduce exposure in our higherrisk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio marinerv financing and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans payments from borrowers or net chargeoffs as these outstanding loan balances decrease so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision 

 

net loan chargeoffs 

 

net loan chargeoffs for 2010 totaled 16 billion or 291 of average loans from continuing operations these results compare to net chargeoffs of 23 billion or 340 for the same period last year figure 38 shows the trend in our net loan chargeoffs by loan type while the composition of loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 39 

 

over the past twelve months net chargeoffs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by 673 million due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the real estate capital and corporate banking services line of business net chargeoffs for this line of business decreased 361 million from 2009 and included 131 million of net chargeoffs recorded on two specific customer relationships during the fourth quarter of 2009 as shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 453 million or 29 of total net loan chargeoffs for 2010

figure 40 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets these assets totaled 13 billion at december 31 2010 and represented 266 of portfolio loans oreo and other nonperforming assets compared to 25 billion or 425 at december 31 2009 see note 1 under the headings “impaired and other nonaccrual loans” and “allowance for loan and lease losses” for a summary of our nonaccrual and chargeoff policies 

 

figure 40 summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans from continuing operations 

 

 

 

  

as shown in figure 40 nonperforming assets decreased during 2010 having declined for the past four consecutive quarters most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and oreo in the commercial real estate line of business as shown in figure 41 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 210 million or 16 of total nonperforming assets at december 31 2010 compared to 599 million or 24 in 2009 

 

at december 31 2010 the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 60 of their original face value and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 66 of their face value at the same date oreo 

represented 52 of its original face value while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 47 of their face value 

 

at december 31 2010 our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled 306 million representing 29 of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared to 582 million representing 26 respectively in the prior year 

 

figure 41 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net chargeoffs recorded on this portfolio and the nonperforming status of these loans at these dates the exit loan portfolio represented 11 of total loans and loans held for sale at december 31 2010 as compared to 13 at december 31 2009

figure 42 shows credit exposure by industry classification in the largest sector of our loan portfolio “commercial financial and agricultural loans” since december 31 2009 total commitments and loans outstanding in this sector have decreased by 57 billion and 28 billion respectively 

 

the types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during 2010 and 2009 are summarized in figure 43 as shown in this figure nonperforming loans declined as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 as market liquidity improved

operational risk management 

 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and contractual obligations due to the passage of the doddfrank act large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk we have created and continue to create work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the doddfrank act resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance a system of internal controls and reporting 

 

we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 

 

primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business our operational risk management function manages the operational risk management program which provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the operational risk committee a senior management committee oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and independently supports the audit committee’s oversight of these controls 

 

fourth quarter results 

 

our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in figure 46 highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2010 are summarized below 

 

earnings 

 

we had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 292 million or 33 per common share compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of 258 million or 30 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

the fourth quarter 2010 results reflect an improvement in preprovision net revenue and lower credit costs from the same period oneyear ago the fourth quarter 2009 results were negatively impacted by a 756 million loan and lease loss provision fourth quarter 2010 net income attributable to key common shareholders was 279 million compared to a net loss attributable to key common shareholders of 265 million for the same quarter one year ago 

 

on an annualized basis our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 153 compared to 94 for the fourth quarter of 2009 the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 1371 for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 1260 for the yearago quarter 

 

net interest income 

 

our taxableequivalent net interest income was 635 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and the net interest margin was 331 these results compare to taxableequivalent net interest income of 637 million and a net interest margin of 304 for the fourth quarter of 2009 the increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts this benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay downs on loans 

 

noninterest income 

 

our noninterest income was 526 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 469 million for the yearago quarter investment banking and capital markets income increased 110 million compared to the same period one year ago in the fourth quarter of 2009 we incurred losses on certain real estate investments recorded additional reserves on customer derivative positions and recorded a loss on certain commercial mortgagebacked securities in total these amounted to a reduction of fee income of 87 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 this compares to income of 18 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of improved credit quality in addition net gains from loan sales increased 34 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 and a gain of 28 million was realized from the sale of tuition management systems in the fourth quarter of 2010 these gains were partially offset by decreases of 86 million in net gains losses from principal investing including results attributable to noncontrolling interests 12 million in service charges on deposit accounts and 10 million in operating lease income from the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

noninterest expense 

 

our noninterest expense was 744 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 871 million for the same period last year we recorded a credit of 26 million to the provision for losses on lendingrelated commitments during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a charge to the provision of 27 million in the yearago quarter also contributing to the decrease in noninterest expense was a decline in employee benefits expense of 41 million as a result of lower pension expense and medical claims expense additionally in the fourth quarter of 2010 operating lease expense was 22 million less and oreo expense was 15 million less than the yearago quarter 

 

provision for loan and lease losses 

 

our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of 97 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a charge of 756 million for the yearago quarter our allowance for loan and lease losses was 16 billion or 320 of total periodend loans at december 31 2010 compared to 431 at december 31 2009 

 

net loan chargeoffs for the quarter totaled 256 million or 200 of average loans these results compare to 708 million or 464 for the same period last year and 357 million or 269 for the previous quarter net loan chargeoffs declined each quarter during 2010 and are at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008 our exit loan portfolio accounted for 81 million or 32 of total net loan chargeoffs for the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

income taxes 

 

for the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a tax provision of 172 million compared to a benefit of 274 for the fourth quarter of 2009 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 337 compared with a 414 for the same quarter one year prior during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of 32 million as the result of our change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in nonus subsidiaries the tax benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily a result of a pretax loss from continuing operations

acquisitions and divestitures 

 

the information presented in note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” of the financial review section of our 2009 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference 

 

competition 

 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national 

institutions that offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation efforts continued during 2009 as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to stronger and larger financial institutions financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 140 banks that failed during 2009 representing 1709 billion in total assets were redistributed through the federal deposit insurance corporation’s “fdic” leastcost resolution process while the number of bank failures increased dramatically in 2009 from 26 in 2008 the total asset value of the 2008 bank failures represented 3736 billion in large part due to the failure of washington mutual these factors intensified the concentration of the industry and placed increased competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services 

 

the competitive landscape continued to be affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies the challenges of the liquidity crisis increased the desirability of the bank holding company structure due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity such as the discount window and other programs designed specifically for bank holding companies and certain of their affiliates the financial modernization legislation enacted in november 1999 which permits commercial bank affiliates to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions has enabled many of the more recent structural and regulatory changes these structural and regulatory changes intensified the competitive landscape within which we compete as these additional institutions now have access to low cost funding for additional information on the financial modernization legislation see the “financial modernization legislation” section of this report 

 

supervision and regulation 

 

the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the fdic and the banking system as a whole and generally is not intended for the protection of security holders 

 

below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which this discussion refers we cannot necessarily predict changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies yet such changes may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

general 

 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

 

keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because domestic deposits in keybank are insured up to applicable limits and certain deposits of keybank and debt obligations of keybank and keycorp are temporarily guaranteed up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over keybank and keycorp under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

dividend restrictions 

 

on november 14 2008 keycorp sold 25 billion of fixedrate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b the “series b preferred stock” and a warrant to purchase 35244361 common shares par value 100 the “warrant” to the united states department of the treasury the “us treasury” in conjunction with its capital purchase program the “cpp” the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on keycorp’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock keycorp will not be able to increase its dividends above the level paid in the third quarter of 2008 nor will keycorp be permitted to repurchase any of its common shares or preferred stock without the approval of the us treasury subject to the availability of certain limited exceptions  eg for purchases in connection with benefit plans the federal reserve board also advised in its february 24 2009 supervisory letter sr 0904 that recipients of cpp funds should communicate reasonably in advance with federal reserve board staff concerning how any proposed dividends capital redemptions and capital repurchases are consistent with the requirements of cpp and discouraged bank holding companies from using proceeds of the cpp to pay dividends on trust preferred securities or repay debt obligations 

 

in addition federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to keycorp by its bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval historically dividends paid to keycorp by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions during 2009 keybank did not pay any dividends to keycorp nonbank subsidiaries paid keycorp a total of 8 million in dividends as of the close of business on december 31 2009 keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a net loss of 1151 billion for 2009 and a net loss of 1161 billion for 2008 keycorp made capital infusions of 12 billion and 16 billion for 2009 and 2008 respectively into keybank in the form of cash at december 31 2009 keycorp held 35 billion in shortterm investments the funds from which can be used to pay dividends service debt and finance corporate operations 

 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic for additional information on capital guidelines see the “federal deposit insurance act — prompt corrective action” section of this report also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 

holding company structure 

 

bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions 

covered by these provisions which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates bank purchases of assets from affiliates and bank sales of assets to affiliates must be on arm’s length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for these purposes a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control while an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding company certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control and certain other companies as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when keycorp may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law defines and prescribes minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalance sheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after certain deductions by riskweighted assets 

 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity including the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses limited as a percentage of net riskweighted assets 

 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk the federal banking agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital requirements the proposed rule would enhance modeling requirements consistent with advances in risk management enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the current methodologies of the existing requirements and modify the definition of covered position to better capture positions for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate it would also impose an explicit capital requirement for incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity 

concentrations hedging and optionality the proposed rule has not yet been adopted as a final rule at december 31 2009 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased requirements including all required adjustments for market risk 

 

in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 at december 31 2009 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum leverage capital requirements 

 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2009 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratios applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary 

 

basel accords the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying activities conducted by these organizations 

 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

 

in december 2007 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the advanced approaches framework of basel ii in the us the rule was effective april 1 2008 but implementation is subject to a multiyear transition period in which limits are imposed upon the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease it does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements and explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate application of the final rule to us banking organizations is mandatory for some and optional for others currently neither keycorp nor keybank is required to apply the final rule 

 

in july 2008 the agencies issued a proposed rule for implementing the standardized approach framework of basel ii the proposal would provide an alternative approach to determining riskbased capital requirements for banking organizations that are not required to use the advanced approaches framework final rule published in december 2007 while the advanced approaches framework is mandatory for large internationally active banking organizations the standardized approach framework would be optional for others including keycorp and keybank which could also choose to remain under the basel i framework 

in december 2009 the basel committee on banking supervision published proposals to substantially revamp international capital and liquidity standards for banks this proposal includes major changes to the regulatory and leverage capital ratio calculations including a revised definition of capital a revised capital structure revised definitions of qualifying capital for tier 1 purposes revised tier 1 and tier 2 limits a new common equity to riskweighted assets measure new minimum capital ratios and certain measures to address systemic risk banks have the opportunity to submit comments on the proposal by april 16 2010 specific requirements remain undefined and therefore keycorp cannot determine what impact such measures may ultimately have on the company 

 

federal deposit insurance act 

 

deposit insurance coverage limits prior to enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 “eesa” the fdic standard maximum depositor insurance coverage limit was 100000 excluding certain retirement accounts qualifying for a maximum coverage limit of 250000 pursuant to the eesa the fdic standard maximum coverage limit had been temporarily increased to 250000 through december 31 2009 this temporary increase has been further extended to december 31 2013 by the helping families save their homes act of 2009 

 

deposit insurance assessments substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic accordingly keybank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic under current law the fdic is required to maintain the dif reserve ratio within the range of 115 to 150 of estimated insured deposits because the dif reserve ratio fell and was expected to remain below 115 the fdia required the fdic to establish and implement a restoration plan to restore the dif reserve ratio to at least 115 within eight years absent extraordinary circumstances consequently and depending upon an institution’s risk category for the first quarter of 2009 annualized deposit insurance assessments ranged from 12 to 50 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits as compared with 05 to 43 throughout 2008 moreover under a new riskbased assessment system implemented in the second quarter of 2009 annualized deposit insurance assessments range from 07 to 775 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category on may 22 2009 the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus tier 1 capital as of june 30 2009 not to exceed 10 basis points times the institution’s assessment base as of june 30 2009 this special assessment was collected on september 30 2009 on november 12 2009 the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay on december 30 2009 their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 2011 and 2012 the amount of keybank’s fdic assessment prepayment was 539 million which we paid on december 30 2009 

 

fico assessments since 1997 all fdicinsured depository institutions have been required through assessments collected by the fdic to service the annual interest on 30year noncallable bonds issued by the financing corporation “fico” in the late 1980s to fund losses incurred by the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation fico assessments are separate from and in addition to deposit insurance assessments are adjusted quarterly and unlike deposit insurance assessments are assessed uniformly without regard to an institution’s risk category throughout 2009 the annualized fico assessment rate ranged from 0102 to 0114 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits 

 

temporary liquidity guarantee program in october 2008 the fdic with the written concurrence of the federal reserve board made a systemic risk recommendation to the secretary of the treasury who in consultation with the president determined that the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution provision under the fdia should be invoked to enable the fdic to establish the temporary liquidity guarantee program the “tlgp” 

 

the tlgp regulation permitted the fdic to temporarily guarantee the unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities the “debt guarantee” as well as all depositor funds in qualifying noninterestbearing transaction accounts maintained at participating fdicinsured depository institutions the “transaction account guarantee” for fdicguaranteed debt issued before april 1 2009 the debt guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or june 30 2012 for fdicguaranteed debt issued on or after april 1 2009 the debt guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or december 31 2012 unless a participating institution elected to optout the transaction account guarantee expires on june 30 2010 

participants in the tlgp are subject to certain assessments by the fdic assessments on participants under the debt guarantee part of the tlgp are computed by multiplying the amount of their fdicguaranteed debt by annualized rates that depending on the type of issuer entity as well as the issuance and maturity dates of such debt range from 50 to 110 basis points surcharges on these assessments ranging from 10 to 50 basis points depending on the issuance and maturity dates of the debt are also prescribed in addition participants under the debt guarantee part of the tlgp that have elected to have flexibility before exceeding their fdicguaranteed debt limit to issue certain senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the fdic are assessed an additional onetime nonrefundable fee of 375 basis points assessments on participants under the transaction account guarantee part of the tlgp are computed by multiplying qualifying noninterestbearing transaction account balances in excess of 250000 by an annualized ten basis point rate prior to january 1 2010 and a 15 20 or 25 basis point rate depending on the institution’s risk category on and after january 1 2010 until june 30 2010 moreover to the extent that participant assessments are insufficient to cover the expenses or losses to the dif arising from the tlgp the fdia requires the fdic to impose one or more special assessments on fdicinsured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies 

 

keycorp is a participant in the debt guarantee component of the tlgp keybank is a participant in both the transaction account guarantee and the debt guarantee components of the tlgp including the special election to issue longterm senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the fdic as of december 31 2009 keycorp had 9375 million of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp and keybank had 10 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution generally is liable to the fdic for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any such commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

 

conservatorship and receivership of institutions if any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the fdic is appointed its conservator or receiver the fdic may under federal law disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by its holder against the receivership or conservatorship the amount paid upon such claim would depend upon among other factors the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and its priority relative to the priority of others in addition the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for termination default acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution the fdic as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors 

 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of the institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on 

the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities determination of riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and action upon regulatory applications 

 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination and is not well capitalized an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or its parent bank holding company and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank holding company keybank is wellcapitalized pursuant to the prompt corrective action guidelines 

 

financial modernization legislation 

 

the provisions of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glasssteagall act to permit commercial banks among other things to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba keycorp has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies acquire its victory capital advisers inc subsidiary operate its keybanc capital markets inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and establish financial subsidiaries to engage more efficiently in certain activities 

 

in order for a company to maintain its status as a financial holding company under the glba its depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized as defined under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia and well managed as determined by the depository institution’s primary regulator if any of the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company fail to satisfy these criteria the holding company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board setting forth a plan to correct the deficiencies if these deficiencies are not corrected within a 180day period the federal reserve board may order the financial holding company to divest its depository institution subsidiaries alternatively the holding company could retain its depository institution subsidiaries but would have to cease engaging in any activities that are permissible under the glba but were not permissible for a bank holding company prior to the enactment of that statute in addition if a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a less than satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the holding company will not be permitted to commence new activities or make new acquisitions in reliance on the glba until the cra rating of the subsidiary improves to being at least satisfactory 

entry into certain covenants 

 

keycorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and one transaction with an overallotment option in 2008 each of which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities “trust preferred securities” by delaware statutory trusts formed by keycorp the “trusts” as further described below simultaneously with the closing of each of those transactions keycorp entered into a socalled replacement capital covenant each a “replacement capital covenant” and collectively the “replacement capital covenants” for the benefit of persons that buy or hold specified series of longterm indebtedness of keycorp or its then largest depository institution keybank the “covered debt” each of the replacement capital covenants provide that neither keycorp nor any of its subsidiaries including any of the trusts will redeem or purchase all or any part of the trust preferred securities or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by keycorp and held by the trust the “junior subordinated debentures” as applicable on or before the date specified in the applicable replacement capital covenant with certain limited exceptions except to the extent that during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or purchase keycorp has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that i have equitylike characteristics that are the same as or more equitylike than the applicable characteristics of the trust preferred securities or the junior subordinated debentures as applicable at the time of redemption or purchase and ii keycorp has obtained the prior approval of the federal reserve board if such approval is then required by the federal reserve board keycorp will provide a copy of the replacement capital covenants to respective holders of covered debt upon request made in writing to keycorp investor relations 127 public square mail code oh01271113 cleveland oh 441141306

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

an investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent to our business ownership of our equity securities and our industry described below are certain risks and uncertainties the occurrence of which could have a material and adverse effect on keycorp before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations andor access to liquidity andor credit could be materially and adversely affected “material adverse effect on us” if this were to happen the value of our securities — common shares series a preferred stock series b preferred stock and our trust preferred securities — could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

 

risks related to our business 

 

certain industries including the financial services industry are more significantly affected by certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values should the improvement of these economic factors lag the improvement of the overall economy or not occur we could be adversely affected 

 

should the stabilization of the us economy lead to a general economic recovery the improvement of certain economic factors such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall economy or not occur at all these economic factors typically affect certain industries such as real estate and financial services more significantly for example improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months our clients include entities active in these industries furthermore financial services companies with a substantial lending business like ours are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time it could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to market risks including in the commercial real estate sector should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector remain weak under continuing pressure by reduced asset values rising vacancies and reduced rents commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of 2007 after gaining approximately 30 since 2005 and 90 since 2001 according to moody’s real estate analytics llc commercial property index at november 30 2009 commercial real estate values were down 43 from their peak many of our commercial real estate loans were originated between 2005 and 2007 a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans these properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments weak economic conditions typically slow the execution of new leases such conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover as a result of these factors vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space are expected to continue to rise in 2010 increased vacancies could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters the combination of these factors could result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market should these fundamentals continue to deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income it could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

declining asset prices could adversely affect us 

 

over the last six quarters the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets have experienced reached extreme levels the market dislocations led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by 

other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable this could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to credit risk 

 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor further weakening of economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 

 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 71 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so however our loan portfolio still contains a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances 

 

we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmentalrelated covenants which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law we take steps to mitigate risks however should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants our credit quality could be adversely affected 

 

the deterioration of one or more of any of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the credit ratings of keycorp and keybank are important in order to maintain liquidity 

 

although keycorp’s and keybank’s longterm debt is currently rated investmentgrade by the major rating agencies the ratings of key’s longterm debt series a preferred stock and certain of its other securities have been downgraded andor put on negative outlook by those major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank and their ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including key’s financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of which are not entirely within key’s control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry the financial markets and the economy there can be no assurance that key will maintain its current ratings 

 

if the securities of keycorp andor keybank suffer additional ratings downgrades such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase key’s cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to key thereby curtailing its business operations and reducing its ability to generate income further downgrades of the credit ratings of key’s securities particularly if they are below investmentgrade could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

there can be no assurance that the eesa the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government to restore liquidity and stability to the us financial system will help stabilize the us financial system 

 

the eesa was enacted and signed into law by president bush in october 2008 in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions pursuant to the eesa the us treasury has authority to among other things purchase up to 

700 billion of mortgages mortgagebacked securities preferred equity and warrants and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets under its authority provided by eesa the us treasury established the cpp and the core provisions of the financial stability plan there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the eesa the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “recovery bill” or other programs and initiatives undertaken by the us government will have on the financial markets the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability experienced in late 2008 and through the third quarter of 2009 may return or persist regional financial institutions have faced difficulties issuing debt in the fixedincome debt markets these conditions could return and pose continued difficulties for the issuance of both medium term note and longterm subordinated note issuances the failure of the eesa or other government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the us economy on a path for an economic recovery could result in a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on us in the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets continue or as the case may be return or become exacerbated there may be a material adverse effect on us from 1 continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets 2 continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically 3 limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system or 4 recessionary conditions that return are deeper or last longer than currently anticipated 

 

the us treasury may require us to raise additional capital that would likely be dilutive to our common shares 

 

in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 we reported that under the us treasury’s capital assessment program “cap” we were required to participate in the supervisory capital assessment program “scap” to determine whether we would be required to raise additional capital as announced on may 7 2009 under the scap assessment we were required to increase the amount of our tier 1 common equity by 18 billion within six months we generated in excess of the 18 billion of additional tier 1 common equity required by the scap results nevertheless there can be no assurance that our regulators including the us treasury and the federal reserve board will not conduct additional “stress test” capital assessments outside of typical examination cycles such as the scap andor require us to generate additional capital including tier 1 common equity in the future in the event of further negative economic circumstances or in order for us to redeem our series b preferred stock held by the us treasury under the cpp any additional capital that keycorp generates in the future whether through exchange offers underwritten offerings of common shares or other public or private transactions would be dilutive to common shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common shares these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the potential issuance of a significant amount of common shares or equity convertible into our common shares to a private investor or group of private investors may be dilutive and cause the market price of our common shares to decline 

 

having a significant shareholder may make some future transactions more difficult or perhaps impossible to complete without the support of such shareholder the interests of the significant shareholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders there can be no assurance that any significant shareholder will exercise its influence in our best interests as opposed to its best interests as a significant shareholder a significant shareholder may make it difficult to approve certain transactions even if they are supported by the other shareholders which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

issuing a significant amount of common equity to a private investor may result in a change in control of keycorp under regulatory standards and contractual terms 

 

should keycorp obtain a significant amount of additional capital from any individual private investor a change of control could occur under applicable regulatory standards and contractual terms such change of control may trigger notice approval andor other regulatory requirements in many states and jurisdictions in which we operate we are a party to various contracts and other agreements that may require us to obtain consents from our respective contract counterparties in the event of a change in control the failure to obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals or contractual consents due to a change in control may have a material adverse effect on us 

should we decide to repurchase the us treasury’s series b preferred stock future issuances of common shares may be necessary which if necessary would likely result in significant dilution to holders of keycorp common shares 

 

in conjunction with any repurchase of the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury we may elect or be required by our regulators to increase the amount of our tier 1 common equity through the sale of additional common shares in addition in connection with the us treasury’s purchase of the series b preferred stock pursuant to a letter agreement dated november 14 2008 and the securities purchase agreement — standard terms the us treasury received a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an initial per share exercise price of 1064 subject to adjustment which expires ten years from the issuance date and we have agreed to provide the us treasury with registration rights covering the warrant and the underlying common shares the terms of the warrant provide for a procedure upon repurchase of the series b preferred stock to determine the value of the warrant and purchase the warrant within approximately 40 days of the repurchase of the series b preferred stock however even if we were to redeem the series b preferred stock there is no assurance that this warrant will be fully retired and therefore that it will not be exercised prior to its expiration date the issuance of additional common shares as a result of the exercise of the warrant the us treasury holds would likely dilute the ownership interest of keycorp’s existing common shareholders 

 

the terms of the warrant provide that if we issue common shares or securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable for common shares at a price that is less than 90 of the market price of such shares on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement to sell such shares the number and the per share price of common shares to be purchased pursuant to the warrant will be adjusted pursuant to its terms we may also choose to issue securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares and such securities may themselves contain antidilution provisions such antidilution adjustment provisions may have a further dilutive effect on other holders of our common shares 

 

there can be no assurance that we will not in the future determine that it is advisable or that we will not encounter circumstances where we determine that it is necessary to issue additional common shares securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or commonequivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital the market price of our common shares could decline as a result of such exchange offerings as well as other sales of a large block of our common shares or similar securities in the market thereafter or the perception that such sales could occur these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we may not be permitted to repurchase the us treasury’s tarp cpp investment if and when we request approval to do so 

 

we have generated in excess of the 18 billion in additional tier 1 common equity required by the scap while it is our plan to repurchase the series b preferred stock as soon as practicable in order to repurchase such securities in whole or in part we must establish to our regulators satisfaction that we have satisfied all of the conditions to repurchase and must obtain the approval of the federal reserve and the us treasury there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase the us treasury’s tarp investment in our series b preferred stock in addition to limiting our ability to return capital to our shareholders the us treasury’s investment could limit our ability to retain key executives and other key employees and limit our ability to develop business opportunities these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

during 2009 disruptions and volatility in financial markets adversely affected keycorp these factors could continue to affect keycorp our actions in response to these financial market disruptions may not be sufficient to mitigate the effects of market uncertainties and other risks presented 

 

the capital and credit markets including the fixed income markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption between july 2007 and october 2009 the disruptions in the capital and credit markets reached unprecedented levels during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as a result of the severe economic conditions in 2009 we and many financial institutions similar to us generated and raised tier 1 common equity through exchanges of existing trust preferred securities or preferred equity for common stock atthemarket offerings of common stock or underwritten offerings of common stock or a combination of the foregoing until the middle of the third quarter of 2009 regional financial institutions continued to encounter difficulties in the fixed income markets 

while most economists generally agree that the us economy has stabilized it remains unclear whether a sustainable recovery is underway uncertainties in the financial markets continue to present significant challenges particularly for the financial services industry as a financial services company our operations and financial condition are significantly affected by general economic and market conditions during 2009 the continued disruptions in the financial markets caused markdowns andor losses by financial institutions from trading hedging and other market activities resulting in reduced earnings for many financial institutions additionally financial institutions with lending operations faced substantial loan losses due to high unemployment reduced real estate asset values and 143 million bankruptcy filings in 2009 representing an increase of 32 from 2008 unemployment at december 31 2009 was above 10 up from 74 at december 31 2008 we were similarly affected by these factors during 2009 we increased our provision for loan losses by 1622 billion or 106 in response to the continued deterioration in our loan portfolios resulting from the economic decline during 2009 we also recorded noncash accounting charges of 268 million due to intangible assets impairment resulting from a decline in the fair value of our national banking unit reflecting the extreme weakness in financial markets and our decisions to wind down the operations of austin capital management ltd “austin” and cease conducting our business in the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets it is difficult to predict how long these challenging economic conditions will exist which of our markets products or other businesses will ultimately be affected and whether our actions will effectively mitigate these extreme external factors furthermore the models that we use to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure may become less predictive due to fundamental changes in the us economy accordingly these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk 

 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve board changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings we use simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet changes customer behavior new products new business volume product pricing competitor behavior the behavior of market interest rates and anticipated hedging activities simulation analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future risks and trends accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes actual hedging strategies employed changes in balance sheet composition and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events 

 

although we believe we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to other market risk 

 

traditionally market factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates changes in the equity markets and changes in the financial soundness of bond insurers sureties and other unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect current market values of financial instruments during 2008 market events demonstrated this to an extreme between july 2007 and october 2009 conditions in the fixed income markets specifically the wider credit spreads 

over benchmark us treasury securities for many fixed income securities caused significant volatility in the market values of loans securities and certain other financial instruments that are held in our trading or heldforsale portfolios opportunities to minimize the adverse affects of market changes are not always available it is possible that such volatility and adverse effects will continue over a prolonged period of time andor worsen over time it is not possible for us to predict whether there will be further substantial changes in the financial markets that could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 

 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services to institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients during 2008 key incurred 54 million of derivativerelated charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of lehman brothers another example of losses related to this type of risk is the losses associated with the bernie madoff ponzi scheme “madoff ponzi scheme” as a result of the madoff ponzi scheme our investment subsidiary austin determined that its funds had suffered investment losses up to 186 million following lehman brothers failure we took several steps to better measure monitor and mitigate our counterparty risks and to reduce these exposures this includes daily position measurement and reporting the use of scenario analysis and stress testing replacement cost estimation risk mitigation strategies and market feedback validation 

 

defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us it is not possible to anticipate all of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks completely accordingly there is no assurance that losses from such risks would not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to liquidity risk 

 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2009 these conditions in the recent past increase our liquidity risk exposure and could return while the credit markets have improved the availability of credit and the cost of funds remain tight and more expensive than typical for an economy with a growing gross domestic product part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth exiting certain noncore lending businesses diversifying our funding base maintaining a liquid asset portfolio and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity many of these disrupted markets are showing signs of recovery nonetheless if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time we may need to expand the utilization of unsecured wholesale funding instruments or use other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets — domestic european and canadian — as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools there can 

be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available under certain stressed conditions experienced during the liquidity crisis some of these alternative means of funding were not available should these forms of funding become unavailable it is unclear what impact given current economic conditions unavailability of such funding would have on us a deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan losses to increase 

 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  ie  if the loan allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses should they become necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to operational risk 

 

like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the affect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located — the northwest the rocky mountains the great lakes and the northeast — as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the nonowneroccupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in several markets outside of our footprint real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions certain markets such as florida southern california phoenix arizona and las vegas nevada have experienced more significant deterioration the delinquencies nonperforming loans and chargeoffs that we have experienced have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets as a result of these and other economic factors we recently increased the provision for loan losses the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand 

for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession an act of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real estate could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in recent years while the breadth of the institutions that we compete with has increased competition has intensified as a result of consolidation efforts during 2009 competition continued to intensify as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to further redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to stronger and larger financial institutions we expect this trend to continue the competitive landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies during the liquidity crisis due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity the financial services industry’s competitive landscape could become even more intensified as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 

  

failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes it is likely that there will be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions’ regulatory regime in light of recent events affecting the financial services industry it is not possible to predict the scope of such changes or their potential impact on our results of operations 

 

for example president obama announced in january 2010 a reform proposal to 1 limit the scope of financial institutions and ensure that a bank will not own invest in or sponsor a hedge fund or a private equity fund or have proprietary trading operations unrelated to its service of its customers for its own profit and 2 limit further consolidation of the financial sector this proposal — sometimes referred to by the media as the volcker rule — 

aims to place limits on the growth of market share at the largest financial firms supplementing the existing caps on market share of deposits it is impossible to predict whether president obama’s proposal for financial regulatory reform will succeed or what the impact of any financial reform proposal would be on us or the banking industry generally if this financial reform proposal is adopted in some form it may for example limit the scope of financial services and investments that financial institutions with commercial banks may invest in impose additional capital and liquidity standards andor limit the size of financial institutions in order to avoid any moral hazard associated with financial institutions deemed to big to fail these types of reform could limit our ability to conduct certain of our businesses such as funds that are part of our investment adviser subsidiary victory capital management inc or funds sponsored and advised by and investments in private equity funds made by our principal investing line of business which could require us to divest or spinoff certain of our business units and private equity investments furthermore as part of the scap key was identified as a financial institution that was one of nineteen firms that collectively hold twothirds of the banking assets and more than onehalf of the loans in the us banking system while it is difficult to predict if regulatory reform will occur and the extent or nature of regulatory reform should regulatory reform limit the size of the scap banks our ability to pursue opportunities to achieve growth through the acquisition of other banks or deposits could be affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on us such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

 

we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

 

keycorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries with the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to keycorp during 2008 and 2009 keybank did not pay any dividends to keycorp nonbank subsidiaries paid keycorp 8 million in dividends during 2009 as of the close of business on december 31 2009 keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a net loss of 1151 billion for 2009 and a net loss of 1161 billion for 2008 for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see “supervision and regulation — dividend restrictions” of this report 

 

also keycorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to keycorp we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on us 

our earnings andor financial condition may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws or the interpretation of them 

 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on us although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

 

like all businesses we are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

additionally we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred tax assets the carrying value of these assets is dependent upon earnings forecasts and prior period earnings among other things a significant change in our assumptions could affect the carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 

  

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want andor need in order to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position our performance including our competitive position could suffer and in turn have a material adverse effect on us although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees and have incentive compensation 

plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse effect on us because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel for our talented executives andor relationship managers 

 

pursuant to the standardized terms of the cpp among other things we agreed to institute certain restrictions on the compensation of certain senior executive management positions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified senior executives other restrictions may also be imposed under the recovery bill or other legislation or regulations our ability to attract andor retain talented executives andor relationship managers may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if any does occur that it will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we continually encounter technological change 

 

the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

 

from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment of the claims whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any reputation damage from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on us 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

risks associated with our common shares 

 

our issuance of securities to the us treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares if we are unable to redeem such preferred shares the dividend rate increases substantially after five years 

 

in connection with our sale of 25 billion of the series b preferred stock to the us treasury in conjunction with its cpp we also issued a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an exercise price of 1064 the number of shares was determined based upon the requirements of the cpp and was calculated based on the average market price of our common shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval of our issuance which was also the basis for the exercise price of 1064 the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock we will not be able to increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend declared during the third quarter of 2008 01875 per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our common shares or preferred stock without among other things us treasury approval or the availability of certain limited exceptions  eg  purchases in connection with our benefit plans furthermore as long as the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions these restrictions combined with the dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and as a result they could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

unless we are able to redeem the series b preferred stock during the first five years the dividend payments on this capital will increase substantially at that point from 5 125 million annually to 9 225 million annually depending on market conditions at the time this increase in dividends could significantly impact our liquidity and as a result have a material adverse effect on us 

 

you may not receive dividends on the common shares 

 

holders of our common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments furthermore our common shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding as of february 24 2010 there were 2904839 shares of keycorp’s series a preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 100 per share issued and outstanding and 25000 shares of the series b preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 100000 per share issued and outstanding 

 

in july 2009 we reduced the quarterly dividend on our common shares to 001 per share we do not expect to increase the quarterly dividend above 001 for the foreseeable future we could decide to eliminate our common shares dividend altogether furthermore as long as our series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock are outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions in addition prior to november 14 2011 unless we have redeemed all of the series b preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of the series b preferred stock to third parties the consent of the us treasury will be required for us to among other things increase our common shares dividend above 1875 except in limited circumstances this could adversely affect the market price of our common shares also keycorp is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal 

regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve board regarding capital adequacy and dividends 

 

in addition terms of keybank’s outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on keycorp’s capital stock including its common shares or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture if we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

keycorp was required to conduct stress tests pursuant to the us treasury’s cap and could be required to conduct additional stress tests and raise additional capital that would be dilutive to our common shares and may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders 

 

on february 25 2009 the us treasury announced preliminary details of the cap component of its financial stability plan the cap was implemented to ensure the continued ability of us financial institutions to lend to creditworthy borrowers in the event of a weaker than expected economic environment and larger than expected potential losses following the conduct of such stress tests our regulators determined that we needed to generate an additional 18 billion of tier 1 common equity 

 

we completed various capital transactions generating in excess of 18 billion of additional tier 1 common equity should the us treasury and our banking regulators determine that additional stress testing is necessary or in order to receive approval to redeem our series b preferred we may need to raise additional capital should this happen we may only have a limited window to raise that capital should we need to issue additional equity capital it would be dilutive to our common shares and may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders these factors may have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our share price can be volatile 

 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common shares when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

 23 

 

  

general market fluctuations market disruption industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

 

our common shares are not a bank deposit and therefore are not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

risks associated with our industry 

 

difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry business and results of operations 

 

the dramatic deterioration experienced in the housing market led to weakness across geographies industries and ultimately the broad economy over the last 30 months the housing market experienced falling home prices increasing foreclosures unemployment and underemployment rose significantly and weakened commercial real estate fundamentals negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and commercial and investment banks the resulting writedowns to assets of financial institutions have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital to merge with larger and stronger institutions and in some cases to seek government assistance or bankruptcy protection it is not possible to predict how long these economic conditions will exist which of our markets products or other businesses will ultimately be affected and whether our actions and government remediation efforts will effectively mitigate these factors accordingly the resulting lack of available credit lack of confidence in the financial sector decreased consumer confidence increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse effect on us furthermore continued deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

as a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions we may face the following risks including but not limited to 

 

 24 

 

  

financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 

 

technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on us

acquisitions and divestitures 

 

the information presented in note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” on page 87 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference 

 

competition 

 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies 

investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry placing added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services consolidation efforts intensified during 2008 as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to stronger and larger financial institutions financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 26 banks that failed during 2008 were redistributed through the federal deposit insurance corporation’s “fdic” leastcost resolution process these factors intensified the concentration of the industry and placed increased competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services 

 

the competitive landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies the challenges of the liquidity crisis increased the desirability of the bank holding company structure due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity such as the discount window and other programs designed specifically for bank holding companies and certain of their affiliates the financial modernization legislation enacted in november 1999 which permits commercial bank affiliates to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions has enabled many of the more recent structural and regulatory changes these structural and regulatory changes intensified the competitive landscape within which key competes since additional institutions now have access to low cost funding for additional information on the financial modernization legislation see “financial modernization legislation” on page 9 of this report 

 

supervision and regulation 

 

the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the fdic and the banking system as a whole and generally is not intended for the protection of security holders 

 

set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which this discussion refers changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

general 

 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities 

 

keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because domestic deposits in keybank are insured up to applicable limits and certain deposits of keybank and debt obligations of keybank and keycorp are temporarily guaranteed up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over keybank and keycorp under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

dividend restrictions 

 

on november 14 2008 keycorp sold 25 billion of fixedrate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b the “series b preferred stock” and a warrant to purchase 35244361 common shares par value 100 the “common shares” to the united states department of the treasury the “us treasury” in conjunction with its capital purchase program the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on keycorp’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock keycorp will not be able to increase its dividends above the level paid in the third quarter of 2008 nor will keycorp be permitted to repurchase any of its common shares or preferred stock without the approval of the us treasury subject to the availability of certain limited exceptions  eg for purchases in connection with benefit plans the federal reserve board also advised in its february 24 2009 supervisory letter sr 0904 that recipients of cpp funds should communicate reasonably in advance with federal reserve board staff concerning how any proposed dividends capital redemptions and capital repurchases are consistent with the requirements of cpp and discouraged bank holding companies from using proceeds of the cpp to pay dividends on trust preferred securities or repay debt obligations 

 

in addition various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to keycorp by its bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval historically dividends paid to keycorp by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions during 2008 keybank did not pay any dividends to keycorp nonbank subsidiaries paid keycorp a total of 113234 in dividends as of the close of business on december 31 2008 keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a net loss of 1161 billion for 2008 during 2008 keycorp made capital infusions of 16 billion into keybank in the form of cash at december 31 2008 keycorp held 4756 billion in shortterm investments the funds from which can be used to pay dividends service debt and finance corporate operations 

 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic see “federal deposit insurance act — prompt corrective action” beginning on page 8 also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 

 

on february 13 2009 the house of representatives and the senate passed the economic stimulus bill known as the “american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009” president obama signed the bill into law on tuesday february 17 2009 the bill contains provisions that will affect institutions that received or will receive financial 

assistance under the capital purchase program keycorp is currently reviewing the requirements and will make any necessary revisions to its policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable law 

 

holding company structure 

 

bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates bank purchases of assets from affiliates and bank sales of assets to affiliates must be on arm’s length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for these purposes a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control while an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding company certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control and certain other companies as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc any of the victory mutual funds most of the austin capital funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when keycorp may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law defines and prescribes minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalance sheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after certain deductions by riskweighted assets 

 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity including the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk the federal banking agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital 

requirements the proposed rule would enhance modeling requirements consistent with advances in risk management enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the current methodologies of the existing requirements and modify the definition of covered position to better capture positions for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate it would also impose an explicit capital requirement for incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity concentrations hedging and optionality the proposed rule has not yet been adopted as a final rule at december 31 2008 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased requirements including all required adjustments for market risk 

 

in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 at december 31 2008 key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum leverage capital requirements 

 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2008 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary 

 

basel accords the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying activities conducted by these organizations 

 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

 

in december 2007 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the advanced approaches framework of basel ii in the us the rule was effective april 1 2008 but implementation is subject to a multiyear transition period in which limits are imposed upon the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease it does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements and explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate application of the final rule to us banking organizations is mandatory for some and optional for others currently neither keycorp nor keybank is required to apply the final rule 

 

in july 2008 the agencies issued a proposed rule for implementing the standardized approach framework of basel ii the proposal would provide an alternative approach to determining riskbased capital requirements for banking organizations that are not required to use the advanced approaches framework final rule published in 

december 2007 while the advanced approaches framework is mandatory for large internationally active banking organizations the standardized approach framework would be optional for others including keycorp and keybank which could also choose to remain under the basel i framework 

 

federal deposit insurance act 

 

deposit insurance coverage limits prior to enactment of the eesa the fdic standard maximum depositor insurance coverage limit was 100000 excluding certain retirement accounts qualifying for a maximum coverage limit of 250000 pursuant to the eesa the fdic standard maximum coverage limit has been temporarily increased to 250000 through december 31 2009 as provided in the eesa this temporary standard maximum coverage limit increase expires on january 1 2010 and is not to be taken into account by the fdic for purposes of setting deposit insurance assessments 

 

deposit insurance assessments substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic accordingly keybank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic under current law the fdic is required to maintain the dif reserve ratio within the range of 115 to 150 of estimated insured deposits because the dif reserve ratio fell and was expected to remain below 115 the fdia required the fdic to establish and implement a restoration plan to restore the dif reserve ratio to at least 115 within five years absent extraordinary circumstances the fdic has invoked the extraordinary circumstances provision under the fdia to allow the restoration plan for the dif to be extended to seven years consequently and depending upon an institution’s risk category for the first quarter of 2009 annualized deposit insurance assessments will range from 12 to 50 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits as compared with 05 to 43 throughout 2008 on february 27 2009 the fdic board of directors approved an emergency special assessment of 20 basis points on all insured depository institutions on june 30 2009 to be collected on september 30 2009 the interim rule would also allow the fdic board to impose an emergency special assessment of 10 basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence moreover under a new riskbased assessment system that is to be implemented in the second quarter of 2009 annualized deposit insurance assessments would range from 07 to 775 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category at december 31 2008 the unused portion of the onetime premium assessment credit available to key under deposit insurance reform legislation enacted in 2006 was approximately 39 million the remainder of key’s onetime premium assessment credit is expected to be utilized during the first quarter of 2009 

 

fico assessments since 1997 all fdicinsured depository institutions have been required through assessments collected by the fdic to service the annual interest on 30year noncallable bonds issued by the financing corporation “fico” in the late 1980s to fund losses incurred by the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation fico assessments are separate from and in addition to deposit insurance assessments are adjusted quarterly and unlike deposit insurance assessments are assessed uniformly without regard to an institution’s risk category throughout 2008 the annualized fico assessment rate ranged from 011 to 014 for each 100 of assessable domestic deposits 

 

temporary liquidity guarantee program in october 2008 the fdic with the written concurrence of the federal reserve board made a systemic risk recommendation to the secretary of the treasury who in consultation with the president determined that the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution provision under the fdia should be invoked consequently and in order to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions and financial stability the fdic established and by final regulation implemented its temporary liquidity guarantee program the “tlgp” 

 

under the tlgp regulation the fdic will temporarily guarantee the unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating eligible entities the “debt guarantee” as well as all depositor funds in qualifying noninterestbearing transaction accounts maintained at participating fdicinsured depository institutions the “transaction account guarantee” for fdicguaranteed debt issued on or before june 30 2009 the debt guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or june 30 2012 the transaction account guarantee expires on january 1 2010 the us treasury in conjunction with other banking regulators has announced an intention to extend the tlgp as part of its financial stability plan details as to how the extension through october 31 2009 would be implemented have not been announced 

participants in the tlgp are subject to certain assessments by the fdic assessments on participants under the debt guarantee part of the tlgp are computed by multiplying the amount of their fdicguaranteed debt by annualized rates which depending on the type of issuer entity and the maturity of such debt range from 50 to 110 basis points in addition participants under the debt guarantee part of the tlgp that have elected to have flexibility before exceeding their fdicguaranteed debt limit to issue senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the fdic and maturing beyond june 30 2012 are assessed an additional onetime nonrefundable fee such fee is computed by multiplying the participant’s qualifying senior unsecured debt outstanding as of september 30 2008 and maturing no later than june 30 2009 or if no such debt was outstanding as of september 30 2008 then the amount of the participant’s fdicguaranteed debt limit by 375 basis points assessments on participants under the transaction account guarantee part of the tlgp are computed by multiplying qualifying noninterestbearing transaction account balances in excess of 250000 by an annualized 10 basis point rate moreover to the extent that participant assessments are insufficient to cover the expenses or losses to dif arising from the tlgp the fdia requires the fdic to impose one or more emergency special assessments on all fdicinsured depository institutions each such special assessment will be computed with reference to the amount by which an insured depository institution’s average total assets exceed the sum of the institution’s average total tangible equity and average total subordinated debt 

 

keycorp is a participant in the debt guarantee component of the tlgp keybank is a participant in both the transaction account guarantee and the debt guarantee components of the tlgp including the special election to issue longterm senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the fdic as of december 31 2008 keycorp had 500 million of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp and keybank had 10 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the tlgp 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution generally is liable to the fdic for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any such commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

 

conservatorship and receivership of institutions if any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the fdic is appointed its conservator or receiver the fdic may under federal law disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by its holder against the receivership or conservatorship the amount paid upon such claim would depend upon among other factors the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and its priority relative to the priority of others in addition the fdic as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for termination default acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution the fdic as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors 

 

leastcost resolution in attempting to resolve the problems of an insured institution in default or in danger of default in general the fdic is required to satisfy the institution’s obligations to insured depositors at the least cost to dif and not to take any action that would have the effect of increasing the losses to dif by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of deposits or by protecting creditors other than depositors 

 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured 

depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment 

 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of the institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities determination of riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and action upon regulatory applications 

 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination and is not well capitalized an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or its parent bank holding company and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank holding company keybank is wellcapitalized pursuant to the prompt corrective action guidelines 

 

financial modernization legislation 

 

the provisions of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glasssteagall act to permit commercial banks among other things to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba keycorp has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies acquire its victory capital advisers inc subsidiary operate its keybanc capital markets inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and establish financial subsidiaries to engage more efficiently in certain activities 

 

in order for a company to maintain its status as a financial holding company under the glba its depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized as defined under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia and well managed as determined by the depository institution’s primary regulator if any of the depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding company fail to satisfy these criteria the holding company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board setting forth a plan to correct the deficiencies if these deficiencies are not corrected within a 180day period the federal reserve board may order the financial holding company to divest its depository institution subsidiaries alternatively the holding company could retain its depository institution subsidiaries but would have to cease engaging in any activities that are permissible under the glba but were not permissible for a bank holding company prior to the enactment of that statute in addition if a depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a less than satisfactory rating under the 

community reinvestment act “cra” the holding company will not be permitted to commence new activities or make new acquisitions in reliance on the glba until the cra rating of the subsidiary improves to being at least satisfactory 

 

the glba also established new privacy protections for customers of financial institutions under federal law a financial institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describe the conditions under which the financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provide an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties

fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 

 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 the “fact act” imposes new requirements on financial institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit bureaus the fact act also allows customers to choose to optout of having certain information shared across a financial institution’s affiliates for marketing solicitation purposes final regulations were issued in 2007 concerning the details of this marketing optout key implemented a marketing use optout three years ago which key believes satisfies the material requirements of this optout rule in addition on october 31 2007 the federal financial regulatory agencies together issued final regulations the “red flag guidelines” implementing sections 114 and 315 of the fact act the red flag guidelines require key to develop and implement an identify theft protection program for covered accounts the identity theft program was in place by the required november 1 2008 deadline compliance with the red flag guidelines requires key to have a formal program in place that identifies threats assesses risk prioritizes gaps remediates high risk gaps and provides board level reporting key believes that it has implemented an identity theft program as required by the red flag guidelines and achieved regulatory requirements 

 

entry into certain covenants 

 

keycorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and one transaction with an overallotment option in 2008 each of which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities “trust preferred securities” by delaware statutory trusts formed by keycorp the “trusts” as further described below simultaneously with the closing of each of those transactions keycorp entered into a replacement capital covenant each a “replacement capital covenant” and collectively the “replacement capital covenants” for the benefit of persons that buy or hold specified series of longterm indebtedness of keycorp or its then largest depository institution currently keybank the “covered debt” each of the replacement capital covenants provide that neither keycorp nor any of its subsidiaries including any of the trusts will redeem or purchase all or any part of the trust preferred securities or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by keycorp and held by the trust the “junior subordinated debentures” as applicable on or before the date specified in the applicable replacement capital covenant with certain limited exceptions except to the extent that during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or purchase keycorp has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that i have equitylike characteristics that are the same as or more equitylike than the applicable characteristics of the trust preferred securities or the junior subordinated debentures as applicable at the time of redemption or purchase and ii keycorp has obtained the prior approval of the federal reserve board if such approval is then required by the federal reserve board keycorp will provide a copy of the replacement capital covenants to respective holders of covered debt upon request made in writing to keycorp investor relations 127 public square mail code oh01271113 cleveland oh 441141306

an investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent to our business our industry and ownership of our equity securities described below are certain risks and uncertainties that management has identified as material before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and verification processes in place additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations andor access to liquidity andor credit could be materially and adversely affected “material adverse effect on key” if this were to happen the value of our securities — common shares series a preferred stock series b preferred stock and our trust preferred securities — could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

 

disruptions in financial markets have affected and may continue to affect keycorp management’s actions may be unable to mitigate the extreme external factors presenting market risk 

 

the capital and credit markets including the fixed income markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption since july 2007 during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels uncertainties in these markets present significant challenges particularly for the financial services industry as a financial services company our operations and financial condition are significantly affected by general economic and market conditions for example during 2008 the continued disruptions in the financial markets caused markdowns andor losses by financial institutions from trading hedging and other market activities we were similarly affected for example we recorded an aftertax noncash charge of 420 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to goodwill impairment resulting from a decline in the fair value of our national banking unit reflecting the extreme weakness in financial markets in addition during 2008 we increased our provision for loan losses in response to the deterioration in our loan portfolios resulting from the economic decline in an effort to reduce the potential effects of any prolonged market disruption management has implemented certain strategic decisions including securing additional outside sources of funding for certain of our businesses divesting andor ceasing to conduct certain of our noncore businesses and closely managing growth and investment opportunities it is difficult to predict how long these challenging economic conditions will exist which of our markets products or other businesses will ultimately be affected and whether management’s actions will effectively mitigate these extreme external factors furthermore the models that key uses to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure may become less predictive due to fundamental changes in the us economy accordingly these factors could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding disruptions in financial markets is included in the sections captioned “introduction — economic overview” and “highlights of key’s 2008 performance — financial performance” beginning on pages 18 and 23 respectively of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto additional information regarding certain strategic decisions management has implemented is included in the section captioned “highlights of key’s 2008 performance — strategic developments” on page 28 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto

we are subject to interest rate risk 

 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve board changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings management uses simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth customer behavior new products new business volume product pricing the behavior of market interest rates and anticipated hedging activities simulation analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future risks and trends accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes actual hedging strategies employed changes in balance sheet composition and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events 

although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding interest rate risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — interest rate risk management” beginning on page 54 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to other market risk 

 

traditionally market factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates changes in the equity markets and changes in the financial soundness of bond insurers sureties and even other unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect current market values of financial instruments recent market events have demonstrated this effect to an extreme since july 2007 conditions in the fixed income markets specifically the widening of credit spreads over benchmark us treasury securities for many fixed income securities have caused significant volatility in the market values of loans securities and certain other financial instruments that are held in our trading or heldforsale portfolios although management works to minimize the adverse affects when it is feasible to do so those opportunities are not always available it is possible that such volatility and adverse effects will continue over a prolonged period of time andor worsen over time as such it is not possible for management to predict whether there will be further substantial changes in the financial markets that could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

additional information regarding market risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — trading portfolio risk management” on page 56 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

declining asset prices could adversely affect key 

 

in recent months the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets have experienced have reached extreme levels the market dislocations have led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining credit markets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds have rapidly driven down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable this could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

there can be no assurance that the eesa the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government to restore liquidity and stability to the us financial system will help stabilize the us financial system 

 

the eesa was enacted in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions pursuant to the eesa the us treasury has authority to among other things purchase up to 700 billion of mortgages mortgagebacked securities preferred equity and warrants and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets under its authority provided by eesa the us treasury established the capital purchase program and the core provisions of the financial stability plan there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the eesa or the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the “recovery bill” or programs and other initiatives undertaken by the us government will have on the financial markets the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced may persist the failure of the eesa or other government programs to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on key for additional information on programs and regulatory changes as a result of the eesa including increase in deposit insurance limits and the tlgp and the capital purchase program see the sections captioned “business — supervision and regulation” and “federal deposit insurance act” beginning on pages 3 and 7 respectively and the sections captioned “introduction — economic overview — eesa and the us treasury’s capital purchase program” and “fdic’s standard maximum deposit insurance limit increase and the temporary liquidity guarantee program” each of which begins on page 19 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to 

shareholders exhibit 13 hereto in the event that recent turmoil in the financial markets continues we may experience a material adverse effect on key from 1 continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets 2 continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically 3 limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system or 4 recessionary conditions that are deeper or last longer than currently anticipated 

 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect key 

 

our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services to institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships key has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients during 2008 key incurred 54 million of derivativerelated charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of lehman brothers defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by key cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us while we maintain processes aimed at minimizing such exposures it is not possible to anticipate all of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks completely accordingly there is no assurance that losses from such risks would not have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we are subject to credit risk 

 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor further weakening of economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties 

 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 72 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so however our loan portfolio still contains a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding credit risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management” beginning on page 60 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to liquidity risk 

 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on key certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding have been 

significantly disrupted and highly volatile since the third quarter of 2007 these conditions increase our liquidity risk exposure part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth exiting certain noncore lending businesses utilizing the federal reserve’s term auction facility and the fdic’s tlgp if market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time management may expand the utilization of secured wholesale funding instruments such as the federal reserve’s term auction facility and the issuance of fdicguaranteed debt under the fdic’s tlgp or use other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks and utilizing relationships with fixed income investors in a variety of markets — domestic european and canadian — as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools however there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will remain available and it is unclear what impact given current economic conditions unavailability of such funding would have on key for example in 2007 and 2008 key was unable to securitize its student loan portfolio at costeffective rates accordingly a deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — liquidity risk management” beginning on page 56 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

various factors may cause our allowance for loan losses to increase 

 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense that represents management’s estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses in addition bank regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  ie  if the loan allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses should they become necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management — allowance for loan losses” beginning on page 61 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to operational risk 

 

we like all businesses are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — operational risk management” beginning on page 67 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate although we are somewhat geographically diversified we still do have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are principally located — the northwest the rocky mountains the great lakes and the northeast we also have potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the residential properties segment of our commercial real estate construction portfolio has been adversely affected by the downturn in the us housing market because of deteriorating market conditions principally in florida and southern california and the significant and steady increase in the level of nonperforming loans since the second half of 2007 as a result management recently increased the provision for loan losses the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession an act of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real estate could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on key additional information on the risks of the economic conditions of the geographic regions in which we operate is included in the section captioned “introduction — economic overview” beginning on page 18 and “figure 1 community banking geographic diversity” beginning on page 20 which are part of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate however we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms in recent years while the breadth of the institutions that we compete with has increased competition has intensified as a result of consolidation efforts we expect this trend to continue during 2008 competition intensified as the challenges of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to stronger and larger financial institutions the competitive landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies during the current liquidity crisis due to the access it provides to governmentsponsored sources of liquidity the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 

 16 

 

failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes it is likely that there will be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services industry it is not possible to predict the impact of such changes on our results of operations changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business beginning on page 3 of this report 

 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

 

keycorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its cash flow from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to keycorp during 2008 keybank did not pay any dividends to keycorp nonbank subsidiaries paid keycorp 113234 in dividends as of the close of business on december 31 2008 keybank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a net loss of 1161 billion for 2008 

 

also keycorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to keycorp we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on key additional information regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation — dividend restrictions” in item 1 business beginning on page 4 of this report and in note 5 “restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities” and note 14 “shareholders’ equity” under the heading “preferred stock — series b” on page 91 and beginning on page 102 respectively of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

our earnings may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws 

 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on key although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

we like all businesses are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on key additional information concerning our income tax risks is included in note 17 “income taxes” beginning on page 110 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2008 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 

  

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want andor need in order to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate such employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position our performance including our competitive position could suffer and in turn cause a material adverse effect on key although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees and have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse effect on key because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel for our talented executives andor relationship managers 

 

pursuant to the standardized terms of the capital purchase program among other things we agreed to institute certain restrictions on the compensation of certain senior executive management positions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified senior executives other restrictions may also be imposed under the recovery bill or other legislation or regulations key’s ability to attract andor retain talented 

executives andor relationship managers may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and such restrictions could result in a material adverse effect on key 

 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we continually encounter technological change 

 

the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

 

from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when management deems it is appropriate to do so upon its assessment of the claims whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any reputation damage from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although management has established disaster recovery plans and procedures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on key 

risks associated with our common shares 

 

our issuance of securities to the us treasury may limit key’s ability to return capital to its shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares if we are unable to redeem such preferred shares the dividend rate increases substantially after five years 

 

in connection with our sale of 25 billion of the series b preferred stock to the us treasury in conjunction with its capital purchase program we also issued a warrant to purchase 35244361 of our common shares at an exercise price of 1064 the number of shares was determined based upon the requirements of the capital purchase program and was calculated based on the average market price of our common shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval of our issuance which was also the basis for the exercise price of 1064 the terms of the transaction with the us treasury include limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common shares for three years after the issuance or until the us treasury no longer holds any series b preferred stock we will not be able to increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend declared during the third quarter of 2008 01875 per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our common shares or preferred stock without among other things us treasury approval or the availability of certain limited exceptions  eg  purchases in connection with our benefit plans furthermore as long as the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury is outstanding dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities including our common shares are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock subject to certain limited exceptions these restrictions combined with the dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and as a result they could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

unless we are able to redeem the series b preferred stock during the first five years the dividend payments on this capital will increase substantially at that point from 5 125 million annually to 9 225 million annually depending on market conditions at the time this increase in dividends could significantly impact our liquidity and as a result have a material adverse effect on key 

 

keycorp is required to conduct stress tests pursuant to the us treasury’s capital assistance program and could be required to raise additional capital that would be dilutive to our common shares and may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders 

 

on february 25 2009 the us treasury announced preliminary details of the capital assistance program the “cap” component of its financial stability plan the cap is intended to ensure the continued ability of us financial institutions to lend to creditworthy borrowers in the event of a weaker than expected economic environment and larger than expected potential losses there are two components of cap 1 a supervisory exercise that involves a forwardlooking capital assessment the “stress test” to determine whether any of the major us banking organizations including key need to raise additional capital and 2 access to qualifying financial institutions to mandatory convertible preferred equity intended to serve as a bridge to private capital in the future 

 

participation in cap is mandatory for all bank holding companies with assets in excess of 100 billion like keycorp under the cap institutions are required to conduct a stress test under assumptions provided by the us government following the stress test should the us treasury and key’s banking regulators determine that additional capital is necessary key will have a six month window to raise that capital privately or to access the capital made available by the us treasury under the cap should key need to issue additional equity capital it would be dilutive to our common shares and may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders these factors may have a material adverse effect on key 

 

to view the cap term sheet including a summary of the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the warrant to purchase common shares that the us treasury receives in connection with any cap issuance see wwwfinancialstabilitygov 

our share price can be volatile 

 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common shares when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

  

general market fluctuations market disruption industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results 

 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

 

our common shares are not a bank deposit and therefore are not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

risks associated with our industry 

 

difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry business and results of operations 

 

dramatic declines in the housing market over the past eighteen months with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures unemployment and underemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and commercial and investment banks the resulting writedowns to assets of financial institutions have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital to merge with larger and stronger institutions and in some cases to seek government assistance or bankruptcy protection it is not possible to predict how long these economic conditions will exist which of our markets products or other businesses will ultimately be 

affected and whether management’s actions and government remediation efforts will effectively mitigate these factors accordingly the resulting lack of available credit lack of confidence in the financial sector decreased consumer confidence increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse effect on key furthermore the continued deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse effect on key 

 

as a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions key may face the following risks including but not limited to 

 

  

financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on key 

consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 

 

technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on key

competition 

 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions that offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry and placed added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services in addition competition has intensified as a consequence of the financial modernization laws that were enacted in november 1999 to permit qualifying financial institutions to expand into other activities for example commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions see “financial modernization legislation” on page 7 of this report 

 

supervision and regulation 

 

the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key the regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund the “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” and the banking system as a whole and generally is not intended to protect security holders 

 

set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which the discussion refers changes in applicable laws 

regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

general 

 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over keybank because the domestic deposits in keybank are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 

 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s branchbased and institutional brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the financial industry regulatory authority andor state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

dividend restrictions 

 

the principal source of cash flow to keycorp including cash flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its indebtedness is dividends from its subsidiaries various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by keycorp’s bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions 

 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic see “regulatory capital standards and related matters — prompt corrective action” on page 6 of this report also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 

holding company structure 

 

bank transactions with affiliates federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates bank purchases of assets from 

affiliates and bank sales of assets to affiliates must be on arm’s length terms cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for these purposes a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control while an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding company certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control and certain other companies as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of keybank as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp keybanc capital markets inc any of the victory mutual funds any of the austin capital funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when keycorp may not have the resources to or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company in order of priority of payment 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution that is under common control with another insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of the commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution that is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

 

commercial real estate lending concentrations the banking agencies jointly issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for institutions having concentrations in commercial real estate “cre” loans institutions actively involved in cre lending should perform ongoing risk assessments to identify cre concentrations institutions having such concentrations should have risk management practices that are commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration risk key elements in establishing a risk management framework that effectively identifies monitors and controls cre concentration risk include board and management oversight portfolio management management information systems market analysis credit underwriting standards portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis and credit risk review institutions having such concentrations also should have regulatory capital that is commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration risk in assessing capital adequacy the agencies will consider the level and nature of inherent risk in the cre portfolio as well as management expertise historical performance underwriting standards risk management practices market conditions and any loan loss reserves allocated for cre concentration risk institutions potentially exposed to significant cre concentration risk may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of cre concentration risk such institutions include those that have experienced rapid growth in cre lending have notable exposure to a specific type of cre or are approaching or have exceeded specific quantitative supervisory criteria 

 

elevated risk complex structured finance transactions the banking agencies and the sec published an interagency statement on sound practices concerning elevated risk complex structured finance transactions “csfts” the statement describes the types of risk management principles the banking agencies and the sec believe may help a financial institution identify csfts that may pose heightened levels of legal or reputational risk to the institution as well as evaluate manage and address such risks within the institution’s internal control framework the statement focuses on the maintenance of policies and procedures designed to allow the institution 

to identify evaluate assess document and control the full range of market credit operational legal and reputational risks associated with elevated risk csfts the statement also provides illustrative examples of both structured finance transactions that are not considered to be elevated risk csfts as well as structured finance transactions that may be elevated risk csfts 

 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal laws and regulations define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalancesheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after deducting for investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal holdings of capital instruments by riskweighted assets 

 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk the banking agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital requirements the proposed rule would enhance modeling requirements consistent with advances in risk management enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the current methodologies of the existing requirements and modify the definition of covered position to better capture positions for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate it would also impose an explicit capital requirement for incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity concentrations hedging and optionality at december 31 2007 key’s tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ratios were 744 and 1138 respectively which include required adjustments for market risk 

 

in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 neither keycorp nor any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it at december 31 2007 key’s tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 839 

 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding 

companies at december 31 2007 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary additional information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in the “capital” section beginning on page 42 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests that expose banking organizations primarily to credit risk this treatment includes a concentration limit tier 1 capital charge and a dollarfordollar capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions in asset securitizations 

 

equity investments in nonfinancial companies specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial activities this treatment imposes marginal capital charges applied by making deductions from tier 1 capital that increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to its tier 1 capital such capital charges range from 8 to 25 as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15 to 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital 

 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of an institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority the fdia confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits fdic deposit insurance limits on passthrough deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and expedited action upon regulatory applications 

 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination at december 31 2007 keybank keycorp’s only fdicinsured depository institution subsidiary met the requirements for the “well capitalized” capital category an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or its bank subsidiaries and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding key’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

basel accords the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord that was developed by the international basel committee on 

banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying activities conducted by these organizations 

 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

 

in december 2007 the agencies issued and published a final rule for implementing basel ii in the us while the final rule is effective april 1 2008 implementation is subject to a multiyear transition period in which limits are imposed upon the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease it does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements and explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate application of the final rule to us banking organizations is mandatory for some and optional for others currently neither key nor keybank is required to apply the final rule 

 

fdic deposit insurance 

 

because substantially all of keybank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic keybank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic comprehensive deposit insurance reform legislation was enacted in 2006 pursuant to this legislation the former bank insurance fund and savings association insurance fund were merged into the dif deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts has increased from 100000 to 250000 and deposit insurance limits for accounts are subject to an indexing mechanism for future increases in coverage limits the legislation also requires the fdic to maintain the dif reserve ratio within a range of 115150 of estimated insured deposits with a dif restoration plan being required upon the fdic’s determination that the dif reserve ratio has fallen or will within six months fall below 115 of estimated insured deposits other changes made by this legislation have permitted the fdic to change its previous riskrelated deposit insurance assessment framework under the new assessment framework in 2007 assessed financial institutions’ premiums ranged from 05 to 43 in 2007 compared with zero to 27 throughout 2006 for each 100 of domestic deposits assessed based upon an institution’s capitalization financial ratios or for certain large institutions longterm debt issuer ratings and federal supervisory evaluation this new legislation and the fdic’s new assessment framework implementing it also authorizes certain onetime premium assessment credits and under certain circumstances requires certain dividends from the dif during 2007 keybank received a onetime premium assessment credit of 594 million keybank used 237 million of such premium assessment credit during 2007 towards its deposit insurance premiums 

 

financial modernization legislation 

 

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glasssteagall act to permit commercial banks to among other things have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba key has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic restriction 

the glba also established new privacy protections for customers of financial institutions under federal law a financial institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describe the conditions under which the financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provide an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties 

 

the glba repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings associations from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” and replaced this full exception with functional exceptions under the statute institutions that engage in securities activities either must conduct those activities through a registered brokerdealer or conform their securities activities to those which qualify for functional exceptions the requirements relating to dealer registration have become effective the final requirements relating to broker registration were published on september 19 2007 but their effective date has been delayed until january 1 2009 keycorp is reviewing the impact of these rules on its bank subsidiaries’ operations and expects to be in full compliance with these rules by the effective date 

 

usa patriot act 

 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” and the federal regulations issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing antimoney laundering law and regulation increase compliance due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions create new crimes and penalties and require the federal banking agencies in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions to consider the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities 

 

in june 2007 the occ removed the october 2005 consent order concerning keybank’s bank secrecy act “bsa” and antimoney laundering compliance at that same time the federal reserve bank of cleveland terminated its memorandum of understanding with keycorp concerning bsa and other related matters 

 

management endeavors to assure that all related regulatory requirements are met 

 

fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 

 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 the “fact act” imposes new requirements on financial institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit bureaus the fact act also allows customers to choose to opt out of having certain information shared across a financial institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes final regulations were issued in 2007 concerning the details of this solicitation optout key believes that the changes already implemented will satisfy the material requirements of the solicitation optout and the new regulations promulgated under the fact act implementing it 

 

in addition on october 31 2007 the federal financial regulatory agencies together issued final regulations the “red flag guidelines” implementing sections 114 and 315 of the fact act the red flag guidelines require key to develop and implement an identity theft protection program for new and existing customer accounts and other accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft the identity theft program must be in place no later than november 1 2008 compliance with the red flag guidelines requires key to have a formal program in place that identifies threats assesses risk prioritizes gaps remediates high risk gaps and provides board level reporting key believes that it will be able to implement an identity theft program and achieve regulatory requirements within the time frames provided 

 

entry into certain covenants 

 

keycorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and a third transaction on february 27 2008 each of which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities “trust preferred securities” by delaware statutory trusts formed by keycorp the “trusts” as further described below simultaneously with the closing of each of those transactions keycorp entered into a replacement capital covenant each a “replacement capital covenant” and collectively the “replacement capital covenants” for the benefit of persons that buy or hold specified series of longterm indebtedness of keycorp or its then largest depository institution currently keybank the “covered 

debt” each of the replacement capital covenants provide that neither keycorp nor any of its subsidiaries including any of the trusts will redeem or purchase all or any part of the trust preferred securities or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by keycorp and held by the trust the “junior subordinated debentures” as applicable on or before the date specified in the applicable replacement capital covenant with certain limited exceptions except to the extent that during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or purchase keycorp has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that i have equitylike characteristics that are the same as or more equitylike than the applicable characteristics of the trust preferred securities or the junior subordinated debentures as applicable at the time of redemption or purchase and ii keycorp has obtained the prior approval of the federal reserve board if such approval is then required by the federal reserve board keycorp will provide a copy of the replacement capital covenants to respective holders of covered debt upon request made in writing to keycorp investor relations at 127 public square mail code oh01271113 cleveland oh 441141306

disruptions in financial markets may affect keycorp 

 

since july 2007 certain credit markets have experienced difficult conditions extraordinary volatility and rapidly widening credit spreads and therefore have provided significantly reduced availability of liquidity for many borrowers uncertainties in these markets present significant challenges particularly for the financial services industry as a financial services company our operations and financial condition are affected by economic and market conditions for example in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 disruptions in the financial markets caused widening credit spreads resulting in markdowns andor losses by financial institutions from trading hedging and other market activities we are similarly affected in addition during the fourth quarter of 2007 we significantly increased our provision for loan losses in response to deteriorating market conditions in our commercial real estate portfolio in an effort to reduce the potential effects of any prolonged market disruption management has implemented certain strategic decisions including securing additional outside sources of funding for certain of its businesses divesting andor ceasing to conduct certain of our noncore businesses and closely managing growth and investment opportunities it is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will exist which of our markets products or other businesses will ultimately be affected and whether management’s actions will effectively mitigate these external factors accordingly these factors could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding disruptions in financial markets is included in the section captioned “highlights of key’s 2007 performance — financial outlook” beginning on page 22 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto additional information regarding certain strategic decisions management has implemented is included in the section captioned “highlights of key’s 2007 performance — strategic developments” beginning on page 23 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk 

 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve board changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings management uses simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth customer behavior new products new business volume pricing and anticipated hedging activities simulation analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future risks and trends accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes actual hedging strategies employed changes in balance sheet composition and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events 

 

although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including simulation analysis and the use of derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding interest rate risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — interest rate risk management” beginning on page 46 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

we are subject to other market risk 

 

recent conditions in the fixed income markets specifically the widening of credit spreads over benchmark us treasury securities for many fixed income securities have caused significant volatility in the market values of loans securities and certain other financial instruments that are held in our trading or heldforsale portfolios other market factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates changes in the equity markets changes in the financial soundness of bond insurers sureties and even of other unrelated financial companies also have the potential to affect current market values of financial instruments recent market events have demonstrated this effect although management works to minimize the adverse affects when it is feasible to do so those opportunities are not always available it is not possible for management to predict whether there will be further substantial changes in the financial markets which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

additional information regarding market risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — trading portfolio risk management” beginning on page 48 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to credit risk 

 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties 

 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 74 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so however our loan portfolio still contains a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding credit risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management” beginning on page 51 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

various factors may cause our allowance for possible loan losses to increase 

 

we maintain an allowance for possible loan losses which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense that represents management’s estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for possible loan losses in addition bank regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses ie if the loan allowance is inadequate we will need additional loan loss provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses should they become 

necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management — allowance for loan losses” beginning on page 52 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to liquidity risk 

 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly volatile since the third quarter of 2007 these conditions increase our liquidity risk exposure part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves utilizing the liquidity and stability currently present in the shortterm credit markets borrowings with 090 day maturities at this time management believes shortterm funding opportunities remain available and cost effective however if market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness andor the availability of supply in the shortterm credit market for a prolonged period of time management may utilize other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity including more expansive utilization of secured wholesale funding instruments generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings purchasing deposits from other banks and relationships with fixed income investors in a variety of markets — domestic  european and canadian — as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools however there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will exist either for example in 2007 key was unable to securitize its student loan portfolio at costeffective rates accordingly a deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — liquidity risk management” beginning on page 48 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to operational risk 

 

we like all businesses are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — operational risk management” beginning on page 55 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

 

our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate although we are somewhat geographically diversified assisted in part in this respect by our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and equipment leasing lines of business we still do have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are principally located — the northwest the rocky mountains the great lakes and the northeast we also have potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint for example the residential properties segment of key’s commercial real estate construction portfolio has been 

adversely affected by the downturn in the us housing market because of deteriorating market conditions principally in florida and southern california and the significant increase in the level of nonperforming loans during the second half of 2007 as a result management recently increased the provision for loan losses the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession an act of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real estate could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information on the risks of the economic conditions of the geographic regions in which we operate is included in the section captioned “introduction — economic overview” beginning on page 16 and “figure 1 community banking geographic diversity” beginning on page 17 which are part of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate however we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 

  

failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

 

we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which 

could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business beginning on page 2 of this report 

 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 

 

keycorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its cash flow from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp’s largest subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to keycorp also keycorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to keycorp we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation — dividend restrictions” in item 1 business beginning on page 3 of this report 

 

our earnings may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws 

 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a significant adverse effect on key’s reported financial results although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

 

we like all businesses are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service the “irs” or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

further we are currently involved in litigation previously reported in our sec filings with the irs concerning the tax treatment of one service contract lease entered into by awg leasing trust our management believes our tax position is correct litigation however is uncertain if the litigation is resolved against us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and a potentially substantial impact on our capital additional information concerning our income tax risks is included in the “lease financing transactions” and the “tax— related accounting pronouncements adopted in 2007” sections of note 17 “income taxes” on page 96 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2007 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 

 14 

 

  

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we want andor need although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees and have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we continually encounter technological change 

 

the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

 

from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when management deems it is appropriate to do so upon its assessment of the claims whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market 

perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves andor any reputation damage from such claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although management has established disaster recovery plans and procedures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks associated with our common shares 

 

our share price can be volatile 

 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

  

general market fluctuations market disruption industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results 

 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

 

our common stock is not a bank deposit and therefore is not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

our articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

risks associated with our industry 

 

the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 

 

our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation money supply political issues legislative and regulatory changes fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets broad trends in industry and finance and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate all of which are beyond our control a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 

consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 

 

technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

acquisitions and divestitures 

 

the information presented in note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” on page 75 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference 

 

competition 

 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry and placed added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services in addition competition has intensified as a consequence of the financial modernization laws that were enacted in november 1999 to permit qualifying financial institutions to expand into other activities for example commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions see “financial modernization legislation” on page 8 of this report 

 

supervision and regulation 

 

the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key the regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” and the banking system as a whole and generally is not intended to protect security holders 

 

set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which the discussion refers changes in applicable laws 

regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

general 

 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank national association “kbna” and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because the domestic deposits in kbna are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over kbna 

 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the national association of securities dealers inc the new york stock exchange andor state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

dividend restrictions 

 

the principal source of cash flow to keycorp including cash flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its indebtedness is dividends from its subsidiaries various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by keycorp’s bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions 

 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic see “regulatory capital standards and related matters — prompt corrective action” on page 6 of this report also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 

holding company structure 

 

bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and regulation impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates bank purchases of assets from affiliates and 

bank sales of assets to affiliates must be on arm’s length terms cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for these purposes a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control while an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding company certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control and certain other companies as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of kbna as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp mcdonald investments inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when keycorp may not have the resources to provide it or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company in order of priority of payment 

 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of the commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

 

commercial real estate lending concentrations in december 2006 the banking agencies jointly issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for institutions having concentrations in commercial real estate “cre” loans institutions actively involved in cre lending should perform ongoing risk assessments to identify cre concentrations institutions having such concentrations should have risk management practices that are commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration risk key elements in establishing a risk management framework that effectively identifies monitors and controls cre concentration risk include board and management oversight portfolio management management information systems market analysis credit underwriting standards portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis and credit risk review institutions having such concentrations also should have regulatory capital that is commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration risk in assessing capital adequacy the agencies will consider the level and nature of inherent risk in the cre portfolio as well as management expertise historical performance underwriting standards risk management practices market conditions and any loan loss reserves allocated for cre concentration risk institutions potentially exposed to significant cre concentration risk may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of cre concentration risk such institutions include those that have experienced rapid growth in cre lending have notable exposure to a specific type of cre or are approaching or have exceeded specific quantitative supervisory criteria 

 

elevated risk complex structured finance transactions in january 2007 the banking agencies and the sec published an interagency statement on sound practices concerning elevated risk complex structured finance transactions “csfts” to describe the types of risk management principles they believe may help a financial institution identify csfts that may pose heightened levels of legal or reputational risk to the institution as well as evaluate manage and address such risks within the institution’s internal control framework the statement focuses 

on the maintenance of policies and procedures designed to allow the institution to identify evaluate assess document and control the full range of market credit operational legal and reputational risks associated with elevated risk csfts the statement also provides illustrative examples of both structured finance transactions that are not considered to be elevated risk csfts as well structured finance transactions that may be elevated risk csfts 

 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law and regulation define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalancesheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after deducting for investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal holdings of capital instruments by riskweighted assets 

 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses 

 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk the banking agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital requirements the proposed rule would enhance modeling requirements consistent with advances in risk management enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the current methodologies of the existing requirements and modify the definition of covered position to better capture positions for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate it would also impose an explicit capital requirement for incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity concentrations hedging and optionality in general the proposed rule would become effective in january 2008 at december 31 2006 key’s tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ratios were 824 and 1243 respectively which include required adjustments for market risk 

 

in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 neither keycorp nor any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it at december 31 2006 key’s tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 898 

 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2006 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary additional information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in the “capital” section beginning on page 43 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests that expose banking organizations primarily to credit risk this treatment includes a concentration limit tier 1 capital charge and a dollarfordollar capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions in asset securitizations 

 

equity investments in nonfinancial companies specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial activities this treatment imposes marginal capital charges applied by making deductions from tier 1 capital that increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to its tier 1 capital such capital charges range from 8 to 25 as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15 to 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital 

 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of an institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits fdic deposit insurance limits on passthrough deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and expedited action upon regulatory applications 

 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination at december 31 2006 kbna keycorp’s only fdicinsured depository institution subsidiary met the requirements for the “well capitalized” capital category an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or its bank subsidiaries and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding key’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

basel accords the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the international basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying activities conducted by these organizations 

 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

 

the agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed rule for implementing basel ii in the us the proposed rule would apply to certain organizations on a mandatory basis as well as to those that elect voluntarily to do so organizations that are required or have elected to apply the proposed rule are subject to a transitional implementation timeline of at least 4 years during the transition period limits are imposed upon the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease january 2008 is the earliest start date for the transition period the proposed rule would apply to determine the riskbased capital requirement for wholesale retail equity and securitization exposures and imposes an explicit capital charge for operational risk the basel ii proposed rule does not effect any change in the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements and explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate 

 

the agencies also have developed and published for comment a proposed rule to update their existing basel i riskbased capital standards “basel ia” in order to enhance the risksensitivity of the capital charges to reflect changes in accounting standards and financial markets and to address competitive equity questions that may be raised by us implementation of basel ii the basel ia proposed rule would be available to organizations not covered by the basel ii proposed rule it would be optional in that such an organization could elect to adopt the basel ia proposed rule in its entirety or remain under the existing basel i riskbased capital rules the basel ia proposed rule would increase the number of riskweight categories allow greater use of external credit ratings expand the range of recognized collateral and eligible guarantors use loantovalue ratios to riskweight residential mortgages increase the credit conversion factor for certain shortterm commitments assess a capital charge for early amortizations in securitizations of revolving retail exposures and remove the 50 limit on the riskweight for certain derivative transactions the basel ia proposed rule does not effect any change in the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements and explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations to compute the riskbased capital requirement under the existing basel i riskbased capital rules 

 

fdic deposit insurance 

 

because substantially all of kbna’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic kbna is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic comprehensive deposit insurance reform legislation was enacted in 2006 pursuant to this legislation the former bank insurance fund and savings association insurance fund were merged into the dif deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts has increased from 100000 to 250000 and deposit insurance limits for accounts are subject to an indexing mechanism for future increases in coverage limits the legislation also requires the fdic to maintain the dif reserve ratio within a range of 115150 of estimated insured deposits with a dif restoration plan being required upon the fdic’s determination that the dif reserve ratio has fallen or will within six months fall below 115 of estimated insured deposits other changes made by this legislation have permitted the fdic to change its previous riskrelated deposit insurance assessment framework under the new assessment framework premiums ranging tentatively from 05 to 43 in 2007 compared with zero to 27 throughout 2006 for each 100 of domestic deposits will be assessed based upon an institution’s capitalization financial ratios or for certain large 

institutions longterm debt issuer ratings and federal supervisory evaluation this new legislation and the fdic’s new assessment framework implementing it also authorizes certain premium assessment credits including a onetime assessment credit for kbna of approximately 594 million and under certain circumstances requires certain dividends from the dif 

 

financial modernization legislation 

 

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glasssteagall act to permit commercial banks to among other things have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba key has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies operate its mcdonald investments inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic restriction 

 

the glba also established new privacy protections for customers of financial institutions under federal law a financial institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describe the conditions under which the financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provide an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties 

 

the glba repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings associations from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” and replaced this full exception with functional exceptions under the statute institutions that engage in securities activities either must conduct those activities through a registered brokerdealer or conform their securities activities to those which qualify for functional exceptions while the requirements relating to dealer registration have become effective the effective date of the requirements relating to broker registration has been delayed until july 2007 

 

usa patriot act 

 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” and the federal regulations issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing antimoney laundering law and regulation increase compliance due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions create new crimes and penalties and require the federal banking agencies in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions to consider the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities 

 

in october 2005 kbna consented to the issuance of a consent order “order” from the occ pursuant to which kbna is required to improve its compliance and operations infrastructure designed pursuant to the bank secrecy act “bsa” to detect and prevent money laundering as part of the order kbna has agreed to strengthen its bsa internal controls including the development and implementation of enhanced policies and procedures for bsa compliance to enhance its programs and controls for suspicious activity reporting to enhance its bsa audit functions and its independent audit program and to improve employee training relating to the detection and prevention of money laundering at the same time keycorp entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” with the federal reserve bank of cleveland “frb” covering compliance with the bsa and other related matters neither the occ nor the frb imposed a fine or civil money penalty in connection with these actions 

 

keycorp and kbna have taken significant steps to strengthen the organizations’ compliance policies and procedures and operations infrastructure in areas related to those specified in the order and the mou as well as in other respects management is committed to ensuring that all of the requirements of these regulatory actions are met 

 

fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 

 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 “fact act” imposes new requirements on financial institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit bureaus the fact act also allows customers to choose to opt out of having certain information shared across a financial institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes compliance with the fact act requires key to modify numerous computer systems and to make operational changes in several business areas key believes that the changes that it has already made or will implement in 2007 will satisfy the material requirements of the fact act and the current regulations implementing it although additional fact act implementing regulations are still pending that may mandate additional disclosures or impose system or process changes key believes that it will be able to implement any new regulatory requirements within the time frames provided 

 

entry into certain covenants 

 

in 2006 keycorp entered into two transactions involving the issuance of trust preferred securities “trust preferred securities” by delaware statutory trusts formed by keycorp the “trusts” as further described below simultaneously with the closing of each of those transactions keycorp entered into a replacement capital covenant each a “replacement capital covenant” and collectively the “replacement capital covenants” for the benefit of persons that buy hold or sell a specified series of longterm indebtedness of keycorp or its then largest depository institution currently kbna the “covered debt” each of the replacement capital covenants provide that neither keycorp nor any of its subsidiaries including any of the trusts will redeem or purchase all or any part of the trust preferred securities or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by keycorp and held by the trust the “junior subordinated debentures” as applicable on or before the date specified in the applicable replacement capital covenant with certain limited exceptions except to the extent that during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or purchase keycorp has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that i have equitylike characteristics that are the same as or more equitylike than the applicable characteristics of the trust preferred securities or the junior subordinated debentures as applicable at the time of redemption or purchase and ii keycorp has obtained the prior approval of the federal reserve board if such approval is then required by the federal reserve board keycorp will provide a copy of the replacement capital covenants to respective holders of covered debt upon request made in writing to keycorp investor relations at 127 public square mail code oh01271113 cleveland oh 441141306

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

an investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or 

incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and verification processes in place additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

 

if any of the following risks actually occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of our common shares could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to interest rate risk 

 

our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve board changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

 

although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding interest rate risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — interest rate risk management” beginning on page 47 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to other market risk in addition to interest rate risk 

 

the values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other marketdriven rates or prices for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline if market interest rates increase similarly the value of the us dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces “market risk” 

 

although management believes it has implemented effective strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolio any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in those factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding market risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — trading portfolio risk management” beginning on page 49 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to credit risk 

 

there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties 

 

as of december 31 2006 approximately 734 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans and leases are generally viewed as potentially having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans although we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so our loan portfolio still does contain a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding credit risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management” beginning on page 49 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

various factors may cause our allowance for possible loan losses to increase 

 

we maintain an allowance for possible loan losses which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense that represents management’s estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for possible loan losses in addition bank regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses should they become necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management — allowance for loan losses” beginning on page 50 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to liquidity risk 

 

market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of liquidity affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — liquidity risk management” beginning on page 54 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

we are subject to operational risk 

 

we like all businesses are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs 

harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — operational risk management” beginning on page 57 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2006 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 

our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 

 

our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which we operate although we are somewhat geographically diversified assisted in part in this respect by our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and equipment leasing lines of business we still do have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our keycenters are principally located — the midwest the northeast and the pacific northwest the regional economic conditions in these areas have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession acts of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 

 

we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate however we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 

  

failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 

 

we primarily through kbna and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or 

expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business beginning on page 2 of this report 

 

our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 

 

management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 

 

keycorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that kbna and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to keycorp also keycorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event kbna is unable to pay dividends to keycorp we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares the inability to receive dividends from kbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business beginning on page 2 of this report 

 

potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 

 

acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 

  

we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may 

occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 

 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we want andor need although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees and have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

 

our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 

 

we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we continually encounter technological change 

 

the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to claims and litigation 

 

from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal action against us whether these claims and legal action are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our earnings may be affected by changes in accounting principles and in tax laws 

 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a significant adverse effect on key’s reported financial results although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

 

we like all businesses are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue 

service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 

 

severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although management has established disaster recovery plans and procedures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks associated with our common shares 

 

our share price can be volatile 

 

share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

  

general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results 

 

an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 

 

our common stock is not a bank deposit and therefore is not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

 

our articles of incorporation regulations and shareholders rights plan as well as certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect 

 

provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements and our stock purchase rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a 

nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

risks associated with our industry 

 

the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 

 

our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation money supply political issues legislative and regulatory changes fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets broad trends in industry and finance and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate all of which are beyond our control a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 

 

in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 

consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 

 

technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry and placed added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services in addition competition has intensified as a consequence of the financial modernization laws that were enacted in november 1999 to permit qualifying financial institutions to expand into other activities for example commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions see “financial modernization legislation” on page 7 of this report 

supervision and regulation 

the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key the regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” and the banking system as a whole and generally is not intended to protect security holders 

set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which the discussion refers changes in applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank national association “kbna” and one national bank 

2 subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary both of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because the deposits in kbna are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over kbna 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the national association of securities dealers inc the new york stock exchange andor state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 the principal source of cash flow to keycorp including cash flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its indebtedness is dividends from its subsidiaries various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by keycorp’s bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic see “regulatory capital standards and related matters — prompt corrective action” on page 6 of this report also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

 bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and regulation impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates transactions covered by these provisions which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates bank purchases of assets from affiliates and bank sales of assets to affiliates must be on arm’s length terms cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for these purposes a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control while an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding company certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control and certain other companies as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of kbna as a bank to fund its affiliates including keycorp mcdonald investments inc any of the victory mutual funds and keycorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a 

3 time when keycorp may not have the resources to provide it or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company in order of priority of payment 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of the commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

 riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law and regulation define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalancesheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after deducting for investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal holdings of capital instruments by riskweighted assets 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk at december 31 2005 key’s tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ratios were 759 and 1147 respectively which include required adjustments for market risk 

4 in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 neither keycorp nor any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it at december 31 2005 key’s tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 853 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2005 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary additional information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in the “capital” section beginning on page 34 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests that expose banking organizations primarily to credit risk this treatment includes a concentration limit tier 1 capital charge and a dollarfordollar capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions in asset securitizations 

equity investments in nonfinancial companies specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial activities this treatment imposes marginal capital charges applied by making deductions from tier 1 capital that increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to its tier 1 capital such capital charges range from 8 to 25 as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15 to 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital 

subprime lending the federal banking agencies have heightened supervisory expectations with respect to required levels of capital for institutions with subprime lending programs for these purposes a subprime lending program is one that targets borrowers with weakened credit histories or questionable repayment capacity in addition to regulatory capital subprime lending supervisory guidance addresses supervisory expectations with respect to risk management the allowance for loan and lease losses portfolio and transaction level examination review analysis and classification cure program documentation and predatory or abusive lending practices 

while this guidance principally applies to institutions with subprime lending programs having an aggregate credit exposure of at least 25 of tier 1 capital federal bank examiners may apply it to other subprime portfolios such as those that are experiencing rapid growth or adverse performance trends those that are administered by inexperienced management and those that possess inadequate or weak controls for an institution that has subprime lending portfolio exposure equal to 25 or more of the institution’s tier 1 capital the supervisory guidance indicates that examiners are likely to require that institution to hold capital in an amount that is 15 to 30 times greater than what is required for a portfolio of nonsubprime assets of a similar 

5 type neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised key of any capital deficiency under this guidance 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of an institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits fdic deposit insurance limits on passthrough deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and expedited action upon regulatory applications 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination at december 31 2005 kbna keycorp’s only fdicinsured depository institution subsidiary met the requirements for the “well capitalized” capital category an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or its bank subsidiaries and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding key’s financial condition and results of operations 

basel accords the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on a 1988 international accord “basel i” that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision currently having member central bank and bank supervision authority representation from belgium canada france germany italy japan luxembourg the netherlands spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states in 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document “basel ii” governing the capital adequacy of large internationally active banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems basel ii is designed to create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk measurement and management processes and to better align minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying activities conducted by these organizations 

basel ii adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

the agencies are developing a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide banking organizations with a more definitive proposal for implementing basel ii in the us they expect to propose a revised basel ii transitional implementation timeline beginning in january 2008 and ending in december 2011 in addition the agencies 

6 have indicated that the basel ii proposal will not change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements 

the agencies are also developing a notice of proposed rulemaking to update their existing basel i riskbased capital standards in order to enhance the risksensitivity of the capital charges to reflect changes in accounting standards and financial markets and to address competitive equity questions that may be raised by us implementation of basel ii the agencies also have indicated that the basel i proposal will not change the existing leverage capital requirements 

the agencies expect to publish both the basel i and basel ii proposed rulemaking notices in similar time frames in 2006 

fdic deposit insurance 

because substantially all of kbna’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic kbna is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic to maintain the bank insurance fund “bif” and the savings association insurance fund “saif” of the fdic the fdic has adopted a riskrelated deposit insurance assessment system under which premiums ranging in 2005 from zero to 27 for each 100 of domestic deposits are imposed based upon the depository institution’s capitalization and federal supervisory evaluation kbna in 2005 qualified for a deposit insurance assessment rate of zero the fdic is authorized to increase deposit insurance premium assessments in certain circumstances any such increase would have an adverse effect on key’s results of operations 

in february 2006 comprehensive deposit insurance reform legislation was enacted under this legislation bif and saif will be merged into a single deposit insurance fund “dif” deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts will increase from 100000 to 250000 deposit insurance limits for accounts will be subject to an indexing mechanism for future increases in coverage limits and the fixed 125 reserve ratios for bif and saif under current law will be replaced by a reserve ratio for dif which will be set annually by the fdic within a reserve ratio range of between 115 and 150 the legislation also authorizes the fdic to revise the current riskbased deposit insurance premium assessment system and to prescribe dif restoration plans in the event that the dif reserve ratio were to fall below 115 it also authorizes certain premium assessment credits and under certain circumstances requires certain dif dividends since implementation of this legislation requires fdic rulemaking which is not required to be complete until november 2006 the financial impact of this legislation upon insured depository institutions including kbna cannot yet be determined

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glass  steagall act to permit commercial banks to among other things have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba key has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies operate its mcdonald investments inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic restriction 

the glba also established new privacy protections for customers of financial institutions under federal law a financial institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describe the conditions under which the financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provide an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties 

7 the glba repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings associations from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” and replaced this full exception with functional exceptions under the statute institutions that engage in securities activities either must conduct those activities through a registered brokerdealer or conform their securities activities to those which qualify for functional exceptions while the requirements relating to dealer registration became effective in september 2003 the sec has delayed the effective date of the requirements relating to broker registration until september 2006 at the earliest 

usa patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” and the federal regulations issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing antimoney laundering law and regulation increase compliance due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions create new crimes and penalties and require the federal banking agencies in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions to consider the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities 

in october 2005 kbna consented to the issuance of a consent order “order” from the occ pursuant to which kbna is required to improve its compliance and operations infrastructure designed pursuant to the bank secrecy act “bsa” to detect and prevent money laundering as part of the order kbna has agreed to strengthen its bsa internal controls including the development and implementation of enhanced policies and procedures for bsa compliance to enhance its programs and controls for suspicious activity reporting to enhance its bsa audit functions and its independent audit program and to improve employee training relating to the detection and prevention of money laundering at the same time keycorp entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” with the federal reserve bank of cleveland “frb” covering compliance with the bsa and other related matters neither the occ nor the frb imposed a fine or civil money penalty in connection with these actions 

keycorp and kbna have taken significant steps to strengthen the organizations’ compliance policies and procedures and operations infrastructure in areas related to those specified in the order and the mou as well as in other respects management is committed to ensuring that all of the requirements of these regulatory actions are met 

fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 “fact act” imposes new requirements on financial institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit bureaus the fact act also allows customers to choose to opt out of having certain information shared across a financial institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes compliance with the fact act requires key to modify numerous computer systems and to make operational changes in several business areas key believes that the changes that it has already made or will implement in 2006 will satisfy the material requirements of the fact act and the current regulations implementing it although additional fact act implementing regulations are still pending that may mandate additional disclosures or impose system or process changes key believes that it will be able to implement any new regulatory requirements within the time frames provided

 item 1a risk factors tableend an investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face although we have significant risk management policies procedures and verification processes in place additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 

8 if any of the following risks actually occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of our common shares could decline perhaps significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

 our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve board changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 

although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding interest rate risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — interest rate risk management” beginning on page 38 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 the values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other marketdriven rates or prices for example the value of a fixedrate bond will decline if market interest rates increase similarly the value of the us dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces “market risk” 

although management believes it has implemented effective strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolio any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in those factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding market risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — market risk management — trading portfolio risk management” beginning on page 41 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities these risks include among other things the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate increases in interest rates andor weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans we also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties 

9 as of december 31 2005 approximately 698 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial financial and agricultural loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans and leases are generally viewed as potentially having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans although we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and utilize various portfolio management practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so our loan portfolio still does contain a number of commercial loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding credit risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management” beginning on page 42 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 we maintain an allowance for possible loan losses which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense that represents management’s estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for possible loan losses in addition bank regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses should they become necessary would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the section captioned “risk management — credit risk management — allowance for loan losses” beginning on page 42 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of liquidity affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions any substantial unexpected andor prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — liquidity risk management” beginning on page 46 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 we like all businesses are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events operational risk also encompasses compliance legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned “risk management — operational risk management” beginning on page 48 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2005 annual report to shareholders exhibit 13 hereto 

 our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which we operate although we are somewhat geographically diversified assisted in part in this respect by our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and equipment leasing lines of business we still do have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our keycenters are principally located — the midwest northeast and pacific northwest the regional economic conditions in these areas have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession acts of terrorism outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors could also impact these regional economies and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate however we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national financial services firms the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things 

 11 failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 we primarily through kbna and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies andor continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to appropriately comply with laws regulations or policies including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business beginning on page 2 of this report 

 management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 keycorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that kbna and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to keycorp also keycorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors in the event kbna is unable to pay dividends to keycorp we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares the inability to receive dividends from kbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional information regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section captioned “supervision and regulation” in item 1 business on page 3 of this report 

 acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things 

 12 

 we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result merger or acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we want andor need although we maintain employment agreements with certain key employees and have incentive compensation plans aimed in part at longterm employee retention the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still occur and such events may have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of the employee’s skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

 we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 from time to time customers andor vendors may make claims and take legal action against us whether these claims and legal action are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 changes in us generally accepted accounting principles could have a significant adverse effect on key’s reported financial results although these changes may not have an economic impact on our business they could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures 

we like all businesses are subject to tax laws rules and regulations changes to tax laws rules and regulations including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws rules and regulations by the internal revenue service or other governmental bodies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs among other things failure to appropriately comply with tax laws rules and regulations could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 severe weather natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses for example during 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita caused extensive flooding and destruction along the coastal areas of the gulf of mexico while we were not significantly and adversely affected by the impact of these specific disasters other severe weather or natural disasters acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future that do have an effect on our business although management has established disaster recovery plans and procedures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our common shares 

 share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive our share price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 14 

 general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our share price to decrease regardless of operating results 

 our common stock is not a bank deposit and therefore is not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company as a result if you acquire our common shares you may lose some or all of your investment 

 provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements and our stock purchase rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

risks associated with our industry 

 our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation money supply political issues legislative and regulatory changes fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets broad trends in industry and finance and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate all of which are beyond our control a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations 

 technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete through alternative methods financial transactions that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds in 

15 brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as “disintermediation” could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

competition 

the market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive keycorp and its subsidiaries “key” compete with other providers of financial services such as bank holding companies commercial banks savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices 

in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry and placed added competitive pressure on key’s core banking products and services in addition competition has intensified as a consequence of the financial modernization laws that were enacted in november 1999 and permit qualifying financial institutions to expand into other activities for example commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions see “financial modernization legislation” on page 7 

supervision and regulation

set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which the discussion refers changes in 

2 applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

general 

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank national association “kbna” and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because the deposits in kbna are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over kbna 

keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the national association of securities dealers inc or the new york stock exchange and state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

dividend restrictions 

the principal source of cash flow to keycorp including cash flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its indebtedness is dividends from its subsidiaries various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by keycorp’s bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions 

if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend i if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” or ii while it is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic see “regulatory capital standards and related matters – prompt corrective action” also the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 

holding company structure 

transactions involving bank subsidiaries keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their operating subsidiaries are subject to federal reserve act provisions which impose qualitative standards and 

3 quantitative limitations upon certain transactions with or involving keycorp and its nonbank subsidiaries which are not operating subsidiaries of keycorp’s national banks transactions covered by these provisions which include loans and other extensions of credit as well as purchases and sales of assets must be on arm’s length terms cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for example the aggregate of all such outstanding covered transactions by kbna including its operating subsidiaries with or involving keycorp was limited at december 31 2004 to approximately 20 billion as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries to fund keycorp and its nonbank subsidiaries 

source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required at a time when keycorp may not have the resources to provide it or would choose not to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company in order of priority of payment 

liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of the commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 

regulatory capital standards and related matters 

riskbased and leverage regulatory capital federal law and regulation define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities 

bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalancesheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital which cannot exceed the amount of tier 1 capital after deducting for investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal holdings of capital instruments by riskweighted assets 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory 

4 convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses 

bank holding companies such as keycorp whose securities and commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk at december 31 2004 key’s tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ratios were 722 and 1147 respectively which include required adjustments for market risk 

in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 neither keycorp nor any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it at december 31 2004 key’s tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 796 

keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2004 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements 

in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary additional information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in the “capital” section beginning on page 32 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2004 annual report to shareholders 

recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests  specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests that expose banking organizations primarily to credit risk this treatment includes a concentration limit tier 1 capital charge and a dollarfordollar capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions in asset securitizations 

equity investments in nonfinancial companies  specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial activities this treatment imposes marginal capital charges applied by making deductions from tier 1 capital that increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to its tier 1 capital such capital charges range from 8 to 25 as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15 to 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital 

subprime lending the federal banking agencies have heightened supervisory expectations with respect to required levels of capital for institutions with subprime lending programs for these purposes a subprime lending program is one that targets borrowers with weakened credit histories or questionable repayment capacity in addition to regulatory capital subprime lending supervisory guidance addresses supervisory expectations with respect to risk management the allowance for loan and lease losses portfolio and 

5 transaction level examination review analysis and classification cure program documentation and predatory or abusive lending practices 

while this guidance principally applies to institutions with subprime lending programs having an aggregate credit exposure of at least 25 of tier 1 capital federal bank examiners may apply it to other subprime portfolios such as those that are experiencing rapid growth or adverse performance trends those that are administered by inexperienced management and those that possess inadequate or weak controls for an institution that has subprime lending portfolio exposure equal to 25 or more of the institution’s tier 1 capital the supervisory guidance indicates that examiners are likely to require that institution to hold capital in an amount that is 15 to 30 times greater than what is required for a portfolio of nonsubprime assets of a similar type neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised key of any capital deficiency under this guidance 

basel ii accord the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the us federal banking agencies are based on an international accord that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision having member central bank and bank supervision authority representation from belgium canada france germany italy japan luxembourg the netherlands spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states in june 2004 the basel committee published its new capital framework document the “basel ii accord” governing the capital adequacy of internationally active banking organizations the basel ii accord will form the basis upon which the agencies will develop proposed revisions to existing riskbased capital adequacy regulations and standards the agencies anticipate publishing these proposed revisions in 2005 and that the basel ii accord will become fully effective in the united states in january 2008 

the basel ii accord adopts a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital 

the agencies expect that only a small number of large internationally active us banking organizations would be required to use the basel ii accord and that those institutions would use only the most advanced approaches for determining their riskbased capital requirements application of the basel ii accord’s advanced approaches to other qualifying us banking organizations would be at the organization’s option 

prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of an institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits fdic deposit insurance limits on passthrough deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and expedited action upon regulatory applications fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories – well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized – using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 

6 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination and is not well capitalized at december 31 2004 kbna keycorp’s only fdicinsured depository institution subsidiary met the requirements for the “well capitalized” capital category an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or its bank subsidiaries and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding key’s financial condition and results of operations 

fdic deposit insurance 

because substantially all of kbna’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic kbna is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic to maintain the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund of the fdic the fdic has adopted a riskrelated deposit insurance assessment system under which premiums ranging in 2004 from zero to 27 for each 100 of domestic deposits are imposed based upon the depository institution’s capitalization and federal supervisory evaluation kbna in 2004 qualified for a deposit insurance assessment rate of zero the fdic is authorized to increase deposit insurance premium assessments in certain circumstances any such increase would have an adverse effect on key’s results of operations 

financial modernization legislation 

the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glass–steagall act to permit commercial banks among other things to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba key has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies operate its mcdonald investments inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic restriction 

the glba also established new privacy protections for customers of financial institutions under federal law a financial institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describe the conditions under which the financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provide an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties 

the glba repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings associations from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” and replaced this full exception with functional exceptions under the statute institutions that engage in securities activities either must conduct those activities through a registered brokerdealer or conform their securities activities to those which qualify for functional exceptions while the requirements relating to dealer registration became effective in september 2003 the sec has delayed the effective date of the requirements relating to broker registration until march 2005 at the earliest 

usa patriot act 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” and the federal regulations issued pursuant to it 

7 substantially broaden previously existing antimoney laundering law and regulation increase compliance due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions create new crimes and penalties and require the federal banking agencies in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions to consider the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities key believes its compliance policies procedures and controls satisfy the material requirements of the usa patriot act and the regulations implementing it that are applicable to key 

fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 “fact act” imposes new requirements on financial institutions regarding identify theft and reporting to credit bureaus the fact act also allows customers to choose to opt out of having certain information shared across a financial institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes certain provisions of the fact act became effective at the end of 2004 and the remainder will go into effect on various dates in 2005 compliance with the fact act requires key to modify numerous computer systems and to make operational changes in several business areas key believes that the changes that it has already made or will implement in 2005 will satisfy the material requirements of the fact act and the regulations implementing it

which offer financial services key competes by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices in recent years mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the

securities underwrite insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain conditions see “financial modernization legislation” on page 7 supervision and regulation the following discussion addresses certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information regarding key the regulatory

not intended to protect security holders set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to key this discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes regulations and regulatory agency policies to which the discussion refers changes in 2   applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted by management yet such changes may have a material effect on key’s business financial condition or results of operations 

general as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” under the bhca under the bhca bank holding companies may not in general directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board in addition bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities keycorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by applicable federal banking agencies keycorp operates two fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiaries keybank national association “kbna” and key bank usa national association “key bank usa” and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary all of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the “occ” because the deposits in kbna and key bank usa are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic the fdic also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over both banking subsidiaries keycorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations for example keycorp’s brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the national association of securities dealers inc or the new york stock exchange and state securities regulators and keycorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states other nonbank subsidiaries of keycorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business 

 

 the principal source of cash flow to keycorp including cash flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its indebtedness is dividends from its subsidiaries various statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by keycorp’s bank subsidiaries without regulatory approval the approval of the occ is required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of i the bank’s net income for the current year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent of its undivided profits all of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of the institution could include the payment of dividends the agency may require after notice and hearing that such institution cease and desist from such practice the occ and the fdic have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound practice moreover under the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become less than “adequately capitalized” nor may such an institution pay any dividend while it is in default in the payment of any assessment due to the fdic see “regulatory capital standards and related matters – prompt corrective action” also the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings 3   

 

 transactions involving bank subsidiaries keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their operating subsidiaries are subject to federal reserve act provisions which impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions with or involving keycorp and its nonbank subsidiaries which are not operating subsidiaries of keycorp’s national banks transactions covered by these provisions which include loans and other extensions of credit as well as purchases and sales of assets must be on arm’s length terms cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital and if a loan or other extension of credit must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute for example the aggregate of all such outstanding covered transactions by kbna and key bank usa including their operating subsidiaries with or involving keycorp and its nonbank subsidiaries that are not operating subsidiaries of kbna and key bank usa was limited at december 31 2003 to approximately 19 billion as a result these provisions materially restrict the ability of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries and their operating subsidiaries to fund keycorp and its nonbank subsidiaries that are not operating subsidiaries of keycorp’s national banks source of strength doctrine under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and under appropriate circumstances to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when keycorp may not have the resources to provide it or for other reasons would not otherwise be inclined to provide it certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition the crime control act of 1990 provides that in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims by the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including a parent holding company in order of priority of payment liability of commonly controlled institutions under the fdia an insured depository institution which is under common control with another insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of such commonly controlled institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to such commonly controlled institution which is in danger of default the term “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance regulatory capital standards and related matters riskbased and leverage regulatory capital applicable law and regulation define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities including acquisitions expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities bank holding companies are subject to riskbased capital guidelines adopted by the federal reserve board these guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets qualifying capital includes tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital riskweighted assets are calculated by assigning varying riskweights to broad categories of assets and offbalancesheet exposures based primarily on counterparty credit risk the required minimum tier 1 riskbased capital ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by riskweighted assets is currently 400 the required minimum total riskbased capital ratio is currently 800 it 4   is calculated by dividing the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital not in excess of tier 1 capital after deductions for investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal holdings of capital instruments by riskweighted assets 

tier 1 capital includes common equity qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets including goodwill and certain other assets tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments perpetual debt mandatory convertible debt securities perpetual preferred equity not includable in tier 1 capital and limited amounts of term subordinated debt mediumterm preferred equity certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses bank holding companies such as keycorp whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors such as idiosyncratic variation event risk and default risk at december 31 2003 key’s tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ratios were 835 and 1257 respectively which include required adjustments for market risk in addition to the riskbased standard bank holding companies are subject to the federal reserve board’s leverage ratio guidelines these guidelines establish minimum ratios of tier 1 capital to total assets the minimum leverage ratio calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by average total consolidated assets is 300 for bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve board’s riskbased capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 400 neither keycorp nor any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it at december 31 2003 key’s tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 855 keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to riskbased and leverage capital requirements adopted by the occ which are substantially similar to those imposed by the federal reserve board on bank holding companies at december 31 2003 each of keycorp’s national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum riskbased and leverage capital requirements in addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries the riskbased and leverage capital guidelines also identify various organizationspecific factors and risks that are not taken into account in the computation of the capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular organization neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised keycorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any specific minimum riskbased or leverage capital ratio applicable to keycorp or such national bank subsidiary additional information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in the “capital” section beginning on page 30 of the financial review section of keycorp’s 2003 annual report to shareholders recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests that expose banking organizations primarily to credit risk this treatment includes a concentration limit consisting of a tier 1 capital charge and a dollarfordollar capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions in asset securitizations equity investments in nonfinancial companies specialized regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial activities this treatment imposes marginal capital charges applied by making deductions from tier 1 capital that increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments increase in 5   relation to its tier 1 capital such capital charges range from 8 to 25 as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15 to 25 of the banking organization’s tier 1 capital 

subprime lending the federal banking agencies have heightened their supervisory expectations with respect to required levels of capital for institutions with subprime lending programs for these purposes a subprime lending program is one that targets borrowers with weakened credit histories or questionable repayment capacity in addition to regulatory capital the supervisory guidance regarding subprime lending addresses supervisory expectations with respect to risk management the allowance for loan and lease losses portfolio and transaction level examination review analysis and classification cure program documentation and predatory or abusive lending practices while this guidance principally applies to institutions with subprime lending programs having an aggregate credit exposure of at least 25 of tier 1 capital federal banking examiners may apply it to other subprime portfolios such as those that are experiencing rapid growth or adverse performance trends those that are administered by inexperienced management and those that possess inadequate or weak controls for an institution having subprime lending portfolio exposure aggregating 25 or more of the institution’s tier 1 capital the supervisory guidance indicates examiners will likely expect as a minimum that the institution would hold capital against such portfolio in an amount that is 15 to 30 times greater than what is appropriate for nonsubprime assets of a similar type the federal banking agencies have indicated however that the guidance is neither intended nor considered by the agencies to be a capital regulation and does not represent a change in policy by the agencies moreover the agencies have also indicated that examiners would not unilaterally require additional reserves or capital based upon the guidance and that any determination made by an examiner that an institution’s reserves or capital is deficient would be discussed with the institution’s management and each agency’s appropriate supervisory office before a final decision is made neither the federal reserve board nor the occ has advised key of any such deficiency new basel accord the current minimum riskbased capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on an international accord for capital measurement that was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision having member central bank and bank supervision authority representation from belgium canada france germany italy japan luxembourg the netherlands spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states in april 2003 the basel committee released for public consultation a new capital framework document proposing revisions to the current basel capital accord the new basel capital accord would adopt a threepillar framework for addressing capital adequacyminimum capital requirements supervisory review and market discipline the minimum capital requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit operational and market risk exposures of a banking organization the supervisory review pillar addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement as well as the need for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy assessment the market discipline pillar imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are intended to allow market participants to assess key information about the organization’s risk profile and its associated level of capital the basel committee expects to finalize its new capital accord in 2004 with a yearend 2006 target implementation date the federal banking agencies have indicated that that they do not expect that the implementation of the new basel accord will result in any significant decrease in aggregate capital requirements for the us banking system the agencies also have indicated that individual banking organizations may face increases or decreases in their minimum riskbased capital requirements because the new basel accord is more risksensitive than the current basel accord and the agencies’ existing riskbased capital regulations prompt corrective action the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the fdia added by the fdic improvement act of 1991“fdicia” create a statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of fdicinsured depository institutions these provisions impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions of the institution as its regulatory capital decreases or in some cases based on 6   supervisory information other than the institution’s capital level this framework and the authority it confers on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital deficiencies moreover other provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or similar to those established by the prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon institutions these include restrictions on brokered deposits fdic deposit insurance limits on passthrough deposits limits on exposure to interbank liabilities riskbased fdic deposit insurance premium assessments and expedited action upon regulatory applications 

fdicinsured depository institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories – well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized – using the tier 1 riskbased total riskbased and tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 1000 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 600 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 500 and is not subject to any written agreement order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an adequately capitalized institution must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 800 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 400 and a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 400 300 if it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent examination and is not well capitalized at december 31 2003 each keycorp insured depository institution subsidiary met the requirements for the “well capitalized” capital category an institution’s prompt corrective action capital category however may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or its bank subsidiaries and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding key’s financial condition and results of operations fdic deposit insurance because substantially all of the deposits of keycorp’s depository institution subsidiaries are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic these subsidiaries are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the fdic to maintain the bank insurance fund the “bif” and the savings association insurance fund the “saif” of the fdic the fdic has adopted a riskrelated deposit insurance assessment system under which premiums ranging in 2003 from zero to 27 for each 100 of domestic deposits are imposed based upon the depository institution’s capitalization and federal supervisory evaluation each of keycorp’s depository institution subsidiaries in 2003 qualified for a deposit insurance assessment rate of zero the fdic is authorized to increase deposit insurance premium assessments in certain circumstances any such increase would have an adverse effect on key’s results of operations enactment into law of pending proposed legislation seeking among other things to increase federal deposit insurance coverage limits impose minimum mandatory deposit insurance premiums and replace the current fixed 125 designated reserve ratio with one determined by the fdic within a range of 115 to 140 would be expected to adversely affect the results of operations of all insured depository institutions including kbna and key bank usa financial modernization legislation the grammleachbliley act of 1999 the “glba” authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions the glba repealed significant provisions of the glass–steagall act to permit commercial banks among other things to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make merchant banking investments provided certain conditions are met the glba modified the bhca to permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified standards known as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broader range of financial activities than previously permitted under the bhca and allowed subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified standards known as “financial subsidiaries” to engage in a wide range of financial activities that are prohibited to such banks themselves under certain circumstances in 2000 keycorp elected to become a financial holding company under the authority conferred by the glba key has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies operate 7   its mcdonald investments inc subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing activities and insurance agency activities without geographic restriction 

glba also established new requirements for financial institutions to provide new privacy protections to consumers the federal banking agencies jointly adopted a final regulation providing for the implementation of these protections it requires a financial institution to provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices describes under what conditions a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties and provides an “optout” method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties financial institutions were required to be in compliance with the final regulation by july 1 2001 glba repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings associations from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” and replaced this full exception with functional exceptions under the statute institutions that engage in securities activities either must conduct those activities through a registered brokerdealer or conform their securities activities to those which qualify for functional exceptions while the requirements relating to dealer registration became effective in september 2003 the sec has delayed the effective date of the requirements relating to broker registration until november 2004 at the earliest usa patriot act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” and the federal regulations issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing antimoney laundering law and regulation increase compliance due diligence and reporting obligations for financial institutions and create new crimes and penalties key believes its compliance policies procedures and controls satisfy the material requirements of the usa patriot act and the regulations implementing it that are applicable to key

item 14  controls and procedures

as a bank holding company keycorp is subject to the internal control reporting
requirements of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act which
became effective in 1993 fdicia fdicia requirements include an annual
assessment by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting which generally
include those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states in addition under fdicia our independent auditors have annually
examined and attested to without qualification managements assertions
regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls accordingly we have had
an established process of maintaining and evaluating our internal controls over
financial reporting

in connection with recent legislation and regulations our management has also
focused its attention on our disclosure controls and procedures which as
defined by the sec are generally those controls and procedures designed to
ensure that financial and nonfinancial information required to be disclosed in
keycorps reports filed with the sec is recorded processed summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to keycorps management
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in light
of the new requirements we have engaged in a process of reviewing our
disclosure controls and procedures as a result of our review and although we
believe that our preexisting disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in enabling us to comply with our disclosure obligations we have implemented
enhancements which include establishing a disclosure committee and generally
formalizing and documenting disclosure controls and procedures that we already
have in place any future refinements to our controls and procedures will
continue to build upon our existing framework

following the review described above and the establishment of our disclosure
committee and within the 90day period prior to the filing of this report
keycorp carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of keycorps management including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
keycorps disclosure controls and procedures based upon that evaluation
keycorps chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective
there have been no significant changes in internal controls that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer completed their evaluation
